I. INTRODUCTION


A broad class of communication systems can be cast as
dynamic resource allocation to parallel queues subject to _time-_
_varying link conditions_ and _inhomogeneous switching delays_

[1]. The central challenge is to design a scheduling policy
that is both channel-aware (accounting for link conditions)
and switch-aware (accounting for switching delays) to ensure
system stability and maximize throughput. Existing paradigms,
however, often idealize away these difficulties, leaving a gap
between theory and the reality of mobile or directional platforms. This work addresses that gap by formalizing a singleserver, parallel-queue model that incorporates random, pairdependent switching delays and time-varying channels. Within
this setting, our goal is to develop scheduling policies that
balance instantaneous rate against switching delays. To ground
this abstract problem, we introduce a practical example from
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted FSO communication
that exhibits these exact dynamics.
Consider a two-hop UAV-assisted wireless network with an
FSO backhaul, comprising a ground station, one _master_ UAV,
and multiple _slave_ UAVs (see fig. 1). In this system, the ground
station points an optical beam to the master drone, which acts
as a relay, actively steering the beam to a single chosen slave

per time-slot. This physical setup directly gives rise to the two
central challenges of our model.
First, the link quality is inconsistent. The combination of
atmospheric dynamics, platform mobility, and potential blockages—compounded by the mechanical limitations of steering
and the slaves’ finite receiver Field of View (FOV)—induces
the time-varying channel conditions. Second, switching between slaves is not instantaneous. The handover process requires coarse steering with a _gimbal mirror_ and fine alignment
with a _Fast Steering Mirror_ (FSM), resulting in a delay whose
duration depends on the slaves’ angular separation [2]. This
mechanical process is the physical source of the stochastic
and inhomogeneous switching delays. This example faithfully



Fig. 1: System model


manifests the structural features of the abstract problem:
time-varyting connectivity (stemming from alignment, FOV,
and blockage) and inhomogeneous switching (stemming from
steering and acquisition). Additionally, the constraint of a
single active link makes the choice of scheduling policy important, as it directly dictates network stability and throughput.
Building on this motivation, our contributions are as follows: We (i) provide a concrete system-to-model instantiation
that captures the twin challenges of dynamically allocating resources to parallel queues with time-varying connectivity and
inhomogeneous switching; (ii) characterize the FSO channel
variability and switching statistics induced by actuator dynamics, alignment, and FOV constraints; (iii) we propose and
analyze scheduling policies that adapt jointly to channel and
switching dynamics and prove throughput optimality—i.e.,
stabilization of any arrival rate vector strictly within the
capacity region under standard ergodicity and finite-moment
assumptions; and (iv) validate our approach with simulations.








II. RELATED WORK


The problem of dynamic server allocation to parallel queues
is foundationally addressed by the Max-Weight (MW) algorithm, which is proven to be throughput-optimal when server
switching is instantaneous and cost-free [3]. However, in many
practical systems, switching server incurs significant time delays. The introduction of such switchover times fundamentally
alters the problem, shrinking the stability region and rendering
the myopic MW policy sub-optimal, and potentially unstable

[4]. Subsequent research has developed switch-overhead-aware
policies to address this. One major approach is to amortize
the switching cost by committing to a service decision for
an extended period. This includes frame-based policies like
the FBDC algorithm, which regains asymptotic optimality
for fixed switchover delays by using long service dwells

[4], and two-timescale policies that separate slow base-station
activation from fast user scheduling in wireless networks [5],

[6]. A second approach uses hysteresis to suppress inefficient
flapping, where the scheduler waits for a state-dependent
backlog threshold to be crossed before initiating a switch [7].
These seminal works provide robust solutions but predominantly model switching as a deterministic, uniform delay or
an abstract cost penalty therefore they do not fit the scenario
in section I, where switching times are state-dependent and
stochastic. Our methodology addresses this gap by directly
integrating these state-dependent, stochastic switching times
into a Lyapunov-based scheduling policy, thereby creating
a model that is better aligned with the realities of queuing
systems.


III. SYSTEM MODEL


_A. Queueing Formulation_


We study an **M/G/1** queuing system with one server and
_|N|_ parallel queues, each with Markovian arrivals and general
service times. Time is slotted into _T_ intervals of length ∆ _t_,
indexed by _t_ ; in each slot the server serves at most one
queue. Switching from queue _i_ to _j_ incurs a switching of
_τij ∈_ Z [+] slots. Let _Qi_ ( _t_ ) denote the backlog of queue _i_
at the start of slot _t_, with Poisson arrivals _Ai_ ( _t_ ) of rate _λi_
and infinite buffers. The server–queue assignment is given by
_ai_ ( _t_ ) _∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ (1 = scheduled), subject to [�] _i∈N_ _[a][i]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [1]

for all _t_ . Server unavailability (due to switching or other
outages) is represented by _b_ ( _t_ ) _∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ ( _b_ ( _t_ ) = 1 means
unavailable), and service eligibility is _ei_ ( _t_ ) = _ai_ ( _t_ ) (1 _−_ _b_ ( _t_ )).
The instantaneous channel rate of queue _i_ in slot _t_ is _Ri_ ( _t_ ),
yielding effective per-slot capacity _µi_ ( _t_ ) = min _{µ, R_ ¯ _i_ ( _t_ ) _}_,
where ¯ _µ_ is the system throughput cap. Departures and backlog
evolve as:


_Di_ ( _t_ ) =   - _Qi_ ( _t_ ) _∧_ _µi_ ( _t_ )� _ei_ ( _t_ ) _,_ (1)

_Qi_ ( _t_ + 1) =  - _Qi_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _Di_ ( _t_ )�+ + _Ai_ ( _t_ ) _,_ _Qi_ (0) = 0 (2)


with _x ∧_ _y_ = min _{x, y}_ and ( _x_ ) [+] = max _{x,_ 0 _}_ . We model
switching delays, _τij_ ( _t_ ), as _dependent random variables_ because, in practice, the time required to switch is not an isolated
event. It’s influenced by the specific source and destination



The visit lengths _vi_ are determined by the load and the chosen
scheduling policy. With the preceding queueing formulation
and switching-time models, a beam-steered FSO backhaul for
a multi-UAV network aligns naturally: per-slot link rates _Ri_ ( _t_ )
are supplied by the FSO link, while pairwise switching times
_τij_ ( _t_ ) capture beam steering, acquisition, and handover. In the
next section we specify the FSO layer that generates _Ri_ ( _t_ )
and _τij_ ( _t_ )—including the rate–SNR mapping, and the (timevarying, heterogeneous) switching delays—and couple it to the
queuing system above.


_B. Network Architecture & FSO Channel Characteristics_


The network in fig. 1 comprises a stationary ground station,
a fixed master UAV acting as a reflective relay, and _|N|_ slave
UAVs arranged in a large hexagonal pattern. Each slave loiters
on a short circular path around its formation point to emulate
continuous motion. The end-to-end (E2E) optical gain from



queues as well as recent switching activity. This approach
is superior to modeling the delays as _independent random_
_variables_ because it correctly captures how a scheduling
policy’s choices impact future switching costs. While simpler,
the independent model ignores this.
A scheduling policy _π_ selects the next target queue at slot
boundaries from the system state:


_S_ ( _t_ ) =   - [ _Qi_ ( _t_ )] _i∈N,_ [ _Ri_ ( _t_ )] _i∈N,_ [ _τij_ ( _t_ )] _i_ = _j_   - (3)


which includes current backlogs, instantaneous channel rates,
and pairwise switching delays. The policy induces per-slot
decisions ( _ai_ ( _t_ ) _, b_ ( _t_ )); when switching from _i_ to _j_, it sets
_b_ ( _t_ ) = 1 for _τij_ ( _t_ ) consecutive slots (so _ei_ ( _t_ ) = 0 for all
_i_ ), after which scheduling resumes with _aj_ ( _t_ ) = 1.
Under a fixed policy with long-run switching frequencies
_pij_ (moves _i_ _→_ _j_ ) and average visit lengths _vi_, the fraction of
slots lost to switching/outages is:







_ϕ_ sw =




  - _i_ = _j_ _[p][ij]_ _[τ]_ [¯] _[ij]_

~~�~~ _N_
_k_ =1 _[v][k]_ [ +] ~~[ �]~~ _i_ = _j_



(4)
_i_ = _j_ _[p][ij]_ [ ¯] _[τ][ij]_



so the usable fraction of time is 1 _−_ _ϕ_ sw. Each queue _i_ delivers
average per-slot service _ri_ = E[ _µi_ ( _t_ )] when connected and is
scheduled in a fraction _αi_ of the usable slots; its effective
allocation over all slots is:


_φi_ = (1 _−_ _ϕ_ sw) _αi_ (5)

Over a propagation range _Z_, large-scale attenuation is _hℓ_ =

and controls fading severity via the log-amplitude variance _V_ .

where _k_ is the optical wave number, and _Cn_ [2][(] _[h]_ [)][ and] _[ v]_ [(] _[h]_ [)][ are]
the refractive index and wind speed profiles. As the coherence
time of atmospheric effects ( _t_ 0 _≈_ 10 ms) is much shorter than
that of mechanical platform jitter, turbulence is the dominant
factor driving rapid channel fluctuations. This justifies a **block-**
**fading model**, where the channel gain is assumed to be
constant over a slot duration ∆ _t_ on the order of _t_ 0.


_C. Stochastic Switching Time Model_


Switching the optical beam from a serving slave _i_ to a target
slave _j_ is not instantaneous. The total switching time _Tij_ ( _t_ )
is a random variable to account for mechanical, electronic,
and probabilistic effects. In our example scenario, this time
accounts for the sum of the time to re-point the gimbal and
FSM and the total time for all link acquisition attempts:



Here, _a_ is the receiving aperture radius and _wz_ is the gaussian
beam radius and _ν_ represents the ratio of the receiver’s
aperture size to the size of the incoming FSO beam. Hop 1
(ground _→_ master) is static, with Rayleigh radial error _r_ 1( _t_ )
and per-axis jitter variance _σpg_ [2] [=] _[ σ]_ _p_ [2] 1 [+] _[ σ]_ _g_ [2] [from the ground]
transmitter and the master platform. Hop 2 (master _→_ slave) is
dynamic; the total error combines lateral displacement ( _δ_ lat( _t_ ))
and angular deviation ( _θ_ ang( _t_ )) scaled by the instantaneous
range _Z_ 2 _,i_ ( _t_ ):


_r_ 2 _,i_ ( _t_ ) = _δ_ lat( _t_ ) + _Z_ 2 _,i_ ( _t_ ) _θ_ ang( _t_ ) (13)

Cov[ _δ_ lat( _t_ )] = ( _σp_ [2] 1 [+] _[ σ]_ _p_ [2] 2 [)] _[ I]_ [2] (14)

Cov[ _θ_ ang( _t_ )] = �4 _σθ,m_ [2] [+] _[ σ]_ _θ,_ [2] 2 [+] _[ σ]_ turb [2]     - _I_ 2 (15)


where mirror jitter at the master enters doubled in angle (factor
2; variance factor 4). A hard FOV gate applies: the hop gain
is zero if _∥_ **r** 2 _,i_ ( _t_ ) _∥_ _> Z_ 2 _,i_ ( _t_ ) _θ_ FOV. Table I summarizes hopspecific quantities.

The distribution of the E2E gain _Hi_ ( _t_ ) lacks a closed form
due to the product structure and the nonlinear FOV truncation.
It is therefore estimated via Monte Carlo simulation of the
constituent terms, and the outage probability follows as:


              - _h_ th
_P_ out( _h_ th) = Pr[ _Hi_ ( _t_ ) _< h_ th] = _fHi_ ( _h_ ) _dh,_ (16)

∆ _t_




(20)



The first term, _T_ slew, is the deterministic mechanical slew time.
It is governed by a trapezoidal S-curve velocity profile based
on the angular separation _θij_ and the gimbal’s dynamic limits
on maximum velocity ( _v_ max), acceleration ( _a_ max), and jerk
( _j_ max):



_T_ slew( _θij_ ) = _[θ][ij]_




_[θ][ij]_ + _[v]_ [max]

_v_ max _a_ max




_[v]_ [max] + [4] _[a]_ [max]

_a_ max _j_ max



(21)
_j_ max



The second term in eq. (20) contains the fixed overhead for a
single acquisition attempt, _T_ acq = _t_ fsm + _t_ pilot, which includes
fine-pointing FSM settling and pilot signal exchange. The
total time to establish a link is the number of attempts, _K_,
multiplied by the fixed duration of a single attempt, _T_ acq.
We model _K_ as a **geometrically distributed** random variable
where the success probability, _pi_ ( _t_ ), is dynamic, depending on
factors like link distance and pointing accuracy. This model
accounts for both **stochastic failures**, where multiple attempts
( _K >_ 1) increase the delay, and **geometric rejections**, where a
link is physically impossible ( _pi_ ( _t_ ) = 0). Since this underlying
success probability changes over time, the resulting sequence
of switching delays is **temporally correlated** .


IV. SCHEDULING APPROACHES


We begin by recalling the classical MW policy. MW is provably throughput-optimal when switching costs are absent [3];
we therefore treat it as a comparison case that captures the best
achievable performance in an idealized, no-cost setting. Real
systems, however, face inhomogeneous switching delays that
MW ignores. To address this gap, we introduce our **Adaptive**
**Channel and switch-aware Index (ACI)** scheduler, which
is explicitly designed for settings with stochastic switching
delays. We prove that ACI remains throughput-optimal and
then develop variations to optimize additional performance
objectives under these realistic costs.


_A. The Max-Weight Algorithm: A Theoretical Benchmark_


The classical MW policy is throughput-optimal for parallel
queues _when switching costs are zero_ . In our discrete-time
model (Sec. III-A), a single server serves queue _i ∈N_ with
backlog _Qi_ ( _t_ ) and instantaneous service rates _µi_ ( _t_ ) when
connected. At each slot _t_, MW selects:



_i_ _[∗]_ ( _t_ ) _∈_ argmax
_i∈N_




- _Qi_ ( _t_ ) _· µi_ ( _t_ ) _·_ ∆ _t_ - (22)



expectation. We use the current rate _Ri_ ( _t_ ) as a forecast for
the entire dwell:


_B_ ˆ _i_ ( _t_ ; _L_ ) _≈_ _L · Ri_ ( _t_ ) _·_ (∆ _t −_ _tp_ ) [+] (25)


To add robustness, ACI supports _early halt_ . Service on the
current queue may end before the frame completes when any
of the following holds: (i) the queue drains; (ii) the channel
is in persistent outage; (iii) the realized rate falls consistently
below the forecast used in eq. (25); or (iv) another queue’s
score in eq. (23) grows sufficiently larger than the current one.
Because the score is continuously recalculated, the scheduler
can preempt frames when these conditions hold. The amortized
goodput is then the initially-estimated total bits, divided by the
total time investment (switching time _τij_ ( _t_ ) and the planned
dwell _L ·_ ∆ _t_ ):


_B_ ˆ _i_ ( _t_ ; _L_ )
_µ_ ¯ _i|j_ ( _t_ ) = _τij_ ( _t_ ) + _L ·_ ∆ _t_ (26)


Finally, ACI provides explicit control via a **Switching Mod-**
**ulator**, _fij_ ( _t_ ), which is central to the scheduling decision and
is defined as:



_fij_ ( _t_ ) ≜ [1 +] _[ γ][ ·][ χ][ij]_ [(] _[t]_ [)]



This balances backlog and rate and, in the zero-cost case,
stabilizes any arrival vector Λ within the capacity region
_C_ . Because MW ignores switching delays, applying it with
heterogeneous switching delays can trigger frequent handovers
and waste service time. This motivates our ACI scheduler
developed next.


_B. The ACI Scheduling Framework_


ACI departs from MW in two ways: (i) it accounts for
switching delays in the decision rule, and (ii) it commits to
frames of length _L_ instead of single-slot decisions. Frames
both amortize the switching delay over _L_ slots and let nonserved queues accumulate arrivals (increasing their weights),
and reduces oscillations between queues. A switch occurs only
when its expected service gain exceeds the switching delay.
At each decision point ACI selects queue _i_ _[∗]_ that maximizes a
generalized score:



(27)
1 + _β · τij_ ( _t_ )



This term combines a bonus for _transition affinity_, _χij_ ( _t_ ) _∈_

[0 _,_ 1], with a penalty for the switching duration in slots,
_τij_ ( _t_ ). Transition affinity is a normalized metric that quantifies
the efficiency of switching from queue _i_ to _j_, based on
the system’s physical or logical structure. For instance, in a
network of mobile UAVs where proximity reduces switching
time, affinity is physical adjacency. Alternatively, in a system
where queues rely on shared software modules, affinity is
the degree of resource overlap. The trade-off between these
factors is controlled by _γ, β ≥_ 0: increasing _γ_ prioritizes highaffinity switches, while increasing _β_ more heavily penalizes
the raw duration to favor faster switchings. For our subsequent
optimality proof, we establish its bounds. Given a maximum
possible switching duration _τ_ max, the modulator is bounded,
where _f_ max = 1 + _γ_ and _f_ min = 1+ _βτ_ 1 max [.]


_C. Throughput Optimality of the ACI Scheduler_


We prove that ACI is throughput-optimal by showing that
the network queues are stable for any arrival rate vector
within a scaled version of the capacity region. The proof uses
Lyapunov criterion, which requires showing that the system
state is pushed towards a smaller-congestion region when it
becomes large. To formalize this, we first establish a bound
on the one-slot drift of a quadratic Lyapunov function, defined
as a measure of total network congestion:



_i_ _[∗]_ ( _t_ ) = argmax
_i∈N_




- _Qi_ ( _t_ ) _·_ ¯ _µi|j_ ( _t_ ) _· fij_ ( _t_ ) (23)



The score is a product of three components. _Qi_ ( _t_ ) is the
backlog of slave _i_ at time _t_ . ¯ _µi|j_ ( _t_ ) is the amortized goodput.
Ideally, this would be based on the true expected goodput in
bits over the frame, _Bi_ ( _t_ ; _L_ ), which requires integrating over
future channel rates:



_L_ ( _Q_ ( _t_ )) ≜ [1]

_N_

- _Q_ [2] _i_ [(] _[t]_ [)] (28)

_i_ =1



_Bi_ ( _t_ ; _L_ ) ≜



_L−_ 1

- _Ri_ ( _t_ + _ℓ_ ∆ _t_ ) _·_ (∆ _t −_ _tp_ ) [+] (24)


_ℓ_ =0



Here, ∆ _t_ is the slot duration and _tp ∈_ [0 _,_ ∆ _t_ ) is the per-slot
processing overhead), so only (∆ _t −_ _tp_ ) [+] seconds per slot
are usable. Since future rates _Ri_ ( _t_ + _ℓ_ ∆ _t_ ) are unknown at the
decision time _t_, a practical scheduler must approximate this



The one-slot drift, ∆( _t_ ), is its expected change over a single
time slot, conditioned on the current state:


∆( _t_ ) ≜ E� _L_ ( _Q_ ( _t_ + 1)) _−_ _L_ ( _Q_ ( _t_ )) �� _Q_ ( _t_ )� (29)


We derive a bound on this drift by analyzing the change in a
single queue’s squared backlog. For conciseness, we drop the
time and queue indices, letting _Qi_ ( _t_ + 1) = _Q_ [+], _Qi_ ( _t_ ) = _Q_,
_Ai_ ( _t_ ) = _A_, _Di_ ( _t_ ) = _D_, and the remaining backlog be _U_ =

[ _Q −_ _D_ ] [+] . The derivation begins from the queueing dynamic
_Q_ [+] = _U_ + _A_ :


( _Q_ [+] ) [2] = ( _U_ + _A_ ) [2] = _U_ [2] + _A_ [2] + 2 _AU_ (30)


We can upper-bound this expression by applying two inequalities. First, since the remaining backlog _U_ = [ _Q_ _−_ _D_ ] [+] cannot
exceed the current queue size, we have _U ≤_ _Q_ . Second,
because the square of the positive part of a number is no larger
than the square of the number itself, it implies _U_ [2] _≤_ ( _Q−D_ ) [2] .
Applying these bounds yields:


( _Q_ [+] ) [2] _≤_ ( _Q −_ _D_ ) [2] + _A_ [2] + 2 _AQ_

= _Q_ [2] _−_ 2 _QD_ + _D_ [2] + _A_ [2] + 2 _AQ_ (31)


Rearranging this expression gives the bound on the per-queue
change:


( _Q_ [+] ) [2] _−_ _Q_ [2] _≤_ _A_ [2] + _D_ [2] + 2 _Q_ ( _A −_ _D_ ) (32)


Substituting this result back into the definition of the drift from
eq. (29) and restoring the indices yields the final bound:



We substitute the expansion of _Qi_ ( _t_ ) from eq. (36) into the
cross-term. Distributing the _δi_ ( _t_ ) term and factoring out the
constant _Qi_ ( _tk_ ) separates the expression into three distinct
components: a frame-start term and two remainder terms,
which we define as _Ri_ _[δδ]_ and _Ri_ _[δη]_ [:]











_Qi_ ( _t_ ) _δi_ ( _t_ ) = _Qi_ ( _tk_ )

The remainder terms can now be bounded. We analyze each
term separately. The term _Ri_ _[δδ]_ is a sum over ordered pairs. It
can be expressed exactly using the identity relating it to the
square of the sum over the frame:

To analyze the system over service frames, we extend the oneslot drift bound. We hereafter let [�] _t_ [denote the sum over all]
slots in frame _k_, i.e., [�] _t_ _[t][k]_ = [+1] _tk_ _[−]_ [1] . Summing eq. (33) over a frame
of length _Fk_ = _tk_ +1 _−_ _tk_ gives:



Finally, using the inequality ( _a −_ _b_ ) [2] _≤_ 2( _a_ [2] + _b_ [2] ), we have
_δi_ ( _t_ ) [2] = ( _Ai_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _Di_ ( _t_ )) [2] _≤_ 2( _Ai_ ( _t_ ) [2] + _Di_ ( _t_ ) [2] ). Substituting
this yields a bound in terms of second moments:

The main challenge is to bound the cross-term involving _Qi_ ( _t_ ),
as it evolves within the frame. To do this, we first linearize
the queueing dynamic.
Let the net input be _δi_ ( _t_ ) ≜ _Ai_ ( _t_ ) _−Di_ ( _t_ ), and define a nonnegative slack variable _ηi_ ( _t_ ) ≜ ( _Di_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _Qi_ ( _t_ )) [+] to capture
the effect of the non-negativity constraint. This rewrites the
queueing dynamic in a linear form:


_Qi_ ( _t_ + 1) = _Qi_ ( _t_ ) + _δi_ ( _t_ ) + _ηi_ ( _t_ ) (35)


Crucially, the slack is bounded by the service, _ηi_ ( _t_ ) _≤_ _Di_ ( _t_ ).
By unrolling the recursion, we express _Qi_ ( _t_ ) in terms of the
queue state at the start of the frame, _Qi_ ( _tk_ ):



We start by taking the absolute value of _Ri_ _[δη]_ and applying the
triangle inequality. Since _ηi_ ( _u_ ) _≥_ 0, the cumulative sum is
non-negative and bounded by the total sum over the frame:

Next, we replace the terms with their upper bounds: _ηi_ ( _u_ ) _≤_
_Di_ ( _u_ ) and _|δi_ ( _t_ ) _|_ = _|Ai_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _Di_ ( _t_ ) _| ≤_ _Ai_ ( _t_ ) + _Di_ ( _t_ ). This

where the second step again uses ( _a_ + _b_ ) [2] _≤_ 2( _a_ [2] + _b_ [2] ). Finally,
using the inequality _xy ≤_ 2 [1] [(] _[x]_ [2][ +] _[ y]_ [2][)][ on the two square-root]

terms, we arrive at a linear bound:



where the constant _B_ absorbs _C_ and the expected second
moments of the arrival and departure processes, which are
assumed to be bounded. By collecting all second-moment
disturbance terms into a single constant and expressing the
net change in terms of system parameters, we arrive at the

for some constant _c_ 1 _>_ 0. Combining the bounds from eq. (40)
and eq. (44) confirms that the sum of the remainders is
bounded as stated. The remainder terms can now be bounded.
They are found to be proportional to the frame length and
second moments of arrivals and departures:



Here, _B_ is a finite constant independent of the control policy,
_λi_ is the arrival rate for queue _i_, ∆ _t_ is the time-slot duration,
and _µi_ ( _k_ ) ≜ [�] _t_ _[D][i]_ [(] _[t]_ [)][ is the total service delivered to queue]

_i_ during frame _k_ .
We now outline the proof that ACI is throughput-optimal.
The proof depends on showing that for any arrival rate vector
Λ strictly within a scaled version of the capacity region, the
Lyapunov drift is negative.
_1) Constant-Factor Approximation Lemma:_ The ACI rule
from eq. (23) maximizes a score that includes the switching
modulator _fij_ ( _t_ ). Let the unscaled, per-unit-time goodput
objective be:

We now assemble the final bound by substituting our results
back into the frame sum eq. (34). First, we replace the crossterm [�] _t_ _[Q][i]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[δ][i]_ [(] _[t]_ [)][ with its decomposition from eq. (37).]

Next, we replace the remainder terms _Ri_ _[δδ]_ and _Ri_ _[δη]_ with their
respective upper bounds from eq. (40) and eq. (44). Since we
seek an upper bound, we use _Ri_ _[δδ]_ [+] _[R]_ _i_ _[δη]_ _≤|Ri_ _[δδ][|]_ [+] _[|][R]_ _i_ _[δη][|]_ [. This]
allows us to collect all terms related to the second moments

The ACI policy selects ( _i_ _[∗]_ _, L_ _[∗]_ ) to maximize the scaled objective _H_ ( _i, L_ ) ≜ _G_ ( _i, L_ ) _· fij_ ( _tk_ ). Because the modulator
is bounded such that _fij ∈_ [ _f_ min _, f_ max], the chosen action
( _i_ _[∗]_ _, L_ _[∗]_ ) is guaranteed to achieve at least a constant fraction
_ζ_ ≜ _f_ min _/f_ max of the maximum possible unscaled objective.


_G_ ( _i_ _[∗]_ _, L_ _[∗]_ _| tk_ ) _≥_ _ζ ·_ max (51)
_i,L_ _[G]_ [(] _[i, L][ |][ t][k]_ [)]


This holds because _G_ ( _i_ _[∗]_ _, L_ _[∗]_ ) _fi∗j ≥G_ ( [ˆ] _i,_ _L_ [ˆ] ) _f_ ˆ _ij_, where ( [ˆ] _i,_ _L_ [ˆ] )
maximizes _G_ . Rearranging and using the bounds on _f_ proves
the lemma.
_2) Frame Drift Inequality and Negative Drift:_ We begin
with the frame-drift bound from eq. (49). By identifying
E[ _µi∗_ ( _k_ ) _| Q_ ( _tk_ )] as the service provided by ACI and dividing
by the expected frame duration E[∆ _t · Fk | Q_ ( _tk_ )], we can
relate the drift to the ACI objective:



_N_





- _Qi_ ( _tk_ ) _λi −G_ ( _i_ _[∗]_ _, L_ _[∗]_ _| Q_ ( _tk_ ))


_i_ =1



for some positive constant _C_ . The second line collects the
initial term from eq. (46) and the bounds on the remainders
into a single expression that is linear in the frame length _Fk_
and the second moments. Finally, we take the conditional
expectation of both sides with respect to _Q_ ( _tk_ ). Let _δ_ [¯] _i,k_ ≜



∆ _k_
E[∆ _t · Fk | Q_ ( _tk_ )] _[≤]_ _[B][′]_ [ +]



(52)
Applying the lemma from eq. (51), we can lower-bound
the service term by what an optimal stationary policy could


achieve. For any target rate vector ¯ _**µ**_ _∈C_, there exists a policy
that yields an objective value of [�] _i_ _[Q][i]_ [(] _[t][k]_ [)¯] _[µ][i]_ [. Therefore:]

Fig. 2: Capacity region: with switching ( _ζC_ ) vs without ( _C_ )


Now, consider a stabilizable system where queue _i ̸_ = _j_
has a persistent arrival rate _λi >_ 0. If the scheduler were
to repeatedly decide to stay on queue _i_, queue _j_ would
receive no service. Consequently, its backlog _Qi_ ( _t_ ) would
grow, on average, with every passing frame. By the law of
large numbers, the backlog _Qi_ ( _t_ ) is guaranteed to eventually
cross the finite threshold Θ _ij_ ( _L_ ) for any potential dwell _L_ .
At that point, the ACI rule _must_ select a switch to queue _j_
to maximize its score. This proves that ACI cannot indefinitely
ignore a queue with incoming data, guaranteeing that no queue
is starved and that switches are inevitable in a live system.


_E. ACI Urgency Metric Variations_


ACI is flexible, so the backlog term _Qi_ ( _t_ ) can be replaced
by Head-of-Line (HoL) age to target latency. We consider
two variants, **ACI-A (Age-Aware)** with score Age _i ·_ ¯ _µi|j_
and **ACI-PA (Pure-Age)** with score Age _i_ only. These variants can reduce latency, yet they are not guaranteed to be
throughput-optimal. The backlog-driven ACI is throughputoptimal because the decision weight _Qi_ ( _t_ ) aligns with the
Lyapunov _L_ ( _Q_ ) = [1] - _[Q]_ [2] [and ensures negative drift under]



For the drift to be negative for large queue lengths, the term in
the parenthesis must be positive. This requires that the arrival
rate vector Λ lies strictly inside the _ζ_ -scaled capacity region,
_ζC_ . Specifically, for some _α >_ 0, we need a feasible service
vector ¯ _**µ**_ _∈C_ such that:


_ζ_ ¯ _µi ≥_ _λi_ + _α_ for all _i_ (54)


Under this condition, the drift becomes negative for sufficiently large [�] _i_ _[Q][i]_ [(] _[t][k]_ [)][, which guarantees network stability]

by the Lyapunov criterion. The negative drift condition proves
that the ACI policy stabilizes any arrival rate vector Λ within
the interior of the scaled capacity region _ζC_ . This establishes
the throughput optimality of the ACI framework. Figure 2
shows how switching delays shrink the ideal capacity region
_C_ . Since ACI avoids costly switches unless necessary, its
operating region for any stabilizable load Λ lies between these
two boundaries.


_D. Guaranteed Switching and Starvation Avoidance_

A key property of ACI is that it avoids starving any queue
with persistent arrivals. We prove this by showing that if the
algorithm stays on a single queue _i_ for too long, the score for
switching to another queue _j_ will inevitably become dominant,
forcing a switch. At a decision epoch _tk_, let the currently
served queue be _i_ . The ACI algorithm compares the score of
staying on queue _i_ versus switching to any other queue _j ̸_ = _i_ .
To analyze this trade-off, we can simplify the ACI score from
eq. (23) to isolate the core components.
The score for **staying** on queue _i_ (where the switching time
_τii_ = 0) is proportional to its queue-weighted rate:


Scorestay( _i_ ) _∝_ _Qi_ ( _tk_ ) _·_ E[ _Ri_ ] _· fii_ ( _tk_ ) (55)


The score for **switching** to queue _j_ for a dwell of _L_ slots must
account for the initial switching delay _τij_, which amortizes the
goodput:


_L ·_ ∆ _t_
Scoreswitch( _j, L_ ) _∝_ _Qj_ ( _tk_ ) _·_ E[ _Rj_ ] _·_
_τij_ ( _tk_ ) + _L ·_ ∆ _t_ _[·][ f][ij]_ [(] _[t][k]_ [)]

(56)
A switch to ( _j, L_ ) is guaranteed if Scoreswitch( _j, L_ ) _>_
Scorestay( _i_ ). Rearranging this inequality shows that a switch
is forced whenever the backlog _Qi_ ( _tk_ ) exceeds a specific
threshold Θ _ij_ ( _L_ ):




[1]

(57)



Lyapunov _L_ ( _Q_ ) = [1] 2 - _i_ _[Q]_ _i_ [2] [and ensures negative drift under]

stabilizable load. When backlog is replaced by HoL this
alignment disappears, the scheduler may serve a very old
packet on a near-zero-rate channel, negative drift is no longer
guaranteed, and other queues can grow without bound at high
load.

As shown in Figure 3, the E2E gain is heavily skewed

Crucially, this threshold is finite for any queue _i_ with a nonzero expected rate (E[ _Ri_ ] _>_ 0). The threshold is lowest for a
long dwell ( _L →∞_ ), but it remains finite even for the smallest
possible dwell, _L_ = 1.

gain exceeds the penalty. As a result, ACI(Dependent) converts
about 90% of time into service, while ACI(FSO) remains
service-dominant but lower at 75–80% because acquisition
retries and FOV misses add overhead. The Dependent–FSO
gap is the tax of stochastic acquisition failures beyond pure
kinematics.

Fig. 4: Slave UAV mobility and switching dynamics


To isolate how switching-time uncertainty shapes performance, we hold arrivals, slotting, horizon, and per-slot
rates fixed and compare three switch-time models. In the
_IID_ case, switch times fluctuate around ring-distance means
(near/mid/far) with no memory—think “roughly the same cost
every time.” The _dependent_ case introduces AR(1)-type drift
at two levels (global and per-target), so the system experiences
recognizable fast/slow phases—bursts of cheap or expensive
switches that persist for a while. The _FSO-driven_ case mirrors that correlated behavior but adds the realities of optics:
geometric FOV misses and probabilistic acquisition retries.
Crucially, Figure 5 reports _packet-delivery delay_, not switching
time; switching costs affect it _indirectly_ by interrupting service
and changing when the scheduler chooses to dwell or move.
Consistent with this, ACI(FSO) tracks ACI(Dependent) across
most quantiles and then separates in the upper tail due to
retries and FOV rejections; ACI(IID) is similar near the median
and lightest-tailed because it lacks bursts and failures. The
age-prioritizing variants compress the tail: ACI-A (channelaware age) and ACI-PA (pure age) nearly overlap, with ACI-A
slightly left-shifted from better tie-breaking when rates differ.


The time budget in Figure 6 shows the mechanism. A
switching-blind Max-Weight chases instantaneous rates, retargets often, and pays a full slew–pilot–settle cycle each time,
so wall-clock time is spent switching and service collapses
to about 1%. ACI prices switches, rewards adjacency, and
commits in short frames, banking dwell until the expected

VI. SUMMARY


We address the problem of dynamic server allocation to
parallel queues with stochastic, inhomogeneous switch costs
and time-varying connectivity, a problem motivated by FSO









Fig. 6: Fraction of time spent serving vs. switching


To understand each ACI element, we use mean delay as the
improvement metric. Figure 7 shows that removing adjacency
(longer slews) or the switch penalty (flapping from repeated
slew–pilot–settle cycles) raises delay, while the full policy
attains the lowest mean delay—evidence that both proximity
cues and explicit switch-time pricing are necessary.






backhaul in multi-UAV networks. To overcome the inefficiency
of the myopic Max-Weight policy, we propose ACI, a nonmyopic, frame-based framework to amortize these switching
delays. We prove the backlog-driven ACI is throughputoptimal for a scaled capacity region. Further analysis shows
that age-based variants provide superior latency, which reveals
a clear performance trade-off: the standard ACI is ideal for
maximum throughput, while the channel-aware ACI-A offers
the best balance for latency-sensitive applications.
