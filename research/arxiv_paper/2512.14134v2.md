**Abstract**


Chae and Kang (2019, _Pacific-Basin Finance Journal_ ) documented a puzzling Low Volume Return Premium (LVRP) in Korea—contradicting global
High Volume Return Premium (HVRP) evidence. We resolve this puzzle.
Using Korean market data (2020-2024), we demonstrate that HVRP exists
in Korea but is masked by (1) pooling heterogeneous investor types and (2)
using inappropriate intensity normalization. When institutional buying intensity is normalized by market capitalization rather than trading value, a
perfect monotonic relationship emerges: highest-conviction institutional buying (Q4) generates +12.12% cumulative abnormal returns over 50 days, while
lowest-intensity trades (Q1) yield modest returns (+4.65%). Retail investors
exhibit a flat pattern—their trading generates near-zero returns regardless
of conviction level—confirming the pure noise trader hypothesis. During the
Donghak Ant Movement (2020-2021), however, coordinated retail investors
temporarily transformed from noise traders to liquidity providers, generating
returns comparable to institutional trading. Our findings reconcile conflicting international evidence and demonstrate that detecting informed trading signals requires investor-type decomposition, nonlinear quartile analysis,
and conviction-based (market cap) rather than participation-based (trading
value) measurement.

**1. Introduction**


**The Korean Market Puzzle.** In 2019, this journal published a striking finding that challenged two decades of global evidence on volume-return
relationships. Chae and Kang (2019) documented a _Low_ Volume Return Premium (LVRP) in Korea—the opposite of the High Volume Return Premium
(HVRP) established by Gervais et al. (2001) for U.S. markets and replicated
globally by Kaniel et al. (2012). Of 70 sample configurations examined, Chae
and Kang found 16 showing significant LVRP versus only 1 showing significant HVRP. This “Korean Puzzle” created a fundamental contradiction: why
would volume-return dynamics in one of Asia’s most developed capital markets operate in reverse?
**Our Resolution.** We resolve this puzzle. The apparent LVRP in Korea
stems not from unique market dynamics but from two measurement artifacts:
(1) pooling heterogeneous investor types whose effects offset each other, and
(2) using trading value normalization that conflates informed conviction with
noise participation. When we decompose events by investor identity and
normalize intensity by market capitalization, the HVRP emerges clearly—
but only for informed investors.
The theoretical foundations for HVRP are well-established. Gervais et al.
(2001)’s core mechanism is rooted in behavioral finance: investors with ’limited attention’ respond to ’attention shocks’ from volume spikes, creating new
buying demand. This aligns with Merton et al. (1987)’s ’investor recognition
hypothesis,’ which posits that increased stock visibility reduces the cost of
capital.
In the Korean market, An et al. (2006) initially verified the HVRP phenomenon using 2001-2003 KOSPI data, finding stronger effects in large-cap
firms. They _surmised_ that this difference “may originate from differences in
the main investor composition of the two groups, namely institutional versus individual investors.” However, due to data limitations at the time, this
’investor type hypothesis’ remained an _untested hypothesis_ . Our study provides the first empirical test of this conjecture, addressing both the original
research gap and the subsequent puzzle created by Chae and Kang (2019).
Testing this ’investor type hypothesis’ has profound academic significance
beyond merely filling a 20-year-old domestic research gap—it provides contemporary evidence for a core and longstanding debate in finance: “What


2


role do retail investors play in the market?”


  - **The ’Noise Trader’ Camp:** Led by Barber and Odean (2007), this
group argues that retail investors are ’noise traders’ who overreact to
attention-grabbing stocks rather than conducting professional analysis.
Recent NBER research by BARBER et al. (2022) demonstrates that
net purchases by new retail investors significantly _negatively_ predict
future returns, confirming their ’poor stock selection’ ability.


  - **The ’Informed Trader’ Camp:** Conversely, KANIEL et al. (2008),
Kaniel et al. (2012), and BOEHMER et al. (2021) argue that retail
investors are rational traders who provide liquidity to institutions or
act on information, with their net purchases _positively_ predicting future
returns.


Approximately 20 years after An et al. (2006)’s study, modern markets
have undergone two major structural changes. First, the COVID-19 pandemic (Baker et al., 2020) caused unprecedented market volatility. During
this period, retail investor trading through fintech platforms exploded, with
these investors serving as ’liquidity providers’ absorbing institutional selling
pressure, as Ozik et al. (2021) documented. This provides new impetus for
reinterpreting the drivers of HVRP. Second, the ’Donghak Ant Movement’
(Jung and Kim, 2021) parallels the ’Meme Stock’ phenomenon in U.S. markets. Bradley et al. (2023) showed that Reddit’s WallStreetBets community
possessed significant information value before the GameStop event but deteriorated into noise afterward, suggesting that collective action can function
as ’collective intelligence’ only under specific conditions.
Against this backdrop, we employ a novel ’Dual Validation Methodology’ to elucidate the essence of the HVRP phenomenon. We analyze HVRP
events using (1) a **categorical** variable examining _’who’ led_ the event (institutions/foreigners vs. retail), and (2) a **continuous** variable measuring _’how_
_intensely’ they led_ (Dominance Score). Remarkably, these two methodologies
yielded starkly contrasting results. The categorical approach showed strong
predictive power, while the continuous approach exhibited correlations converging to zero. This initially suggested that investor identity matters while
intensity does not.
However, our central discovery is that this initial interpretation was incomplete. By introducing a **double-sort methodology** that combines investor type classification with quartile-based intensity analysis, we uncover


3


a powerful monotonic relationship that prior methods obscured. For institutional investors, events in the highest conviction quartile (measured as net
buying relative to market capitalization) generate cumulative abnormal returns of **+12.12%** over 50 days, while the lowest quartile yields modest
returns (4.65%). This perfect monotonic pattern (Q1<Q2<Q3<Q4) demonstrates that intensity matters profoundly—but only when measured correctly.
The critical methodological insight is that _how we normalize intensity de-_
_termines whether we detect informed trading signals_ . When intensity is normalized by daily trading value (measuring participation in trading flow), the
monotonic pattern breaks down completely (Q2: +12.77% > Q4: +3.64%).
But when normalized by market capitalization (measuring conviction as position size relative to firm value), the relationship becomes crystal clear. This
demonstrates that the near-zero correlation with the Dominance Score does
not mean intensity is irrelevant; it means the relationship is _nonlinear, type-_
_dependent, and critically sensitive to measurement specification_ . Prior studies may have missed this relationship by using inappropriate normalization
benchmarks or failing to account for investor heterogeneity.
Therefore, our study has four objectives. First, we replicate An et al.
(2006)’s study with 2020-2024 data to verify whether the HVRP phenomenon
remains robust despite the 20-year gap and market structural changes. Second, we conduct the _first empirical test_ of the ’investor type hypothesis’ that
remained an ’inference’ in the original study, using actual investor-level trading data. This positions our findings within the core finance debate of “noise
traders” (Barber and Odean, 2007) versus “informed traders” (KANIEL et al.,
2008). Third, we demonstrate that trading intensity matters profoundly but
is only detectable when measured correctly—specifically, when normalized
by market capitalization rather than trading value, revealing a monotonic
conviction-return relationship that prior methods obscured. Fourth, we analyze how modern market phenomena—the COVID-19 shock and ’Donghak
Ant Movement’—moderate these core relationships, demonstrating that extreme conditions can temporarily transform traditional patterns.


**2. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development**


This study goes beyond merely confirming the existence of the High Volume Return Premium (HVRP) to identify its sources— _’who’ (Who)_ generates it, and whether it is a matter of _’how much’ (How much)_ or _’what_
_context’ (Context)_ from a contemporary perspective.


4


_2.1. Theoretical Background: Beyond Visibility Shocks_
The theoretical landscape explaining volume-return relationships has evolved
substantially beyond the foundational work of Merton et al. (1987) and Gervais et al. (2001). Three complementary theoretical streams now provide
rigorous foundations for understanding HVRP.
**Investor Recognition and Limited Attention.** Merton et al. (1987)’s
‘Investor Recognition Hypothesis’ posits that investors include only stocks
they are aware of in their consideration set. When a stock’s recognition
increases, its investor base expands, lowering required returns and increasing prices through risk diversification effects. Gervais et al. (2001) applied
this theory to trading volume, establishing the HVRP phenomenon: under investors’ ‘limited attention,’ abnormal volume spikes serve as ‘attention
shocks,’ attracting new buying interest and causing sustained price increases.
DA et al. (2011) operationalized attention directly using Google Search Volume Index (SVI), finding that increased attention leads to higher near-term
prices with eventual reversal—a pattern central to understanding HVRP dynamics.
**Rational Inattention Models.** Kacperczyk et al. (2016) develop an
equilibrium model where fund managers optimally allocate scarce attention,
generating different risk premia for high-attention stocks. Peng and Xiong
(2006) show that investors with limited processing capacity engage in ‘category learning,’ processing more market-level than firm-specific information—
explaining why high-volume stocks receiving attention might command different returns. These models provide rigorous information-theoretic foundations for attention-based return patterns.
**Heterogeneous Beliefs and Speculation.** Scheinkman and Xiong
(2003) demonstrate that overconfident investors combined with short-sale
constraints generate speculative bubbles—high trading volume reflects disagreement that produces a ‘resale option’ premium. This mechanism is particularly relevant for retail-dominated markets like Korea, where short-sale
constraints are significant. DeFusco et al. (2022) develop a dynamic theory showing how predictable price increases attract short-term investors who
amplify volume through feedback trading.
**Information Asymmetry and Liquidity.** Campbell et al. (1993) show
that when liquidity traders sell, risk-averse market makers demand higher
expected returns—volume thus captures risk premium information. BLUME
et al. (1994) demonstrate that volume provides information about signal


5


precision unavailable from prices alone, offering a fundamental reason why
volume should predict returns.
**Cross-Country Evidence.** Kaniel et al. (2012) analyze HVRP across
41 countries and find that the premium is pervasive globally but varies with
market characteristics. The magnitude associates with individual investor
participation, short-selling constraints, and information asymmetry—all factors where Korea differs substantially from developed markets. Merton et al.
(1987) posits that abnormal trading volume positively relates to future investment and financing activities, with effects more pronounced in financially constrained firms with low investor recognition—providing a real-effects
channel through which HVRP operates.
**The Korean Market Puzzle.** In the Korean market, An et al. (2006)
empirically confirmed HVRP using 2001-2003 data, finding stronger premiums in large-cap stocks which they interpreted as related to lower information asymmetry in stocks with higher institutional ownership. However,
subsequent research by Chae and Kang (2019) documents a striking reversal:
using Korean data, they find that _low-volume_ stocks outperform high-volume
stocks—a Low Volume Return Premium (LVRP) rather than HVRP. Of 70
sample configurations, 16 show significant LVRP versus only 1 showing significant HVRP. They attribute this to mean-reversion of trading volume and
positive contemporaneous correlation between returns and volume changes
(CCRV). This pattern directly contradicts U.S. evidence and creates a puzzle our study addresses: whether the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
retail trading surge altered this relationship, potentially shifting Korea toward developed-market HVRP patterns.


_2.2. Core Debate: Are Retail Investors ’Noise’ or ’Information’?_
To understand HVRP drivers, we must identify the actors causing abnormal volume, particularly the nature of ’retail investors.’ Academia is divided
into two opposing views engaged in intense debate.
**First, the ’Noise Trader’ hypothesis.** Barber and Odean (2007)
revealed that retail investors tend to net-buy stocks that are ’attentiongrabbing’—such as those with media coverage or volume spikes—rather than
conducting fundamental analysis. BARBER et al. (2022) use Robinhood
data to show that app-induced attention causes herding—stocks with the
largest daily user increases subsequently lose approximately 4.7% over the
following month. Recently, BARBER et al. (2022) reported that new retail
investors’ remarkable daily turnover rate (18.12%) stems from overconfidence


6


rather than information value, with their net purchases negatively predicting future returns. Statman et al. (2006) provide complementary evidence
that share turnover positively relates to lagged returns for many months,
consistent with overconfidence driving excessive trading. Under this view,
retail-led HVRP represents merely temporary price pressure, unable to generate long-term excess returns.
**Second, the ’Liquidity Provider & Informed Trader’ hypothe-**
**sis.** In contrast, KANIEL et al. (2008) and Kaniel et al. (2012) argued that
retail investors earn liquidity premiums by making contrarian investments
in response to institutional liquidity demands. KELLEY and TETLOCK
(2013) confirm that retail order imbalances positively predict returns over
days to weeks. Furthermore, BOEHMER et al. (2021) showed through recent order flow analysis that retail net purchases predict approximately 10bp
short-term excess returns (annualized 5%), suggesting retail investors may
possess information value. This paradox—that retail trades predict returns
yet retail investors underperform—is resolved by Barber et al. (2024), who
show that retail investors provide liquidity by trading contrarian, predicting
returns but losing on implementation costs.
**Empirical Evidence on Investor Heterogeneity.** Stoffman (2014)
compared institutional and retail trading behavior, finding that institutions
engage in information-based trading while retail investors tend toward noise
trading, implying that the two groups’ trades have different effects on market
returns. Using actual trading records, Stoffman (2014) analyzed 15 years of
Finnish data and discovered that when institutions buy from retail investors
prices rise, and when institutions sell to retail investors prices fall, while
retail-to-retail trades show no consistent pattern and prices quickly revert.
This empirically supports theories that institutions and retail investors differ
in information processing ability and trading purposes.
**Korean Market Investor Composition.** Korea’s market exhibits substantial retail investor participation, creating a unique laboratory for testing
investor heterogeneity effects. Bae et al. (2011) show that foreigners in Korea behave like short-term momentum traders while individual investors act
as contrarians. Choe et al. (1999) document strong positive feedback trading and herding by foreign investors during the Asian crisis, establishing
precedents for understanding how different investor types respond to market
stress.
By separately analyzing institution/foreign-led versus retail-led events,
our study aims to provide decisive evidence for determining whether retail


7


investors in the Korean market are mere ’noise generators’ or meaningful
’market participants.’


_2.3. Modern Market Structural Changes: Crisis and Collective Action_
Since An et al. (2006) analyzed 2001-2003, modern stock markets have
experienced two major structural changes: the COVID-19 pandemic and
social media proliferation.
**COVID-19 and Retail Trading Surge.** Ozik et al. (2021) empirically demonstrated that the surge in retail investor trading through fintech
apps during COVID-19 lockdowns acted as a buffer preventing market liquidity depletion, dampening effective spread increases by approximately 40%.
Ortmann et al. (2020) show that retail investors increased trading intensity
by 13.9% as COVID cases doubled. In Korea specifically, the retail trading surge was extraordinary: Kim and Kim (2022) document that Korean
individual investor annual trading turnover reached above 1,600% during
March-October 2020. This suggests that retail investors’ roles during crises
may differ substantially from normal periods.
Critically, Kwak (2024) documents _significant attenuation_ in the positive
association between individual investor purchases and stock returns following
COVID-19 in Korea—suggesting the volume-return relationship structurally
changed. Kwak (2024) show that during the pandemic, Korean individual
investors continued buying while pension funds, foreign, and institutional
investors sold. This creates an ideal setting to test whether the traditional
noise trader characterization of retail investors holds during crisis periods
when they serve as liquidity providers.
**Social Media and Collective Action.** Bradley et al. (2023) analyzed online communities like ’WallStreetBets,’ discovering that individuals’ Due Diligence reports possessed significant information value before the
GME event but deteriorated into mere price pressure or attention-grabbing
noise after popularization. This implies that HVRP during Korea’s ’Donghak
Ant Movement’ period may exhibit patterns different from normal periods.
The collective action element—where retail investors coordinated through social media to absorb institutional selling pressure—mirrors Scheinkman and
Xiong (2003)’s speculation model but with an important twist: collective
information sharing may temporarily transform noise traders into informed
participants.

_2.4. Methodological Issue: Identity versus Intensity_
Prior studies have used both ’investor type (Identity)’ as a categorical
variable and ’trading intensity (Intensity)’ as a continuous variable when
analyzing investor behavior. However, recent studies suggest that the relationship between these two variables may be nonlinear.
Namouri et al. (2018) demonstrated that ’threshold effects’ exist in the
relationship between investor sentiment and returns, with relationships reversing or disappearing beyond certain levels. BARBER et al. (2022) also
suggested that new investors’ high trading intensity is merely a ’symptom’ of
their ’inexperience’ identity, not the essence of predictive power. Han et al.
(2022) document that expected returns relate positively to volume among
underpriced stocks but negatively among overpriced stocks—volume _ampli-_
_fies_ mispricing asymmetrically. Medhat and Schmeling (2021) find that lowturnover stocks exhibit short-term reversal while high-turnover stocks display
short-term momentum, demonstrating that volume conditions the return dynamics.
These findings suggest that when analyzing HVRP, examining only the
linear correlation between net purchase intensity (Dominance Score) and returns is insufficient. An identity-centered approach to ’who led,’ combined
with proper nonlinear analysis of intensity effects, is necessary.


_2.5. Research Hypotheses_
Based on the above discussion, we establish the following hypotheses.
**Hypothesis 1 (Investor Type Heterogeneity):** The sources of high
volume return premium differ by investor type.


  - **1a:** Abnormal volume events led by **institutions and foreign in-**
**vestors** with information advantages will show persistent positive longterm excess returns (CAR).


  - **1b:** Events led by **retail investors** with limited attention and behavioral biases will show transient price increases followed by dissipation,
failing to generate significant long-term excess returns (supporting the
noise trader hypothesis).


**Hypothesis 2 (Moderating Effects of Modern Market Shocks):**
Extreme market environments alter HVRP patterns.


9


  - **2a:** During periods of increased uncertainty from **COVID-19 shocks**,
information asymmetry intensifies, amplifying the signaling effect of
information-based trading (institutions/foreigners).


  - **2b:** During the **’Donghak Ant Movement’** period, retail investors’
collective action (coordination) through social media strengthens, causing retail-led events to show exceptionally strong persistence.


**Hypothesis 3 (Nonlinearity and the Critical Role of Normaliza-**
**tion):** The predictive power of trading intensity is nonlinear and is only
revealed when intensity is measured as a function of firm size.


  - **3a (Linear Model Fails):** A simple linear correlation between a composite ’smart money’ intensity score (Dominance Score) and future returns will be weak or insignificant, because the relationship operates
through discrete regimes rather than continuous linear effects.


  - **3b (Monotonic Pattern Emerges):** After sorting events by investor
type, a conditional analysis will reveal a strong, positive, and **mono-**
**tonic relationship** between buying intensity and future returns for
informed investors (institutions/foreigners).


  - **3c (Normalization is Critical):** This monotonic relationship will
only emerge when intensity is normalized by **market capitalization**,
which captures investor conviction (size of position relative to firm
value), not merely participation in daily trading flow.


  - **3d (The Horse Race):** When intensity is normalized by daily trading value instead of market capitalization, the monotonic pattern will
be significantly weaker or absent, demonstrating that measuring conviction relative to firm size is the superior specification for detecting
informed trading signals.


**3. Research Design**


_3.1. Data and Sample Selection_
This study applies An et al. (2006)’s 2001-2003 research to the current
market (January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024) to verify the persistence
of the High Volume Return Premium phenomenon. Following the original


10


study, we examine all stocks listed on the Korea Exchange and additionally
perform detailed analysis of individual KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets.
**Data Collection:** Daily stock price and trading volume data were collected via Daishin Securities’ Creon Plus DataReader API. Investor typespecific net purchase data (institutional, foreign, and retail investor transactions) were collected using the pykrx library, which provides official Korea
Exchange data. The data collection targets individual listed stocks only and
includes daily prices, trading volume, and outstanding shares.
**Sample Exclusion Criteria:** To ensure consistency with the original
study and data quality, we applied the following exclusion criteria to refine
the sample:


  - Delisted stocks and stocks under administrative issues


  - Stocks priced below 1,000 won (to exclude low-liquidity penny stocks)


  - Stocks with zero trading volume for two or more consecutive days
(liquidity-deficient stocks)


  - Stocks with changes in outstanding shares during the 20 trading days
prior to the event date (to exclude effects of stock splits, mergers, or
other capital structure changes)


_3.2. Research Methodology_
We faithfully follow An et al. (2006)’s methodology while applying additional dual validation methodology to test the investor type hypothesis.


_3.2.1. Event Date Definition_
An event date of abnormal trading volume is defined as a day when
an individual stock’s daily volume exceeds 5 times its past 20-day moving
average volume ( _ADTV >_ 5).


_V oli,t_
_ADTVi,t_ = 1 ~~�~~ 20
20 _j_ =1 _[V ol][i,t][−][j]_


Events occurring within 50 trading days after an initial event are considered
dependent events and excluded from analysis.


11


_3.2.2. Dual Validation Methodology_
To robustly test the investor type hypothesis, we employ two independent
methodologies in parallel.
**Method 1: Double-Sort Methodology by Investor Type and In-**
**tensity**
This is our primary methodology, representing our main contribution.
We employ a two-stage classification process that separates investor identity
from trading intensity.
**Stage 1: Investor Type Classification**
Each abnormal volume event is classified according to the net purchase
ratios of three investor types (institutions, foreigners, retail) using an argmax
rule. The investor group with the highest net buy ratio (measured initially
as a percentage of total trading value for classification purposes) is identified
as the _leading investor_ :


  - **Institution-Led:** If institutional net buy ratio exceeds both foreign
and retail ratios


  - **Foreign-Led:** If foreign net buy ratio exceeds both institutional and
retail ratios


  - **Retail-Led:** If retail net buy ratio exceeds both institutional and foreign ratios


**Stage 2: Intensity Quantification with Alternative Normaliza-**
**tions**
After identifying the leading investor type, we quantify purchase _convic-_
_tion intensity_ using a quartile-based classification system. Critically, we test
two alternative normalization specifications:
_Specification A (Trading Value Normalization):_

Intensity _[TV]_ _k,i,t_ [=] Net Buy Value _k,i,t_
Total Trading Value _i,t_


_Specification B (Market Capitalization Normalization):_

Intensity _[MC]_ _k,i,t_ [=] Net Buy Value _k,i,t_
Market Capitalization _i,t_


where _k_ denotes the leading investor type. Specification A measures an
investor’s _participation_ in daily trading flow, while Specification B measures


12


their _conviction_ as position size relative to firm value. We calculate quartiles
(Q1-Q4) based on the distribution of intensity (including sign) across all
events of that investor type. Q1 represents the lowest intensity, while Q4
represents the highest conviction buying.
**Methodological Rationale:** This double-sort approach allows us to
test whether the relationship between trading intensity and future returns
depends on how intensity is measured. If market cap normalization produces
a monotonic pattern while trading value normalization does not, this reveals
that the choice of normalization is fundamental to detecting informed trading
signals, not merely a technical detail.
**Method 2: Baseline Linear Correlation Analysis**
To establish a baseline for comparison, we test the simplest possible linear
relationship using a composite "smart money" intensity score. This method
measures the combined net purchase intensity of information-advantaged investors (institutions + foreigners) as a continuous variable:


Dominance Score _i,t_ = [Institution Net Buy] _[i,t]_ [+][ Foreign Net Buy] _[i,t]_

Total Trading Value _i,t_


For each event, we calculate forward returns at 5-day, 20-day, and 60day horizons and analyze Pearson correlation coefficients between dominance
scores and forward returns by firm size (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap).
**Forward Returns Calculation:** Forward returns are defined as the
return from the event day closing price to the closing price after the target
period. To account for non-trading days (weekends, holidays), we use the
closing price of the trading day closest to the target period within a range of
80% to 150%. For example, for 20-day forward returns, we select the trading
day closest to day 20 within the 16-30 day range. This approach prevents
data loss due to non-trading days while maintaining proximity to the target
period.
**Methodological Complementarity:** Method 2 provides a critical benchmark. If this simple linear correlation shows near-zero coefficients, while
Method 1’s quartile-based analysis reveals strong monotonic patterns, this
demonstrates that the relationship is _nonlinear and type-dependent_ . The
failure of linear models does not indicate that intensity is irrelevant; it reveals that proper detection requires: (1) accounting for investor heterogeneity
through type-based sorting, (2) using nonlinear quartile analysis rather than
linear correlation, and (3) normalizing by the correct benchmark (market


13


cap rather than trading value). Method 2’s weak results thus validate the
necessity of Method 1’s more sophisticated approach.


_3.2.3. Abnormal Return Calculation_
Using event study methodology, we calculate cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) around event dates (-50 to +50 days). Abnormal returns (AR)
use the market-adjusted return model ( _ARi,t_ = _Ri,t −_ _RM,t_ ).


**4. Empirical Results**


_4.1. Descriptive Statistics: ADTV Distribution_
Before presenting event study results, we examine the distribution characteristics of abnormal daily trading volume (ADTV) in our sample period
and compare them with the original study.


Table 1: ADTV Basic Statistics Comparison


**Statistic** **Original Study (2001-2003)** **This Study (2020-2024)**


Mean 1.029 1.379
Median 0.773 0.686
Std. Dev. 0.935 8.292
Skewness 3.819 139.268
Kurtosis 27.042 43,503.08
Min 0.000 0.000
Max 14.439 3,789.10
Observations 65,490 2,753,106


The ADTV distribution exhibits dramatically higher skewness (139.27 vs.
3.82) and kurtosis (43,503 vs. 27) compared to the original study, indicating
that modern markets experience more extreme trading volume events. The
maximum ADTV increased from 14.44 to 3,789.10, reflecting the increased
frequency of extraordinary market events during our sample period.


Table 2: ADTV Cumulative Distribution (2020-2024)


**ADTV Range** **Frequency** **Proportion (%)** **Cumulative Freq.** **Cumulative (%)**


[0, 5) 2,677,890 97.32 2,677,890 97.32

[5, 10) 39,262 1.43 2,717,152 98.75

[10, 15) 11,964 0.43 2,729,116 99.19
15+ 22,395 0.81 2,751,511 100.00


Only 2.68% of observations exceed the ADTV threshold of 5, yielding our
event sample of approximately 73,500 total abnormal volume events (after


14


excluding dependent events within 50 days, the final sample contains 26,604
independent events as shown in subsequent analyses).


_4.2. Methodological Transparency: Analysis Specifications_
To ensure reproducibility and clarity, Table 3 documents the specific
methodological approach used for each empirical analysis in this paper. Our
study employs two primary normalization methods: (1) Market Cap Rankbased classification for broad market comparisons, and (2) Market Cap Normalization for intensity-based quartile analyses. This methodological variation reflects the specific research question addressed in each section.


Table 3: Methodological Specifications by Analysis Section

4.6.4 Donghak Ant Retail Transformation Standard Event Study

_Market Cap Rank_ : Firms classified by market cap percentile (large/mid/small).
_Market Cap Normalization_ : Intensity = Net Buy Value / Market Capitalization.
All analyses use event windows of [-50, +50] trading days with ADTV threshold = 5.


This methodological framework ensures that each research question is addressed with the most appropriate measurement approach, while maintaining
consistency within each analytical dimension.


_4.3. Evolution of HVRP: 20 Years of Change_
We examine whether the HVRP phenomenon observed by An et al. (2006)
in the early 2000s remains valid in the rapidly changing 2020s market environment and how it has evolved.
Key findings:


1. **Increased Effect Size** : Event day AAR increased from 5.06% to
6.15%, approximately 22% higher
2. **Enhanced Statistical Significance** : Increased sample size (1,360 →
26,604 events) improved reliability
3. **Phenomenon Robustness** : HVRP persists despite 20-year gap

_4.4. Market Structural Characteristics: Firm Size and Market Type_
While An et al. (2006) found the strongest effects in large-cap stocks, we
confirm that the premium center has shifted to **mid-cap** stocks.


Table 5: Event Study Results by Firm Size: Mid-Cap Dominance Phenomenon


**Large-cap (1-100)** **Mid-cap (101-300)** **Small-cap (300+)**
**Day** **AAR** **t-stat** **CAR** **AAR** **t-stat** **CAR** **AAR** **t-stat** **CAR**


0 4.41% 10.79*** 2.47% **6.06%** 25.19*** 4.21% 6.19% 115.92*** 1.93%
50 -0.01% -0.04 1.43% **0.16%** 1.98** **4.00%** 0.01% 0.61 3.07%


Mid-cap 50-day CAR reaches 4.00%, dominating large-cap (1.43%) and
small-cap (3.07%). This suggests mid-cap stocks have emerged as the new
’opportunity window’ in modern markets, positioned between informationtransparent large-caps and liquidity-constrained small-caps.


_4.5. Sources of Investor Type Premium: Core Findings_
The most important contribution of our study—investor type analysis—
provides clear answers to a longstanding finance debate. Using our datadriven classification methodology, we categorized all 26,604 abnormal volume
events by leading investor type.
**Key Findings:** When we decompose each investor type by trading intensity (market cap normalized), three fundamentally distinct patterns emerge
that reveal the nature of each investor group’s information advantage:

**Investor Type & Intensity** **N Events** **Day 0 AAR (%)** **Day +20 CAR (%)** **Day +50 CAR (%)**

*Market cap normalization applied. Intensity quartiles computed within each investor type.
Total events differ from 26,604 due to data filtering requirements for intensity calculation.


**Institutional Investors Exhibit Monotonic Positive Relationship**
**(Information Advantage):** As institutional buying intensity increases from
Q1 to Q4, day +50 CAR rises monotonically from 4.65% to 12.12%. This
demonstrates that high-conviction institutional buying (Q4) predicts substantially higher long-term returns, validating the information advantage hypothesis. The strongest institutional conviction generates more than 200
times better returns than their lowest-conviction trades.
**Foreign Investors Show Monotonic Pattern (Information Ad-**
**vantage):** Foreign investors display a clear monotonic relationship similar
to institutions. Day +50 CAR increases from -0.33% (Q1) to 13.30% (Q4),
demonstrating that higher foreign buying intensity predicts higher long-term
returns. Notably, Q1 shows slightly negative returns, suggesting that lowconviction foreign trades may reflect liquidity or rebalancing motives rather
than information.
**Retail Investors Display Flat Pattern (Pure Noise Trading):**
Most strikingly, retail investors exhibit a **flat** pattern—regardless of buying intensity from Q1 to Q4, day +50 CAR remains clustered around zero
with no discernible monotonic relationship. All quartiles show near-zero returns (0.56% to 0.65%). This flat pattern provides powerful evidence that
retail investors are pure noise traders whose trades contain zero predictive


17


information—neither positive nor negative.
**Core Discovery:** The intensity-return relationship is fundamentally _dif-_
_ferent_ across investor types. Institutional Q4 (12.12%) demonstrates strong
positive returns, while retail trades cluster around zero regardless of conviction level. This clean separation between “information” (institutions show
monotonic pattern) and “noise” (retail shows flat pattern) provides the clearest empirical distinction in the literature. **Methodological Foundations.**
Our empirical approach follows established best practices from top finance
journals. For standard errors in panel data, we follow Petersen (2008), who
provides the definitive comparison of clustered standard errors versus FamaMacBeth approaches. For event study methodology with long-horizon returns, we follow Lyon et al. (1999), who document biases in buy-and-hold
abnormal returns (BHAR) methodology and propose solutions. For investor
classification using Korean Exchange data, we follow precedents established
by Choe et al. (1999) and Campbell et al. (2009).
This **strongly supports Hypothesis 1** and provides nuanced evidence
beyond simple investor type comparisons.
This finding directly contradicts KANIEL et al. (2008) and BOEHMER
et al. (2021)’s claims of retail investor sophistication, while providing granular, intensity-decomposed support for Barber and Odean (2007) and BARBER et al. (2022)’s ’noise trader’ hypothesis using 2020s Korean market
data.


_4.6. Main Finding: Intensity Matters, But Measurement is Critical_
While Section 4.3 established that investor identity matters, we now
demonstrate that trading intensity _also_ matters profoundly—but its effect is
nonlinear and only revealed when measured correctly. This section presents
our central methodological contribution: demonstrating that the choice of
normalization is not a technical detail but a fundamental determinant of
whether we detect informed trading signals.


_4.6.1. The Horse Race: Market Cap vs. Trading Value Normalization_
We test two alternative specifications for measuring institutional buying
intensity:


  - **Specification A (Trading Value):** Intensity = [Institution Net Buy Value]

Total Daily Trading Value


  - **Specification B (Market Cap):** Intensity = [Institution Net Buy Value]

Market Capitalization


18


Specification A measures an institution’s _participation_ in daily trading
flow—what percentage of today’s trading activity did they dominate? Specification B measures an institution’s _conviction_ —how large a position did
they take relative to the firm’s total value?
For both specifications, we classify events by investor type and then into
quartiles (Q1-Q4) based on the intensity distribution, calculating 50-day cumulative abnormal returns for each group. Table 7 presents results for all
three investor types.


Table 7: Horse Race Comparison: Trading Value vs. Market Cap Normalization by
Investor Type

Q3 5.36% -1.44% 6.30% 0.88%
Q4 (Highest) 0.03% -4.71% 6.00% 0.65%



**Monotonicity** Broken (Q3>Q4 for Inst/For) **Perfect for Inst/For, Flat for Retail**


**The Results Are Striking:**
**Specification A (Trading Value) Fails:** While Q2, Q3, and Q4 all
show positive returns, the pattern is _non-monotonic_ . The strongest returns
appear in Q2 (12.77%), not Q4 (3.64%). This broken monotonicity suggests
that trading value normalization conflates informed conviction with noise
trading participation.
**Specification B (Market Cap) Succeeds:** A **perfect monotonic**
**relationship** emerges. Day +50 CAR progresses cleanly from 4.65% (Q1)
_→_ +4.99% (Q2) _→_ +9.02% (Q3) _→_ +12.12% (Q4). This demonstrates that
when institutions take larger positions _relative to firm size_, they are acting
on stronger information.
**Economic Interpretation:** Market capitalization normalization captures _conviction_ . An institution buying $1M worth of stock sends a very different signal if the firm is worth $10M (10% conviction) versus $1B (0.0001%


19


participation). Trading value normalization conflates high-conviction small
bets with low-conviction large trades, obscuring the true information signal.
**Three Economic Mechanisms Explain This Difference:**


1. **Conviction vs. Participation:** Market cap normalization measures
how significant a position is relative to the firm’s total value—capturing
the investor’s _conviction_ in their thesis. Trading value normalization
merely measures participation in daily trading flow, which conflates
informed conviction with noise trading volume.
2. **Conflated Signals on High-Volume Days:** High trading value days
often coincide with elevated retail participation. Normalizing by trading value makes institutional trades appear smaller precisely on these
high-volume days, diluting the conviction signal when it matters most.
Market cap normalization is immune to this confound.
3. **Monotonicity Implies Information:** The emergence of a perfect
monotonic relationship (Q1 _<_ Q2 _<_ Q3 _<_ Q4) for institutions under market cap normalization demonstrates that conviction intensity _directly_
_predicts_ future returns—a hallmark of informed trading. The broken
monotonicity under trading value normalization reveals that this specification fails to capture the true information signal.


**Robustness Across Investor Types:** The superiority of market cap
normalization extends beyond institutional investors. Foreign investors exhibit an identical pattern: perfect monotonicity under market cap normalization (-0.33% _→_ 13.30%) versus a flat, broken pattern under trading value
normalization (5.16% _→_ 5.64%). Retail investors confirm the noise trader
hypothesis under market cap normalization—all quartiles cluster near zero
with no discernible pattern—while trading value normalization produces a
misleading _inverted_ pattern (6.21% for Q1 versus -4.71% for Q4), falsely
suggesting that high-intensity retail buying predicts negative returns. This
systematic difference across all investor types confirms that the choice of
normalization is the key methodological insight, not a technical detail.
**Quantifying the Normalization Difference:** The magnitude of the
normalization choice impact is striking:


  - **Institution-Led Q4:** Market cap normalization yields +12.12%, while
trading value yields +3.64%—a spread of approximately 8.5 percentage
points and a 3.3 _×_ difference.


20


  - **Foreign-Led Q4:** Market cap yields +13.30% versus +5.64%—a spread
of approximately 7.7 percentage points.


  - **Retail-Led:** Market cap produces a flat pattern confirming noise
trading, while trading value produces a misleading inverted pattern—
demonstrating that improper normalization can generate spurious signals.


These spreads demonstrate that the choice between conviction-based (market cap) and participation-based (trading value) normalization is not merely
a methodological preference but a fundamental determinant of whether researchers correctly identify informed trading signals.


_4.6.2. Monotonic Pattern Analysis: Institutions vs. Retail_
Figure 1 visualizes the monotonic relationship for institution-led events
under market cap normalization.


Figure 1: Monotonic Pattern by Investor Type (Market Cap Normalization)


The plot confirms three critical findings:
**(1) Q1 (Lowest Intensity):** Lowest-intensity institutional events generate modest returns (4.65%), suggesting that even low-conviction institutional
positions contain some predictive value, though far less than high-conviction
trades.
**(2) Q2-Q3 (Moderate Conviction):** Moderate institutional buying
generates positive but modest returns (+4.99% and +9.02%), indicating weak
positive information signals.
**(3) Q4 (High Conviction):** The highest quartile generates exceptional
returns (+12.12%), more than double Q3’s returns. This nonlinear jump
suggests a _threshold effect_ —only the most convicted institutional positions
predict substantial future performance.


21


**Retail Investors: Flat/Noise Pattern**
The market cap normalization reveals a striking _flat pattern_ for retail
investors. While institutions show perfect monotonicity with Q4 predicting
+12.12% returns, retail investors show near-zero returns regardless of conviction level—all quartiles cluster around zero with no discernible pattern. This
confirms the pure noise trader hypothesis: retail trades contain no predictive information whatsoever, neither positive nor negative. Unlike a contraindicator (which would show inverted monotonicity), pure noise traders are
simply irrelevant to price discovery.
**The Danger of Wrong Normalization:** Strikingly, trading value normalization produces a _misleading inverted_ pattern for retail investors, with
Q1 yielding +6.21% and Q4 yielding -4.71%. A naive researcher using this
specification might falsely conclude that high-intensity retail buying predicts
_negative_ returns—that retail investors are contra-indicators. Our market
cap normalization reveals this interpretation is incorrect: retail investors are
pure noise traders whose trades contain zero information, neither positive nor
negative. The inverted pattern under trading value normalization is an artifact of measurement, not a reflection of economic reality. This demonstrates
the critical importance of proper normalization: using the wrong specification can generate spurious signals that lead to incorrect conclusions about
investor behavior.
**Why Does This Matter?**
This finding resolves a longstanding puzzle in behavioral finance. Prior
studies found mixed evidence on whether trading intensity matters (Namouri
et al., 2018; BARBER et al., 2022), leading some to conclude that intensity
is irrelevant. Our results demonstrate that intensity matters enormously,
but researchers must measure it correctly. The failure of linear correlation
models (Dominance Score analysis in Section 4.5) does not mean intensity
is irrelevant—it means the relationship is _nonlinear_ and _type-dependent_, requiring proper quartile-based analysis with conviction-based normalization.
**Implications for Hypothesis 3:** These results strongly support all four
sub-hypotheses:


  - **H3a:** Linear Dominance Score correlation _≈_ 0 (confirmed in Section
4.5)


  - **H3b:** Monotonic relationship emerges after investor type sorting (confirmed: Q1<Q2<Q3<Q4)


22


  - **H3c:** Market cap normalization reveals the pattern (confirmed: perfect
monotonicity)


  - **H3d:** Trading value normalization fails (confirmed: broken monotonicity, Q3>Q4)


_4.7. Methodological Validation: Nonlinearity of Identity versus Intensity_
The second approach of our dual validation methodology presents highly
interesting evidence of ’nonlinearity.’ We analyze correlations between Dominance Score and forward returns across multiple time horizons.

**Firm Size** **Observations** **Correlation** **P-value** **Mean Return**

Large-cap 473 -0.0861 0.061 0.88%
Mid-cap 1,546 0.0112 0.660 0.12%
Small-cap 25,753 0.0000 1.000 0.61%


Table 10: Correlation Between Dominance Score and 60-Day Forward Returns


**Firm Size** **Observations** **Correlation** **P-value** **Mean Return**


Large-cap 473 -0.0553 0.230 0.18%
Mid-cap 1,545 -0.0269 0.290 0.02%
Small-cap 25,743 0.0008 0.897 1.24%


Across all three time horizons (5-day, 20-day, 60-day) and all firm size
categories, correlations consistently converge to near-zero (|r| < 0.09) and
are completely statistically insignificant (all p > 0.06). This robust pattern
across multiple horizons confirms this is not a time-specific artifact but a fundamental characteristic of the phenomenon. Critically, this does _not_ mean
intensity is irrelevant—as Section 4.4 demonstrated, intensity matters profoundly when measured correctly. Instead, these near-zero correlations reveal
three methodological limitations of the Dominance Score approach:


23


1. **Linear Model Inadequacy** : The relationship between intensity and
returns is nonlinear, operating through discrete quartile regimes rather
than continuous linear effects. Pearson correlation cannot capture
monotonic but nonlinear relationships.
2. **Investor Heterogeneity Ignored** : Pooling institutions and foreigners into a single "smart money" score masks type-specific patterns.
As Section 4.4 showed, institutions and foreigners exhibit different
intensity-return relationships.
3. **Wrong Normalization** : The Dominance Score uses trading value
normalization, which Section 4.4’s horse race demonstrated produces
broken monotonicity. Market cap normalization is required to reveal
the true pattern.


This validates our methodological choice in Section 4.4 to use type-specific,
quartile-based analysis with market cap normalization. The failure of linear
correlation does not indicate intensity is irrelevant—it validates the necessity
of more sophisticated methods to detect nonlinear, type-dependent relationships.


_4.8. Modern Market Phenomena: COVID-19 and Donghak Ant Movement_
Modern market phenomena such as COVID-19 and the Donghak Ant
Movement dramatically transformed traditional patterns. We analyze these
two critical periods to test Hypothesis 2.


_4.8.1. Market Condition Effects: Bull vs. Bear Markets_
The original study by An et al. (2006) found that HVRP appears stronger
during bull markets. We replicate this analysis using modern data to verify
whether this pattern persists. Market conditions are defined using a 20%
threshold: bull markets are identified when the KOSPI index rises 20% or
more from a prior trough, and bear markets when it falls 20% or more from
a prior peak.
The original study’s key finding that HVRP is stronger during bull markets is robustly replicated in modern markets. In bull markets, event day
AAR is 6.47% and 50-day CAR reaches 3.84%, while in bear markets these
are 5.47% and 1.50%, respectively. The absolute effect size increased in both
market conditions compared to the original study: bull markets increased
approximately 14% (from 5.668% to 6.47%), and bear markets increased approximately 23% (from 4.443% to 5.47%).

Original study (2001-2003): Bull 5.668% vs. Bear 4.443% (t-value 3.13***)


Interestingly, the relative difference narrowed slightly: the original study
showed a 1.225 percentage point difference between bull and bear markets
(5.668%-4.443%), while our study shows 1.003 percentage points (6.47%5.47%). This is because the effect size increase in bear markets (23%) exceeded that in bull markets (14%). Nevertheless, the differential effect by
market condition remains robust, confirming that the original study’s core
finding remains valid in modern markets.
The most striking divergence appears in the 50-day CAR: bull market
CAR of 3.84% is more than 2.5 times the bear market CAR of 1.50%. This
suggests that market psychology significantly moderates the informational
content embedded in abnormal volume events, with bullish sentiment amplifying and sustaining the price impact of volume shocks.
Figure 2 visually demonstrates the stark difference in CAR patterns by
market condition. In bull markets (panel a), CAR rises continuously after
the event day, reaching 3.835% by day +50. In bear markets (panel b), the
increase is relatively limited, reaching only 1.503%. This clearly illustrates
the moderating effect of market psychology on the informational value of
abnormal trading volume.

_4.8.2. Period Justification_
Our analysis focuses on two critical modern market phenomena: the
COVID-19 shock and the Donghak Ant Movement. Precise period definition is crucial for isolating the effects of these distinct market regimes. Table
13 summarizes our period definitions and their justifications.


Table 13: Period Justification Summary


**Period Definition** **Dates** **Core Rationale**


COVID-19 Shock Start 2020.02.01 Systemic risk transmission beginning in Korea, synchronization
with global markets, onset of structural deterioration in investment psychology
COVID-19 Shock End 2020.04.30 V-KOSPI volatility normalization, alignment with Baker et al.
(2020) analysis endpoint, distinction from subsequent liquiditydriven rally
Donghak Ant Start 2020.03.01 Large-scale retail buyback responding to foreign investor selloff,
manifestation of collective action
Donghak Ant End 2021.12.31 Policy rate increases (Aug/Nov 2021) deteriorating liquidity environment, retail investor shift to net selling, structural regime shift
to "Seohak" (U.S. market focus)


**COVID-19 Shock Period (February 1 - April 30, 2020):**
While Baker et al. (2020) used February 24 as the start date for U.S. markets, we begin our COVID-19 shock period on February 1, 2020, to account
for Korea’s earlier outbreak timing. Korea’s first confirmed case occurred on
January 20, 2020, and the Daegu-Gyeongbuk outbreak (the epicenter of Korea’s COVID-19 first wave) in mid-February created systemic risk earlier than
in U.S. markets. Financial markets pre-price real economy developments, and
Korean market sentiment deteriorated sharply in early-mid February, preceding the U.S. market crash. Using February 24 would miss critical initial shock


26


data specific to the Korean market context.
The end date of April 30, 2020, aligns with Baker et al. (2020)’s methodology for international consistency. The V-KOSPI (Korea’s volatility index,
analogous to the VIX in U.S. markets) reached historical peaks exceeding 60
points in March 2020 but fell below panic-selling thresholds by late April,
indicating volatility normalization. This endpoint clearly distinguishes the
collapse phase (February-April) from the subsequent V-shaped recovery and
liquidity rally (May onward).
**Donghak Ant Movement Period (March 1, 2020 - December 31,**
**2021):**
We define the Donghak Ant Movement period as March 2020 through
December 2021. The term "Donghak Ants" references the 1894 Donghak
Peasant Rebellion, representing retail investors’ collective defense against
foreign capital flight during the March 2020 market crash (Jung and Kim,
2021). March 2020 marked the transformation of retail investors from passive participants to active market defenders through massive net buying that
absorbed foreign institutional selling pressure. While retail buying occurred
in January-February 2020, March represented the organized, collective movement.
The period ends in December 2021 due to three structural shifts. First,
the Bank of Korea raised policy rates from 0.50% to 0.75% in August 2021
and to 1.00% in November 2021, ending the ultra-low interest rate environment that had fueled the movement and increasing margin loan costs.
Second, retail investors executed a structural reversal to massive net selling,
including a record 3+ trillion won single-day selloff on December 28, 2021.
Third, investor focus shifted from domestic market defense ("Donghak") to
U.S. market opportunities ("Seohak Ants," referring to retail investors who
subsequently shifted their capital to U.S. markets in late 2021), as KOSPI
stagnated near the 3,000 level while U.S. markets offered higher returns.
These period definitions capture inflection points where macroeconomic
indicators (interest rates) and microeconomic trading data (retail net purchases) undergo structural changes, providing temporally precise boundaries
optimized for HVRP research.


_4.8.3. COVID-19 Shock Analysis_
During the COVID-19 shock period, HVRP exhibited significant amplification contrary to expectations of weakening during crises.
Three key patterns emerge: (1) **Event day amplification** : Day 0 AAR

HVRP persists even during crisis periods; (3) **Pre-event information leak-**
**age** : Day -1 AAR of 1.28% far exceeds the full sample’s 0.66%, indicating
more active pre-trading during crisis uncertainty.
These results support Hypothesis 2a. As Ozik et al. (2021) demonstrated,
retail investors provided liquidity during institutional risk-averse selling, amplifying information signals embedded in abnormal volume. During crises
when liquidity constraints intensify, abnormal volume events carry stronger
informational content that is more powerfully reflected in prices.


_4.8.4. The Donghak Ant Movement: A Test of Collective Intelligence_
The “Donghak Ants” represents a pivotal phenomenon in Korean financial history. Named after the 1894 Donghak Peasant Rebellion—a grassroots
uprising against foreign intervention—the term emerged in March 2020 when
retail investors collectively mobilized to “defend” the Korean market against
foreign capital flight during the COVID-19 crash. This creates a unique
natural experiment: can coordinated retail trading, facilitated by social media and mobile platforms, generate information value that transforms noise
traders into meaningful market participants?
**Extraordinary Finding:** During the Donghak period, retail-led events
generated a day +50 CAR of 3.53%, compared to near-zero returns for retailled events in normal periods. This represents a **dramatic transformation**
**from zero to positive** —retail trades that normally contain no predictive
value suddenly generated meaningful persistent returns, strongly supporting
Hypothesis 2b.

This finding parallels Bradley et al. (2023)’s discovery that Reddit’s WallStreetBets possessed significant information value during the pre-GameStop
period before deteriorating into noise after popularization. During the Donghak movement, social media coordination and collective intelligence temporarily transformed retail investors from "noise traders" to meaningful market participants. The online community’s due diligence sharing and coordinated action created genuine information value, demonstrating that under
specific conditions—collective organization through social media during market stress—retail trading can transcend behavioral biases to generate persistent returns.
**Retail Investor Role Transformation During Donghak Period**
The most striking discovery is the dramatic transformation of retail-led
events’ characteristics across different periods. Table 16 presents a direct
comparison.


Table 16: Retail-Led Event Comparison: Normal vs. Donghak Period


**Period** **Day 0 AAR (%)** **Day 50 CAR (%)** **Characteristics**


Full Period Retail-Led 5.72 0.52 Rapid decay after initial shock, limited persistence
Donghak Period Retail-Led 6.24 3.53 Strong persistence, institutional-level effects


Under normal conditions, retail-led events show strong initial AAR of
5.72% on event day but rapidly decay to near-zero by day +50, confirming
retail investors as pure noise traders with zero predictive value. However,
during the Donghak period (March 2020 - December 2021), retail-led events
achieved 50-day CAR of 3.53%, comparable to institution-led (7.74%) and
foreign-led (6.03%) events in terms of persistence patterns, though still lower
in absolute magnitude.


29


This transformation can be attributed to three complementary mechanisms:


  - **Collective Intelligence Effect:** Online community platforms enabled
information sharing and collective due diligence, improving retail investors’ information processing capabilities similar to Bradley et al.’s
pre-GME WallStreetBets findings.


  - **Self-fulfilling Prophecy:** Coordinated massive buying pressure created genuine price impact that justified the initial volume signal.


  - **Structural Market Change:** Proliferation of mobile trading platforms and fintech accessibility fundamentally altered retail investor capabilities and market participation patterns.

**5. Discussion and Implications**


_5.1. Academic Contributions_
Our study contributes to existing literature in five aspects:
**First, transforming Ahn et al. (2005)’s ’inference’ into ’empir-**
**ical evidence.’** We conducted the first empirical test of the ’investor type
hypothesis’ proposed 20 years ago using actual data, confirming that investor
identity fundamentally determines the persistence of abnormal returns following volume spikes.
**Second, resolving the LVRP-HVRP puzzle in Korean markets.**
Chae and Kang (2019) documented that Korea exhibits a Low Volume Return Premium (LVRP)—the opposite of U.S. patterns. Our findings suggest
this apparent contradiction arises from measurement issues: when volume


30


is analyzed conditional on investor type and intensity is properly normalized, the relationship becomes clear. The LVRP finding may reflect pooling
heterogeneous investor effects, where retail-led volume events (which predominate in Korea’s retail-dominated market) drag down aggregate returns.
When decomposed by investor type, institution-led and foreign-led events
exhibit strong positive returns consistent with the information hypothesis,
while retail-led events show near-zero persistence. This reconciles Korean
evidence with developed market patterns.
**Third, resolving the intensity puzzle.** Prior studies reported mixed
or null findings on whether trading intensity predicts returns (Namouri et al.,
2018; BARBER et al., 2022; Han et al., 2022). We demonstrate that intensity
matters profoundly, but only when: (1) analyzed conditional on investor
type, (2) measured nonlinearly through quartile sorts, and (3) normalized
by market capitalization rather than trading value. This methodological
refinement reconciles decades of conflicting evidence.
**Fourth, providing contemporary evidence for core finance de-**
**bates.** The result of retail-led CAR _≈_ 0 contradicts KANIEL et al. (2008)
and BOEHMER et al. (2021) while supporting Barber and Odean (2007)
and BARBER et al. (2022)’s ’noise trader’ hypothesis. Moreover, the flat
intensity-return pattern for retail investors provides unprecedented empirical clarity—retail trades contain zero predictive information regardless of
conviction level.
**Fifth, identifying moderating effects of modern market shocks.**
Analysis of COVID-19 (31% HVRP amplification) and Donghak Ant Movement (transformation of retail-led CAR from near-zero to positive) demonstrates how traditional anomalies transform under extreme conditions, with
implications for understanding crisis-period trading behavior and social media coordination effects. This extends Kwak (2024)’s finding of attenuated
volume-return relationships post-COVID by showing that attenuation varies
dramatically by investor type.


_5.2. Resolving the PBFJ Puzzle: A Dialogue with Chae and Kang (2019)_
Our findings directly address the puzzle created by Chae and Kang (2019)
in this journal. Their documentation of a Low Volume Return Premium
(LVRP) in Korea contradicted two decades of global evidence and raised
fundamental questions about whether Asian market microstructure differs
systematically from developed markets.


31


**The Resolution:** We demonstrate that Chae and Kang’s LVRP finding
likely resulted from two methodological factors that our study addresses:


1. **Investor Type Pooling:** By analyzing aggregate volume without
decomposing by investor type, their methodology pooled informed institutional trading with uninformed retail trading. In Korea’s retaildominated market, the negative retail effect dominates aggregate statistics. When we separate investor types, institution-led events show clear
HVRP (+7.74% CAR), while retail-led events show near-zero persistence (+0.52% CAR).
2. **Normalization Specification:** Our “Horse Race” analysis demonstrates that intensity normalization matters critically. Trading value
normalization—the standard approach—produces broken monotonicity and weak signals. Market capitalization normalization reveals the
true conviction-return relationship. Prior studies using volume-based
metrics may have inadvertently obscured the informed trading signal.


**Reconciliation with Global Evidence:** When properly measured, Korean markets exhibit the same HVRP patterns documented globally by Gervais et al. (2001) and Kaniel et al. (2012). The apparent reversal is an
artifact of measurement, not a fundamental difference in market dynamics.
This reconciliation strengthens the theoretical universality of attention-based
and information-asymmetry models across international markets.
**Methodological Implications for Future PBFJ Research:** Our
findings suggest that studies examining volume-return relationships in retailheavy Asian markets should: (1) decompose by investor type, (2) employ
nonlinear analysis methods, and (3) consider conviction-based normalization.
These methodological refinements may reveal patterns previously obscured
by aggregate analysis.


_5.3. Behavioral Finance Interpretation_
Our findings can be interpreted through three behavioral finance mechanisms:
**Attention-Based Trading:** Consistent with Barber and Odean (2007),
abnormal volume serves as an attention shock that attracts investors. However, the differential persistence by investor type reveals that attention alone
does not explain returns—the _quality_ of attention matters. Institutional
attention reflects fundamental analysis, while retail attention often reflects
speculative interest.


32


**Herding Behavior and Collective Intelligence:** The Donghak Ant
Movement demonstrates that retail herding can occasionally generate information value. When social media coordination enables collective due diligence sharing and reduces individual behavioral biases through group wisdom, retail investors can temporarily transcend their typical noise-trading
tendencies. However, this represents an exception rather than the rule, consistent with Bradley et al. (2023)’s finding that online community information
value deteriorates after initial success.
**Information Processing Heterogeneity:** The stark differences between institutional (CAR 7.74%), foreign (6.03%), and retail (0.52%) outcomes reflect fundamental differences in information processing capabilities.
Institutions possess analytical resources, information networks, and professional training that enable them to identify and act on genuine value signals,
while retail investors operate with limited resources and are susceptible to
cognitive biases.


_5.4. Nonlinearity and Measurement Sensitivity_
The contrast between our methodologies reveals a critical insight into
HVRP’s underlying mechanism. Our double-sort methodology (Method 1)
uncovers strong monotonic patterns when using market cap normalization,
while linear correlation analysis (Method 2) shows near-zero coefficients. This
contrast demonstrates that the intensity-return relationship is **nonlinear,**
**type-dependent, and measurement-sensitive** .
**Both Identity AND Intensity Matter:** Our findings refine prior understanding. Section 4.3 confirmed that investor identity (institutions vs.
foreigners vs. retail) fundamentally matters. Section 4.4 then demonstrated
that intensity also matters profoundly, but the relationship is nonlinear and
only detectable with proper measurement. For institutions, the Q4-Q1 CAR
spread is 10.12 percentage points (10.07% - (-0.05%)), economically large and
highly significant. This refutes the simplistic interpretation that "intensity
doesn’t matter"—intensity matters enormously when measured as conviction
(market cap normalization) rather than participation (trading value normalization).
**Quartile Regimes vs. Linear Relationships:** The monotonic pattern
operates through discrete intensity quartiles rather than continuous linear
effects. Within each quartile, there may be limited variation, but crossing
from one quartile to the next predicts substantially different returns. This


33


explains why Pearson correlation fails—it assumes linearity, which is inappropriate for relationships operating through ordered regimes with threshold
effects between them.
**Implications for Methodology:** This finding has important methodological implications. Linear regression models assuming continuous relationships will underestimate or miss threshold effects entirely. Future research
on investor behavior and market anomalies should consider event-based approaches, regime-switching models, or machine learning methods capable of
capturing nonlinear relationships.
**The Choice of Normalization is Fundamental:** Perhaps the most
striking methodological finding is that the choice between market capitalization and trading value normalization is not merely a technical detail but
a fundamental determinant of whether researchers detect informed trading
signals. Our horse race analysis (Section 4.4.1) demonstrates that trading
value normalization produces broken monotonicity where Q2 (+12.77%) exceeds Q4 (+3.64%), obscuring any clear intensity-return relationship. Market cap normalization reveals the true conviction-return relationship with
perfect monotonicity, where highest-conviction trades (Q4: +12.12%) predict the strongest returns—a 3.3 _×_ difference in magnitude. This sensitivity
to normalization specification suggests that some prior null findings in the
literature may reflect measurement artifacts rather than absence of the underlying economic relationship. Researchers investigating informed trading
should carefully consider whether their normalization choice captures investor
conviction or merely trading participation.


_5.5. Practical Implications_
From an investment strategy perspective, identifying ’who led’ rather
than simply detecting volume spikes is crucial. Particularly, capturing abnormal volume led by institutions in mid-cap stocks can be the most effective alpha strategy. Additionally, the finding that information signals amplify
during crisis situations provides rationale for active crisis response strategies.
The threshold effect implies that quantitative trading strategies should
focus on binary signals (event occurrence) rather than continuous intensity
measures. Monitoring which investor type drives volume spikes offers more
predictive power than measuring the magnitude of their net purchases.


34


_5.6. Policy Implications_
Our findings carry important implications for Korean market regulators
and, by extension, regulators in other retail-heavy Asian markets.
**Retail Investor Protection.** The confirmed noise trading tendency of
retail investors—evidenced by their flat intensity-return pattern where trading has no predictive value regardless of conviction level—underscores the
need for investor education initiatives. Financial literacy programs should
emphasize that retail trading generates zero persistent returns and the importance of diversification. Enhanced disclosure requirements could help retail
investors make more informed decisions.
However, our Donghak Ant Movement findings demonstrate that retail investors can contribute positively under specific conditions. During the March
2020 crisis, coordinated retail buying provided crucial liquidity when institutional investors retreated. This suggests that policies should not uniformly
restrict retail participation but rather enable beneficial collective action while
implementing safeguards against manipulation.
**Short Selling Regulation Context.** Korea has implemented multiple
short-selling bans (most recently during 2020-2021). Our findings suggest
an important interaction: if retail investors are predominantly noise traders
whose trading generates near-zero persistent returns, short sellers may play
a limited role since there is no systematic retail-driven mispricing to correct. However, during collective action periods like Donghak, short selling
against coordinated retail buying could destabilize markets. This supports a
dynamic, context-dependent approach to short-selling regulation rather than
blanket restrictions.
**Market Microstructure Implications.** For practitioners and regulators monitoring market quality, our findings suggest that volume signals
should be interpreted conditionally on investor composition. Abnormal volume events carry fundamentally different information depending on whether
they are institution-led (informative, warranting price adjustment) or retailled (likely noise, warranting caution). Market surveillance systems could
benefit from incorporating investor-type decomposition when assessing the
information content of unusual trading activity.


**6. Conclusion**


This study resolves a longstanding puzzle in behavioral finance by demonstrating that both investor identity and trading intensity are critical deter

35


minants of the High Volume Return Premium—but only when intensity is
measured correctly. Our central contribution is methodological: we are the
first to show that the choice between normalizing trading intensity by market
capitalization versus trading value is not a technical detail but a fundamental
determinant of whether researchers detect informed trading signals.
**The Core Discovery: Measurement Matters**
Our double-sort methodology reveals a striking pattern. When we normalize institutional buying intensity by market capitalization (a proxy for
conviction), a perfect monotonic relationship emerges: events in the highest
conviction quartile (Q4) generate +12.12% cumulative abnormal returns over
50 days, while the lowest quartile (Q1) yields modest returns (+4.65%). In
sharp contrast, normalizing by daily trading value produces a broken monotonic pattern where Q2 (+12.77%) exceeds Q4 (+3.64%). This horse race
comparison definitively demonstrates that market cap normalization captures
the true economic relationship between informed trading and future returns.
**Reconciling Conflicting Evidence**
This finding reconciles decades of conflicting evidence. Prior studies reported weak or insignificant linear correlations between trading intensity
and returns (Namouri et al., 2018; BARBER et al., 2022), leading some
researchers to conclude that intensity is irrelevant—that "who" matters but
"how much" does not. Our results demonstrate this conclusion was premature. The near-zero correlation we observe with the Dominance Score
(r<0.04, p>0.16) does not indicate that intensity is irrelevant; it reveals that
the relationship is _nonlinear and type-dependent_ . Simple linear models fail
because they cannot capture threshold effects and investor heterogeneity.
When we decompose events by investor type and measure conviction correctly, intensity emerges as a powerful predictor. The Q4-Q1 spread for institutions is 7.47 percentage points (12.12% - 4.65%), economically large and
statistically robust. This demonstrates that institutional conviction, measured as position size relative to firm value, contains substantial predictive
power that prior methodologies failed to detect.
**Investor Identity Remains Critical**
While our main contribution concerns intensity measurement, we also
confirm that investor identity fundamentally matters. Institution-led and
foreign-led events generate persistent long-term returns (Day +50 CAR:
7.74% and 6.03%), while retail-led events rapidly dissipate (CAR: 0.52%).
Moreover, the market cap normalization reveals a flat intensity-return pattern for retail investors: their trading generates near-zero returns regard

36


less of conviction level, confirming the noise trader hypothesis (Barber and
Odean, 2007; BARBER et al., 2022) with unprecedented clarity. This heterogeneity validates our double-sort approach—intensity effects operate differently across investor types.
**Modern Market Context**
Our analysis of COVID-19 and the Donghak Ant Movement demonstrates
that these core relationships can transform under extreme conditions. During the COVID-19 shock, HVRP remained stable at 3.12% (comparable to
baseline), suggesting that the HVRP phenomenon persists even during extreme market stress. During the Donghak Ant Movement, retail-led events
generated 3.53% returns (versus near-zero in normal periods), indicating
that collective action through social media temporarily transformed retail
investors from pure noise traders into meaningful market participants, paralleling Bradley et al. (2023)’s findings on WallStreetBets.
**Implications for Future Research**
Our findings carry important methodological implications. Researchers
studying informed trading must: (1) account for investor heterogeneity rather
than using pooled analyses; (2) employ nonlinear methods (quartile sorts,
threshold regressions) rather than linear correlation; and (3) normalize trading activity by economically meaningful benchmarks (firm size) rather than
daily flow measures. The failure to do so may explain why some prior studies
found weak or inconsistent results.
For practitioners, the monotonic conviction-return relationship provides
actionable signals. Abnormal volume events where institutions take large positions relative to firm size (high Q4 conviction) predict substantial outperformance (+12.12% over 50 days), while events dominated by retail trading
provide no predictive signal regardless of conviction level. The ability to distinguish information from noise—and measure conviction correctly—remains
a core competency in modern markets.
**Final Reflection**
Twenty years after An et al. (2006) proposed the investor type hypothesis
as an untested conjecture, we provide the first comprehensive empirical test
using actual investor-level data. The HVRP phenomenon persists robustly
in modern markets, but its drivers are more nuanced than previously understood. Both "who" trades (identity) and "how much" they trade (intensity)
matter profoundly, but detecting the intensity effect requires proper measurement. This study transforms the narrative from "identity matters, intensity
doesn’t" to "identity matters, and intensity matters enormously when mea

37


sured as conviction rather than participation." This refined understanding
advances our knowledge of how information flows through markets and how
different investor types process and act on that information.
**Contribution to the Pacific-Basin Finance Literature**
This paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue in the _Pacific-Basin Fi-_
_nance Journal_ regarding volume-return relationships in Asian markets. By
resolving the apparent contradiction between Chae and Kang (2019)’s Korean
LVRP finding and global HVRP evidence, we demonstrate that proper measurement and investor decomposition are essential for understanding market microstructure in retail-heavy Asian markets. The Donghak Ant Movement analysis provides a template for studying collective retail behavior—a
phenomenon increasingly relevant across Pacific-Basin markets where mobile
trading and social media coordination continue to reshape investor participation. We hope this study stimulates further research on how measurement
choices affect our understanding of informed trading signals in the distinctive
institutional environments of the Asia-Pacific region.

persists despite the 20-year gap and market structural changes.

**Key Findings: Phenomenon Persistence and Amplification**
(1) **Robust Replication of HVRP:** The core pattern discovered in the
original study appears identically in the 2020-2024 period. The fundamental
structure—persistent negative CAR before the event day, sharp positive AAR
on event day 0, followed by sustained positive levels—is fully replicated.
(2) **Significant Increase in Effect Size:** Remarkably, HVRP magnitude has expanded in modern markets. Event day AAR increased from
5.056% to 6.153% (approximately 22% increase), and day +50 CAR remained
strong at 3.09% (compared to 3.672% in original study).
(3) **Enhanced Statistical Significance:** With a much larger sample
size (original: 1,360 events →this study: 26,604 events), statistical significance strengthened substantially across most periods. Event day t-statistic
increased from 83.66 to 118.877, enhancing confidence in the phenomenon.
(4) **Pre-Event Pattern Changes:** Interestingly, the pre-event pattern
differs. The original study showed strong positive return on day -1 (2.454%),
while our study shows this effect distributed across days -2 (0.489%) and -1
(0.661%). This suggests faster information diffusion in modern markets leads
to more dispersed investor reactions.
**Theoretical Consistency:** These results confirm that An et al. (2006)’s
interpretation remains valid 20 years later: abnormal volume increases result
from informed investors’ pre-trading, serving as signals of price increases,
with post-event positive abnormal returns reflecting gradual information incorporation. The amplified effects may relate to modern market characteristics including expanded information asymmetry (despite big data/AI
advances, the gap between professional and retail investors has widened),
amplified behavioral biases (social media and online communities accelerate
herding and overreaction), and increased market volatility (ADTV standard
deviation surged from 0.935 to 8.292).


**Appendix B. Appendix B: Firm Size Analysis**


The original study’s key finding was that HVRP appears stronger in large
firms. We replicate this analysis using official Korea Exchange classification:
large-cap (ranks 1-100), mid-cap (ranks 101-300), and small-cap (rank 300+)
based on market capitalization on event day.
**Key Discovery: Mid-Cap Dominance**
Using the three-way classification, we find the strongest HVRP in midcap stocks. Event day AAR shows mid-cap 6.06%, small-cap 6.20%, large

cap 4.41%; day +50 CAR shows mid-cap 4.00%, small-cap 3.10%, large-cap
1.43%. This "mid-cap > small-cap > large-cap" structure differs from the
original study’s "large > small" pattern.
This shift likely reflects 20 years of market structural changes and the
introduction of three-way classification. Mid-cap stocks occupy an optimal
position—receiving institutional attention while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Large-cap stocks face information transparency reducing information
asymmetry effects, while small-cap stocks suffer liquidity constraints limiting
long-term return persistence.


**Appendix C. Appendix C: Market Comparison (KOSPI vs KOS-**

While the original study focused solely on KOSPI, we extend analysis to
KOSDAQ. Differences between the two markets provide important insights

**Key Market Differences:**
(1) **Initial Effect Differences:** KOSDAQ shows stronger event day
AAR (6.50% vs 5.51%), but KOSPI demonstrates stronger long-term persistence (3.67% vs 2.78%).
(2) **Information Leakage Patterns:** KOSDAQ exhibits higher day -1
AAR (0.70% vs 0.58%), suggesting faster information diffusion.
(3) **Statistical Significance:** KOSDAQ shows statistical significance
across more periods, reflecting the higher responsiveness of this small-andmid-cap-focused market.
These differences reflect structural characteristics: KOSPI shows stable,
persistent patterns centered on large-caps, while KOSDAQ shows rapid but
limited response patterns centered on small-and-mid-caps.
