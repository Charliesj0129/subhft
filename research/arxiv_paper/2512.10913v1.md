**Abstract**


Reinforcement learning (RL) is an innovative approach to financial decision making, offering specialized solutions to complex investment problems where traditional methods fail.
This review analyzes 167 articles from 2017–2025, focusing on market making, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. It identifies key performance issues and challenges in
RL for finance. Generally, RL offers advantages over traditional methods, particularly in
market making. This study proposes a unified framework to address common concerns such
as explainability, robustness, and deployment feasibility. Empirical evidence with synthetic
data suggests that implementation quality and domain knowledge often outweigh algorithmic
complexity. The study highlights the need for interpretable RL architectures for regulatory
compliance, enhanced robustness in nonstationary environments, and standardized benchmarking protocols. Organizations should focus less on algorithm sophistication and more on
market microstructure, regulatory constraints, and risk management in decision-making.

**1. Introduction**


Financial markets present some of the most challenging environments for algorithmic
decision making, characterized by high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complex dependencies that traditional methods struggle to capture effectively Cont (2001). The evolution of
financial theory has witnessed a significant transformation from classical approaches to more
sophisticated methodologies that acknowledge the limitations of traditional assumptions. As
documented by Agudelo Aguirre and Agudelo Aguirre Agudelo Aguirre and Agudelo Aguirre
(2024), behavioral finance has emerged from the divergences observed in traditional theories
of finance, serving as a supplement to classical finance by introducing behavioral aspects
to decision-making. This evolution reflects a broader recognition that financial markets are
complex adaptive systems where traditional econometric approaches may prove insufficient.
Reinforcement learning (RL), as an emerging paradigm in artificial intelligence, provides
an adaptive, data-driven approach to address these challenges by learning optimal strate

gies directly from market interactions Sutton and Barto (2018). The application of machine
learning methods to financial decision making has gained particular prominence in addressing
what Bagnara Bagnara (2022) identifies as the "factor zoo" problem in empirical asset pricing. This latest development in empirical asset pricing demonstrates how machine learning
techniques offer great flexibility and prediction accuracy, though they require special care
as they strongly depart from traditional econometrics. The integration of RL within this
broader machine learning framework represents a natural progression toward more adaptive
and responsive financial decision-making systems.
The theoretical foundation for applying adaptive learning approaches in finance is further
strengthened by empirical evidence regarding the evolution of market efficiency over time.
Lim and Brooks Lim and Brooks (2011) provide a systematic review of weak-form market
efficiency literature, demonstrating that market efficiency is not a static property but evolves
dynamically over time. This time-varying nature of market efficiency creates opportunities
for adaptive algorithms like RL to exploit temporary inefficiencies while adapting to changing
market conditions. The evidence of evolving market efficiency directly supports the rationale
for employing learning-based approaches that can continuously adapt their strategies based
on observed market behavior.
The application of RL to financial decision making has gained significant momentum in
recent years, driven by several converging factors. First, the unprecedented availability of
financial data, including high-frequency trading data, alternative data sources, and real-time
streaming feeds, provides the rich information environment that RL algorithms require for
effective learning Aldridge (2013); Tsantekidis et al. (2017a). Second, advances in deep learning architectures have enabled RL methods to handle the high-dimensional state and action
spaces characteristic of financial applications Goodfellow et al. (2016); Heaton et al. (2017).
Third, the increasing accessibility and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing resources have
made sophisticated RL implementations feasible for a broader range of financial institutions.
The foundational work in applying RL to finance can be traced to Moody and Saffell’s pioneering research on direct reinforcement learning for trading systems Moody and
Saffell (2001). Their approach demonstrated that RL could optimize trading performance
directly without requiring explicit forecasting models, establishing a paradigm that continues to influence contemporary research. This direct optimization approach aligns with the
broader trend in financial machine learning identified by Bagnara Bagnara (2022), where
methods are grouped into categories including regularization, dimension reduction, regression trees/random forest, neural networks, and comparative analyses. More recently, Jiang
et al. introduced deep reinforcement learning frameworks specifically designed for portfolio
management problems, showing how modern neural network architectures could be effectively
combined with RL principles for financial applications Jiang et al. (2017).
The integration of RL within the broader landscape of financial machine learning represents a significant departure from traditional econometric approaches. As noted in the
comprehensive survey by Bagnara Bagnara (2022), machine learning methods in asset pricing require particular attention to their economic interpretation, providing hints for future
developments. This emphasis on economic interpretability is particularly crucial for RL applications in finance, where the learned policies must not only achieve superior performance
but also provide insights that can be understood and validated by financial practitioners and
regulators.

Despite these promising developments, the practical implementation of RL in finance
faces numerous unique challenges compared to other domains where RL has achieved success
Dulac-Arnold et al. (2019); García and Fernández (2015). These challenges stem from the
inherent characteristics of financial environments: markets are fundamentally non-stationary,
with dynamics that shift due to regulatory changes, technological innovations, and evolving
market participant behavior Cont (2001); Farmer and Skouras (2013). The evidence presented
by Lim and Brooks Lim and Brooks (2011) regarding the evolution of market efficiency over
time further emphasizes the dynamic nature of financial markets and the need for adaptive
approaches that can respond to changing conditions.
The cost of exploration in financial environments can be prohibitively high, as poor decisions result in real financial losses rather than abstract performance penalties. Additionally, financial applications operate under strict regulatory oversight, necessitating decision
processes that are explainable and auditable Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017); Gomber et al.
(2017b). The behavioral finance perspective highlighted by Agudelo Aguirre and Agudelo
Aguirre Agudelo Aguirre and Agudelo Aguirre (2024) adds another layer of complexity, as
RL systems must account for psychological aspects, cognitive biases, and other behavioral
factors that influence market dynamics and investor decision-making.
The regulatory landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for RL adoption
in finance. Recent developments in AI governance frameworks emphasize the need for explainable and auditable decision-making systems, driving research toward interpretable RL
architectures Puiutta and Veith (2020). The evolving regulatory environment requires RL
systems to balance innovation with compliance, necessitating new approaches to model validation and risk management McNeil et al. (2015). This regulatory focus on interpretability
aligns with the broader emphasis on economic interpretation in financial machine learning
identified by Bagnara Bagnara (2022), suggesting that successful RL implementations must
prioritize both performance and explainability.
This comprehensive review addresses these challenges by conducting a systematic analysis of the current literature to identify patterns and insights regarding the effectiveness of
RL in financial applications. The analysis reveals several important findings that challenge
common assumptions about RL effectiveness in finance. The emergence of hybrid approaches
that combine RL with traditional quantitative methods shows particular promise, achieving
significant performance improvements over pure RL implementations Fischer and Krauss
(2018). This trend toward hybrid methodologies reflects the broader evolution in financial
machine learning, where the integration of different approaches often yields superior results
compared to single-method implementations.
Market making applications consistently demonstrate strong performance improvements,
followed by cryptocurrency trading, while traditional portfolio optimization shows signs of
maturation Spooner et al. (2018). The need for robust validation frameworks becomes increasingly critical as RL systems are deployed in production environments where model failures can have significant financial consequences Bailey et al. (2014). The time-varying nature
of market efficiency documented by Lim and Brooks Lim and Brooks (2011) further emphasizes the importance of continuous validation and adaptation in RL systems deployed in
financial markets.
This review delivers contributions in four key areas. Firstly, it presents a detailed classification of how RL is applied within finance, sorting existing literature by application areas,


3


algorithmic strategies, and performance traits. This classification builds upon the categorization framework established in the broader financial machine learning literature Bagnara (2022); Shi (2025), extending it specifically to RL applications. Secondly, it performs
thorough analyses to pinpoint elements that critically impact RL outcomes and provides
data-driven suggestions for professionals. These analyses incorporate insights from the evolution of market efficiency Lim and Brooks (2011) and behavioral finance considerations
Agudelo Aguirre and Agudelo Aguirre (2024) to provide a comprehensive understanding of
the factors influencing RL performance in financial contexts.
Thirdly, the issue of proprietary performance data in finance is tackled by rigorously
examining publicly accessible studies. This approach addresses one of the key challenges in
financial machine learning research, where the proprietary nature of trading strategies and
performance data often limits the availability of comprehensive empirical evidence. Lastly, it
suggests practical implementation models that confront real-world deployment hurdles while
adhering to regulatory standards and risk management protocols. These implementation
models incorporate lessons learned from the broader evolution of financial theory and practice,
including the transition from classical to behavioral finance approaches and the integration
of machine learning methods in asset pricing.
The analysis demonstrates that successful RL implementation in finance depends more
critically on implementation quality, domain expertise, and data preprocessing than on algorithmic sophistication. This finding aligns with the broader trends in financial machine
learning identified by Bagnara Bagnara (2022), where the economic interpretation and practical applicability of results often outweigh pure algorithmic complexity. The findings provide
both researchers and practitioners with evidence-based guidance for developing effective RL
systems in financial contexts, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration
between machine learning researchers, financial practitioners, and regulatory experts.
The integration of insights from behavioral finance Agudelo Aguirre and Agudelo Aguirre
(2024) and market efficiency evolution Lim and Brooks (2011) provides a more comprehensive foundation for understanding the role of RL in financial decision making. This interdisciplinary approach recognizes that successful RL implementations must account for the
complex interplay between market dynamics, participant behavior, regulatory constraints,
and technological capabilities. The evidence suggests that the future of RL in finance lies
not in replacing traditional methods entirely, but in creating sophisticated hybrid systems
that leverage the strengths of both adaptive learning and established financial theory.


**2. BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM DEFINITION**


Reinforcement Learning (RL) in finance adapts machine learning and control theory for
quantitative finance, transforming traditional strategies into adaptive, data-driven models.
To clarify shared concepts and the theory behind financial RL, this section begins with the
fundamental Machine Learning (ML) definition by Mitchell et al. Mitchell (1997) and Mohri
et al. Mohri et al. (2018).


**Definition 1** (Machine Learning Mitchell (1997); Mohri et al. (2018)) **.** _A computer program_
_is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance_
_measure P if its performance can improve with E on T measured by P_ _._

This fundamental idea underlies Reinforcement Learning (RL), a learning approach centered on sequential decision-making, where an agent develops optimal policies by interacting
with an environment. Sutton and Barto Sutton and Barto (2018) define this framework as
follows:


**Definition 2** (Reinforcement Learning Sutton and Barto (2018)) **.** _Reinforcement Learning_
_is a computational approach to learning from interaction, where an agent learns to make_
_decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward over time._


The shift from ML to RL is crucial for financial decision making due to the complex
nature of financial markets, which involve high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complex
dependencies. The goal is to optimize investment strategies, portfolio allocations, and trading
decisions to maximize risk-adjusted returns while adhering to constraints and regulations.
The formal RL framework is defined in the context of a Markov Decision Process (MDP),
which provides the mathematical foundation for modeling sequential decision making under
uncertainty. The financial RL framework is defined as follows.


**Definition 3** (Financial Markov Decision Process) **.** _A Financial Markov Decision Process_
_is defined as a tuple_ ( _S, A, P, R, γ_ ) _, where:_


  - _S is the state space representing relevant market information, portfolio positions, and_
_environmental conditions_


  - _A is the action space of possible trading decisions, allocation changes, or strategic_
_choices_


  - _P_ : _S × A × S →_ [0 _,_ 1] _represents the transition probabilities between market states_


  - _R_ : _S × A →_ R _is the reward function encoding investment objectives and risk consid-_
_erations_


  - _γ ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _is the discount factor for future expected rewards_


In financial applications, the state space _S_ comprises diverse information sources, carefully engineered to reflect market dynamics and remain computationally feasible. Effective
representations merge multiple hierarchies: foundational price-based features, technical indicators from price and volume, fundamental data on company and economy, and alternative
data for extra insights. The state space’s dimensionality and composition crucially affect RL
systems’ learning efficiency and implementation.
The action space _A_ varies widely in financial applications, mirroring the diversity in
financial decision-making. In portfolio optimization, actions represent portfolio weights or
allocation changes, typically constrained by regulations and risk management. Algorithmic
trading might use discrete action spaces for buy, sell, or hold decisions, or continuous ones for
order sizes and timing. Market making often relies on continuous action spaces for bid-ask
spread adjustments and inventory management. Choosing between discrete and continuous
action spaces significantly affects algorithm selection, convergence, and performance.
The reward function _R_ is crucial and complex in financial RL, needing to encode investment objectives while balancing various factors. Effective functions must incorporate return


5


maximization, risk control, transaction cost reduction, regulatory compliance, and market
impact. Designing them requires domain expertise and attention to the specific financial
context.


**Definition 4** (Financial Reward Function) **.** _A Financial Reward Function R_ ( _st, at_ ) _at time_
_t typically incorporates multiple components:_


_R_ ( _st, at_ ) = _α · Rreturn_ ( _st, at_ ) _−_ _β · Rrisk_ ( _st, at_ ) _−_ _γ · Rcost_ ( _st, at_ ) + _δ · Rcompliance_ ( _st, at_ )


_where α, β, γ, δ are weighting parameters that balance different objectives._


The policy _π_ : _S →_ _A_ represents the decision-making strategy that maps market states
to actions. In financial contexts, the policy must be robust to market volatility, adaptable
to changing conditions, and interpretable for regulatory compliance. The optimal policy _π_ _[∗]_

maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward:







_π_ _[∗]_ = arg max E
_π_




- _∞_


_γ_ _[t]_ _R_ ( _st, at_ ) _|π_

_t_ =0



The value function _V_ _[π]_ ( _s_ ) represents the expected cumulative reward from state _s_ following
policy _π_, while the action-value function _Q_ _[π]_ ( _s, a_ ) represents the expected cumulative reward
from taking action _a_ in state _s_ and then following policy _π_ . These functions satisfy the
Bellman equations:








           
_R_ ( _s, a_ ) + _γ_ - _P_ ( _s_ _[′]_ _|s, a_ ) _V_ _[π]_ ( _s_ _[′]_ )


_s_ _[′]_



_V_ _[π]_ ( _s_ ) = E _a∼π_ ( _s_ )



_Q_ _[π]_ ( _s, a_ ) = _R_ ( _s, a_ ) + _γ_ - _P_ ( _s_ _[′]_ _|s, a_ ) _V_ _[π]_ ( _s_ _[′]_ )

_2.1. Theoretical Foundations of RL Algorithms in Financial Decision Making_
The landscape of RL algorithms applicable to financial decision making can be systematically categorized based on their fundamental learning paradigms and architectural characteristics. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for understanding the strengths,
limitations, and appropriate applications of different algorithmic approaches in financial contexts.
Value-based methods form the foundation of many financial RL applications, particularly
those involving discrete decision spaces. These algorithms learn value functions that approximate the expected return of state-action pairs, enabling optimal decision making through
value maximization. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and their extensions represent the most widely
adopted value-based approaches in financial applications.


**Definition 5** (Q-Learning for Financial Applications) **.** _The Q-learning update rule for fi-_
_nancial decision making is given by:_


                  -                   _Q_ ( _st, at_ ) _←_ _Q_ ( _st, at_ ) + _α_ _rt_ +1 + _γ_ max _Q_ ( _st_ +1 _, a_ _[′]_ ) _−_ _Q_ ( _st, at_ )
_a_ _[′]_


_where α is the learning rate, rt_ +1 _is the immediate financial reward, and γ is the discount_
_factor._

Policy-based methods learn optimal policy functions that map states directly to actions,
making them particularly suitable for continuous action spaces common in portfolio optimization and market making applications. Policy gradient methods optimize the policy
parameters directly by following the gradient of expected returns.


**Definition 6** (Policy Gradient for Financial Applications) **.** _The policy gradient theorem for_
_financial RL is expressed as:_







_∇θJ_ ( _θ_ ) = E _πθ_




- _T_

- _∇θ_ log _πθ_ ( _at|st_ ) _· Gt_


_t_ =0



_where J_ ( _θ_ ) _is the expected return, πθ is the parameterized policy, and Gt is the return from_
_time t._


Actor-critic methods combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based approaches by maintaining separate networks for policy estimation (actor) and value function
approximation (critic). These methods have shown particular effectiveness in financial applications requiring continuous control and stable learning. Model-based methods learn explicit
models of market dynamics and use these models for planning and decision making. While
less common in financial applications due to the difficulty of accurately modeling market dynamics, these approaches offer advantages in terms of sample efficiency and interpretability.
Multi-agent RL addresses scenarios with multiple interacting participants, which is particularly relevant for financial markets where multiple agents compete and collaborate. These
approaches explicitly model strategic interactions and can provide insights into market dynamics and systemic effects.
Hierarchical RL methods address the multi-scale temporal structure of financial decision
making by learning policies at multiple levels of abstraction. These approaches are particularly valuable for applications spanning multiple time horizons, from short-term execution
decisions to long-term strategic allocation choices.The theoretical convergence properties of
RL algorithms in financial contexts require special consideration due to the non-stationary
nature of financial markets. Traditional convergence guarantees may not hold in environments where the underlying dynamics change over time. Robust optimization techniques and
adaptive learning approaches have been developed to address these theoretical challenges.
The exploration-exploitation trade-off in financial RL requires careful theoretical analysis
due to the potential for significant losses during exploration. Safe exploration techniques, such
as constrained policy optimization and uncertainty-aware exploration, provide theoretical
frameworks for balancing learning and risk management.The sample complexity of financial
RL algorithms is a critical theoretical consideration given the high cost of data collection and
experimentation in financial environments. Theoretical bounds on sample complexity and
techniques for improving sample efficiency are essential for practical implementation. The
generalization properties of financial RL systems are particularly important given the need
to perform well on unseen market conditions. Theoretical frameworks for understanding
and improving generalization in non-stationary environments are active areas of research.
This comprehensive background and problem definition establishes the theoretical foundation
necessary for understanding the challenges, opportunities, and methodological considerations
involved in applying reinforcement learning to financial decision making. The systematic
implementation challenges and practical considerations are analyzed in detail in Section 8.

**3. Methodology**


This section outlines the systematic methodology employed to conduct a comprehensive
review of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision making. The review follows
established guidelines for systematic literature reviews in information systems research and
adopts a structured approach to ensure reproducibility and minimize selection bias.


_3.1. Research Questions_
The systematic review is guided by several research questions: RQ1 focuses on identifying the current applications of reinforcement learning in financial decision making and
their distribution across different financial domains. RQ2 examines the most commonly employed reinforcement learning algorithms and methodologies in financial applications and
their relative performance characteristics. RQ3 analyzes the key factors that influence the
performance of reinforcement learning systems in financial environments. RQ4 addresses the
primary challenges and limitations faced in implementing reinforcement learning solutions
for financial decision making. Lastly, RQ5 explores the emerging trends and future research
directions in the application of reinforcement learning to finance.


_3.2. Search Strategy and Data Sources_
To identify relevant literature published between January 2020 and December 2025, a comprehensive search strategy was employed. This involved an extensive search across multiple
academic databases to ensure thorough coverage of the subject matter. Primary databases
included IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library. Specialized databases such as JSTOR for finance journals, SSRN for social
science research, and RePEc for economics research were also utilized. Additionally, preprint
servers like arXiv.org, particularly focusing on the cs.LG and q-fin sections, and SSRN Working Papers were examined. Conference proceedings explored included those from NeurIPS,
ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, and the ACM International Conference on AI in Finance
(ICAIF).
The search strategy employed a combination of keywords related to reinforcement learning
and financial applications. The combined search string was:
("reinforcement learning" OR "deep reinforcement learning" OR "RL" OR "DRL") AND
("finance" OR "financial" OR "trading" OR "investment" OR "portfolio" OR "market making" OR "algorithmic trading" OR "quantitative finance") AND ("decision making" OR
"optimization" OR "strategy" OR "policy")


_3.3. Study Selection Process_
The study selection process followed a systematic multi-stage approach as illustrated in
Figure 1. The process was designed to minimize bias and ensure comprehensive coverage
while maintaining quality standards.
**Stage 1: Initial Search and Deduplication** The initial search across all databases
yielded 2,847 potentially relevant publications. After removing duplicates using both automated tools and manual verification, 1,923 unique publications remained for further screening.
**Stage 2:** **Title and Abstract Screening** Two independent reviewers screened the
titles and abstracts of all 1,923 publications against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Figure 1: Methodology for systematic selection of articles for the review. The flowchart illustrates the fourstage systematic review process following PRISMA guidelines, showing the number of studies at each stage
and the reasons for exclusion. The process resulted in 167 high-quality studies included in the final metaanalysis.


Disagreements were resolved through discussion and, when necessary, consultation with a
third reviewer. This stage resulted in the exclusion of 1,456 publications that did not meet
the relevance criteria, leaving 467 publications for full-text review.
**Stage 3: Full-Text Assessment** The remaining 467 publications underwent full-text
assessment for eligibility. This stage involved detailed examination of methodology, contribution, and relevance to the research questions. Publications were excluded if they lacked
sufficient technical detail, did not present novel contributions, or did not adequately address
financial applications. This process resulted in the exclusion of 300 additional publications.
**Stage 4: Quality Assessment and Final Selection** The remaining 167 publications
were assessed using quality criteria adapted from established frameworks for systematic reviews in information systems research. All publications met the quality threshold and were


9


included in the final review.


_3.4. Empirical Validation Framework_
To validate the meta-analysis findings, a synthetic dataset was developed that reproduces key statistical patterns observed in the literature. This empirical validation approach
addresses the challenge of confidential performance data in financial applications while enabling rigorous statistical analysis of factors influencing RL performance. The synthetic
dataset includes 167 studies with variables representing feature dimensions, number of assets, training periods, algorithm types, application domains, and performance metrics. The
data generation process preserves the statistical relationships observed in the literature while
enabling controlled analysis of performance drivers.


**4. Applications of RL in Financial Domains**


_4.1. Portfolio Management and Optimization_
Portfolio management is well-suited for RL in finance due to its sequential nature. The
review of 45 publications shows that RL methods generally outperform traditional methods
with modest gains. In Table 2, hybrid approaches like LSTM-DDPG demonstrate moderate
to high performance by integrating fundamental and technical data. In portfolio management, RL often views the problem as an MDP, with states reflecting market conditions and
portfolio attributes, actions as allocation choices, and rewards as risk-adjusted returns. State
spaces may include current and historical price data, price-based technical indicators, company fundamentals, and macroeconomic factors. The dimensionality varies in the literature,
from single price-dimension features to complex multi-modal data sets. Recent portfolio optimization research focuses on incorporating realistic limitations, such as transaction costs,
into RL frameworks. Mean-variance optimizations often yield high turnover rates, which are
unrealistic market assumptions. The RL approach enables objective optimization by considering transaction costs and market impact constraints through explicit reward structure
constraints, along with legal and regulatory constraints using effectively designed reward
functions.
Due to DDPG’s capability with continuous action spaces for portfolio weights, it is utilized
in optimizing portfolio management. As per Table 1, DDPG is an Actor-Critic algorithm,
learning deterministic policies from market states to portfolio weights. TD3, compared to
DDPG, offers similar benefits with additional advantages in reducing overestimation bias and
enhancing learning stability, demonstrated by its strong performance in options trading (see
Table 2).
The meta-analysis in Figure 2 shows that portfolio optimization performance is more
influenced by feature quality than quantity, with a weak correlation between dimensionality
and RL improvements (slope = 0.171, p-value = 0.499). Additionally, RL benefits do not
scale significantly with increased asset complexity (slope = 0.010, p-value = 0.362), highlighting RL’s adaptive learning as a key advantage. Table 3 shows the evolution of portfolio
management applications, with deep RL frameworks enhancing performance and risk-return
optimization. Table 4 outlines challenges like managing multi-asset complexity via hierarchical decomposition and addressing scalability in high-dimensional states with feature selection


10


and dimensionality reduction. Table 5 shows that LSTM-RL methods significantly outperform pure RL in portfolio optimization, demonstrating the benefits of integrating temporal
modeling with reinforcement learning for portfolio management.


_4.2. Algorithmic Trading and Execution_
The literature review found that algorithmic trading, with 62 publications on highfrequency trading, momentum strategies, and execution optimization, was the largest category. Performance improvements surpassed those in corporate risk management and portfolio
optimization, with most reporting substantial outperformance over traditional methods. Table 2 shows that deep RL methods like PPO, SAC, and Rainbow DQN achieved high to
moderate-high performance in algorithmic trading.
HFT applications leverage RL to swiftly adapt to market microstructure changes by
identifying short-term patterns missed by traditional approaches. The state space includes
the order book, recent price movements, and microstructure indicators like bid-ask spreads
and trading volumes. Actions are discrete, involving decisions to place, modify, or cancel
orders.
The DQN algorithms are highly effective in HFT applications, as they manage discrete
action spaces and learn from complex patterns in high-dimensional states. As shown in Table 1, DQN, DDQN, and Rainbow DQN excel in discrete trading and high-frequency trading,
offering stable learning at medium to high complexity levels. The experience replay in DQN
mitigates the financial markets’ non-stationarity by consolidating previous experiences for
learning despite market changes. Recent advances in algorithmic trading, shown in Table 3,
reveal a shift from basic to advanced deep RL methods achieving better risk-adjusted returns. Implementation challenges, detailed in Table 4, involve handling real-time constraints
via model compression and edge computing, and tackling high-dimensional states through
feature selection and dimensionality reduction.
Figure 5 shows algorithmic trading applications perform competitively, but below market
making applications. Figure 2 illustrates that the choice of algorithm family (Panel f) has
little impact on performance, suggesting that implementation quality and domain expertise
are more critical than specific algorithm selection.


_4.3. Market Making and Liquidity Provision_
Market making applications exhibit the highest performance gains in the meta-analysis,
indicated by the highest RL premium (0.488) in Figure 5. This improvement likely results
from the adaptability and continuous nature of RL methods, which better capture the dynamic market microstructure and efficiently solve complex multi-objective functions that are
difficult for traditional market making methods.
Market making involves managing inventory risk to maintain security levels within a
target range while profiting from the bid-ask spread. Table 2 indicates that DDPG excels
in market making with high-frequency data, making it ideal for bid-ask spread optimization
in continuous action spaces. Traditional market making methods are limited by simplistic
assumptions about bid-ask spreads and inventory control. In contrast, RL methods adapt to
market conditions and manage multiple objectives like bid-ask spread capture, inventory, and
risk. Table 1 indicates that DDPG from the Actor-Critic family excels with high performance
and medium-high complexity, making it ideal for continuous action spaces in market making.

Table 6 shows that market making is a key hub for transferring techniques to other financial areas, with strong transfer to portfolio optimization, cryptocurrency trading, risk
management, and execution trading. Techniques like inventory management, bid-ask optimization, dynamic hedging, and order flow modeling have been effectively applied in these
domains. Figure 8 shows that market making applications have achieved the highest performance improvements from 2020 to 2025. Table 4 highlights implementation challenges, such
as managing market impact and addressing liquidity constraints, essential for complying with
market abuse regulations and best execution requirements.


**5. Meta-Analysis of Performance and Methodologies**


This section presents a comprehensive meta-analysis of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision making, synthesizing findings from 167 high-quality studies published between 2017 and 2025. The analysis examines algorithmic approaches, performance
characteristics, implementation challenges, and emerging trends in the field.


_5.1. Comparative Performance of Algorithm Families_
The landscape of reinforcement learning algorithms applied to finance has evolved significantly, with deep reinforcement learning methods dominating recent applications. Table 1
presents a comprehensive taxonomy of RL algorithms used in financial applications, organized
by algorithmic family and showing their relative performance characteristics.
The taxonomy reveals several key insights. Actor-critic methods, particularly DDPG
and its variants, demonstrate strong performance in market making applications, reflecting
their suitability for continuous action spaces common in financial decision making. Policybased methods show robust performance in cryptocurrency trading, with PPO achieving high
performance levels across different market conditions. Value-based methods, while showing
more modest improvements, offer greater stability and are preferred for applications requiring
discrete decision making.

_5.2. Comparative Performance Analysis_
Table 2 provides a detailed comparison of RL approaches across different financial applications. The performance metrics represent aggregated results from the meta-analysis of
167 studies, with Sharpe ratios reflecting typical performance ranges observed across multiple implementations within each algorithm-application category rather than results from
individual studies.
Market making applications typically exhibit the highest performance gains, as demonstrated in Figure 5 where market making shows the highest RL premium among all application domains. The superior performance aligns well with the fact that market making
is usually a continuous control problem, and that, of course, is as tightly connected to the
order book and optimization of the bid/ask spread as it can be. Cryptocurrency trading
applications follow as the second-highest performing domain, likely due to the greater reactive volatility and inefficiencies in these markets, which can be effectively exploited with
RL algorithms. To investigate these performance discrepancies in a systematic way, a formal
statistical meta-analysis of all 167 studies was conducted and the results shed light on what
really matters for RL to work in financial applications. The comprehensive analysis presented
in Figure 2 reveals important insights about the factors influencing RL performance across
different financial applications and market conditions.

learning (RL) performance across 167 financial applications published between 2020-2025.

p-value (0.499) indicate no statistically significant relationship between the number of features used and RL performance improvements, challenging the common assumption that
higher-dimensional state spaces necessarily lead to better results.
Panel (b) analyzes the correlation between RL premium and portfolio complexity measured by the number of assets. The minimal slope (0.010) and non-significant p-value (0.362)
suggest that RL benefits do not scale with portfolio size, indicating that the advantages of
RL may be more related to adaptive learning capabilities than to handling high-dimensional
optimization problems.
Panel (c) compares RL performance between studies using simple return-based rewards
versus shaped reward functions through box plot analysis. The modest difference and nonsignificant p-value (0.120) suggest that sophisticated reward engineering may provide less
benefit than commonly assumed, with both approaches showing similar median performance.
Panel (d) investigates the relationship between training period length and RL performance. The weak correlation (slope = 0.023, p-value = 0.591) indicates that longer training
periods do not necessarily lead to better performance, suggesting that training efficiency and
data quality may be more important than training duration.
Panel (e) examines whether including recession periods in training data affects RL performance. The comparison between studies covering the Great Recession versus those that
do not shows no significant difference (p-value = 0.604), indicating that RL algorithms may
be robust to different market regimes when properly implemented.
Panel (f) contrasts performance between Policy Gradient (PG) and Deep Q-Network
(DQN) algorithm families. The similar distributions and non-significant difference (p-value
= 0.640) support the finding that algorithm choice is less critical than implementation quality
and domain-specific enhancements.
Aligning with the previously determined findings, the results suggest that RL successfulness in finance is mostly the result of implementation quality, data pre-processing, and
domain knowledge instead of algorithmic complexity or feature engineering.
Recent RL studies in finance emphasize diverse methodologies and applications. Table 3
outlines influential studies (2017-2024), detailing notable contributions and outcomes across
financial applications. Key advancements include ensemble methods for cryptocurrency trading, market making optimization, deep RL for portfolio management, and adaptive quanti

potential for performance gains through tailored implementations and high-quality execution.


_5.3. Empirical Validation of Meta-Analysis Findings_
Synthetic data mirroring key statistical patterns was used to validate the meta-analysis
findings, addressing confidential data concerns and allowing thorough statistical validation.
Figure 3 presents the correlation matrix analysis that validates the meta-analysis findings,
confirming the weak correlations identified in the literature review: feature dimensions with
r = -0.0054 (confirming p = 0.499), training years with r = -0.0086 (confirming p = 0.591),
number of assets with r = 0.06 (confirming p = 0.362), and sample size with r = 0.2 represents
the strongest correlation, emphasizing data quality.
Figure 4 presents a feature importance analysis via Random Forest regression. The complexity score (0.31) is the top predictor, signifying implementation quality, followed closely
by the market making domain (0.28), highlighting domain-specific dominance. Sample size
(0.19) emphasizes data quality over algorithm choice, while algorithm family (0.08) is least
important, aligning with meta-analysis results.

Figure 3: Correlation matrix analysis of performance factors in RL financial applications. The analysis
confirms weak correlations between technical factors (feature dimensions, training years, number of assets)
and RL performance, validating meta-analysis findings. Sample size shows the strongest correlation (r=0.2)
with performance, emphasizing data quality over algorithmic sophistication.


Figure 5 illustrates domain effects influencing RL performance differences. Market making
shows the highest RL premium (0.488), confirming the meta-analysis. Small variations among
algorithm families within domains suggest that implementation quality and domain expertise
surpass algorithmic complexity.


_5.4. Advanced Statistical Analysis_
Figure 6 shows the PCA analysis of RL performance factors. It highlights that implementation quality and domain-specific factors are more crucial than algorithm choice, with
the first two components explaining 67% of the variance.
Figure 7 demonstrates the importance of risk-adjusted performance metrics in evaluating
RL applications. The analysis shows that while raw returns vary significantly across applications, risk-adjusted metrics provide more stable and meaningful comparisons. Market
making and cryptocurrency applications maintain their superior performance even after risk
adjustment.


16


Figure 4: Feature importance analysis using Random Forest regression. Complexity score and market making
domain emerge as the most important predictors of RL performance, while algorithmic factors show minimal
importance. This analysis supports the conclusion that implementation quality and domain-specific factors
dominate over algorithmic sophistication.


**6. Temporal Evolution and Emerging Trends**


_6.1. Performance Evolution Over Time_
The temporal analysis of RL performance in financial applications reveals important
trends in algorithmic development and adoption patterns. Figure 8 shows the evolution of
RL performance across different application domains from 2017 to 2025.
The temporal analysis highlights several key trends: Market making applications have
consistently shown the highest performance improvements, with Sharpe ratio increases from
0.35 in 2020 to 0.52 in 2025. Cryptocurrency trading applications have experienced rapid
performance improvements, especially after 2022, due to market maturation and algorithmic
advances. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing has emerged as a highgrowth area, with notable performance improvements accelerating after 2023. In contrast,
traditional portfolio optimization has plateaued, indicating market maturity and the need
for innovative approaches.


_6.2. Market Regime Analysis_
Figure 9 examines RL performance across different market regimes, revealing important
insights about the robustness of RL approaches. Market making applications show particular
resilience during volatile periods, while cryptocurrency trading benefits from high volatility
environments. Traditional portfolio optimization shows more sensitivity to market conditions,
suggesting the need for regime-aware approaches.


17


Figure 5: Performance analysis by application domain and algorithm family. Market making shows the
highest RL premium (0.488), followed by cryptocurrency trading (0.375). Algorithm family differences are
minimal within domains, supporting the finding that domain expertise matters more than algorithmic choice.


**7. Advanced Insights and Comprehensive Analysis**


_7.1. Multidimensional Performance Analysis_
The comprehensive analysis of RL performance in financial applications requires examination of multiple dimensions simultaneously. Figure 10 provides a holistic view of the factors
influencing RL success across different applications and market conditions.
The comprehensive dashboard analysis reveals several key insights: Application domain
emerges as the strongest predictor of RL performance, with market making and cryptocurrency trading consistently outperforming other applications. The complexity score, representing implementation sophistication, shows a strong correlation with performance across
all domains. Sample size and data quality metrics display a consistent positive correlation with performance, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data. Minimal
differences between algorithm families within domains confirm that implementation quality
matters more than algorithmic choice.


_7.2. Network Effects and Emergent Patterns_
The analysis reveals emergent patterns in RL adoption and performance that suggest
network effects and knowledge spillovers between different application domains. Figure 11
provides comprehensive evidence for these phenomena, demonstrating both the quantitative
performance advantages and the structural patterns of knowledge transfer across financial
RL applications.


18


Figure 6: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of features and algorithms. The analysis reveals no clear
algorithmic clustering, with performance variation explained primarily by implementation and domain factors
rather than algorithm choice. This finding supports the meta-analysis conclusion that algorithm selection is
less critical than commonly assumed.


Effective market making has influenced various fields by sharing ideas and methods. As
shown in Panel (b) of Figure 11, it serves as a central hub in a spillover network, strongly
connecting to portfolio optimization, cryptocurrency trading, risk management, and execution trading. Panel e in Figure 11 displays the transfer matrix, indicating strong transfer
strengths from market making to other domains, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, which are notably
higher than other domain pairs.
Table 6 provides evidence of significant spillover between domains, where market making
practices enhanced performance. Inventory management techniques improved portfolio optimization by 12% in risk-adjusted returns, and bid-ask optimization in cryptocurrency trading
increased execution efficiency by 18%. Knowledge transfer mainly occurred from 2020-2022,
reflecting rapid dissemination of market making innovations.
Hybrid methods combining RL with traditional quantitative techniques show a significant
trend, enhancing performance by 15-20% over standard RL. Figure 11 Panel (a) highlights
LSTM-DQN with a 15.4% gain in portfolio optimization, CNN-PPO with a 17.9% increase
in cryptocurrency trading, and Attention-DDPG with a 16.3% boost in market making.
Table 5 shows performance data for eight hybrid methods, with consistent performance
improvements between 15.4% and 19.2% for financial applications. It also lists knowledge
sources, illustrating how computer vision (CNN), natural language processing (attention
mechanisms), and time series (LSTM) were integrated with RL algorithms to enhance financial decision making.
Panel (c) of Figure 11 shows that hybrid approach adoption increased from 15% in 2020
to 42% in 2025, while pure RL adoption decreased from 85% to 58% in the same period.
This suggests the field’s maturation and recognition that combining domain knowledge with
adaptive learning outperforms either alone.
Table 7 highlights that implementation quality (0.92) and domain knowledge (0.85) are
the key success factors for hybrid approaches, while algorithm choice is less important (0.45).
This supports the meta-analysis conclusion that practical implementation is more crucial
than designing sophisticated algorithms. Enhancing implementation quality can increase
system reliability by up to 25% and performance by 5-20% with domain knowledge.


19


Figure 7: Risk-adjusted performance analysis across different RL applications. The analysis shows that while
returns vary significantly, risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe ratios) provide more stable performance comparisons.
Market making and cryptocurrency applications maintain superior risk-adjusted performance, validating the
robustness of the findings.


Table 6 illustrates the systematic transfer of innovations across financial RL applications. The impact of market making innovations on behavior showed the highest transfer
effects. Dynamic hedging, order flow modeling, and bid-ask dynamics were adapted for risk
management, execution trading, and cryptocurrency applications, respectively, resulting in
performance impacts of 5-18%, indicating significant value creation through cross-domain
spillover.
Network effects and patterns impact research and practice. For researchers, innovation
in one area can apply broadly to financial RL, highlighting the importance of collaboration
and knowledge sharing. For practitioners, a hybrid approach combining traditional quantitative methods with adaptive RL is supported, stressing implementation quality and domain
expertise over algorithm complexity.


_7.3. Implementation Frameworks and Practical Considerations_

_7.3.1. System Architecture and Design Principles_
Deploying RL systems in finance requires advanced architectures that meet market challenges while keeping RL’s flexibility. Key principles include modular design for independent
development and testing, layered architecture with data processing, feature engineering, RL
decision-making, execution, risk management, and compliance. The data layer should manage diverse data types and ensure quality and consistency, using distributed frameworks

suggesting market maturity.


for high-volume, real-time applications. Risk management must adapt dynamically to RL
strategies with proper oversight, replacing static systems.


_7.3.2. Deployment and Monitoring Considerations_
Deploying RL systems in production requires specialized strategies for reliable operation and regulatory compliance. Their adaptive nature demands advanced monitoring and
validation beyond traditional financial systems. Real-time monitoring must track execution latency, decision accuracy, and profitability, providing alerts for performance issues or
anomalies. Model drift detection is essential for identifying when RL models underperform
due to market changes or degradation. Validating RL systems needs methods tailored to their
adaptability, as traditional backtesting isn’t suitable, requiring new validation approaches to
evaluate adaptive behavior under varied conditions.


**8. Challenges and Limitations**


Reinforcement learning in financial decision-making encounters fundamental challenges
affecting its practicality and adoption, due to the unique nature of financial markets and the
strict demands of financial applications, unlike other RL domains.


21


Figure 9: RL performance analysis across different market regimes. The analysis shows that RL algorithms
maintain robust performance across bull, bear, and volatile market conditions, with market making showing
particular resilience during volatile periods. This robustness supports the practical viability of RL approaches
in real-world financial environments.


_8.1. Non-Stationarity and Market Dynamics_
A key challenge in applying RL to financial markets is their non-stationary nature. Traditional RL algorithms assume stationary environments with constant dynamics, but financial
markets evolve due to changing behavior, regulations, technology, and macroeconomic shifts
Moody and Saffell (2001). This non-stationarity can degrade RL performance.
Tsantekidis et al. Tsantekidis et al. (2017a) show that changing market microstructure
patterns hinder RL agents’ consistent performance, as strategies optimized for one period
often fail later due to evolving dynamics. Similarly, Jiang et al. Jiang et al. (2017) find that
deep RL models trained on historical data degrade significantly in live trading due to market
non-stationarity. Non-stationarity is exacerbated by adaptive financial markets, where new
algorithms change dynamics and reduce the effectiveness of existing strategies. Farmer and
Skouras Farmer and Skouras (2013) note this "arms race," where popular strategies become
less profitable as they are widely adopted, requiring continuous adaptation and evolution of
RL strategies.


_8.2. Sample Efficiency and Data Limitations_
Sample efficiency is a major limitation in financial RL, as data collection is costly and
experimenting entails financial risks. Unlike domains with cheap simulated environments,
financial RL relies on limited historical data or costly real-world interactions Sutton and
Barto (2018). Liang et al. Liang et al. (2018) address the sample efficiency issue in deep

trends, and risk-adjusted performance metrics.


RL applications in finance, observing that financial institutions hesitate to permit extensive
experimentation with actual capital due to the risk of losses. This restriction curbs RL agents’
exploration, possibly obstructing their discovery of optimal strategies. Complex temporal
dependencies and regime changes in financial data require large datasets for effective learning.
Heaton et al. Heaton et al. (2017) show that deep RL models need more training data than
traditional machine learning for similar performance, highlighting sample efficiency as a key
practical issue. Financial data quality and availability pose challenges. Historical data often
have biases like survivorship and look-ahead, causing overly optimistic backtesting outcomes
Harvey et al. (2016). These issues can heavily affect the training and real-world performance
of RL agents.


_8.3. Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off in High-Stakes Environments_
The exploration-exploitation trade-off poses challenges in finance, as exploration can lead
to significant losses. Random exploration in traditional RL is often unsuitable, favoring conservative strategies in financial settings García and Fernández (2015). García and Fernández
García and Fernández (2015) survey safe reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the
importance of secure exploration in financial domains to avoid failures and significant monetary losses due to random action selection.
The challenge is compounded by financial markets’ extreme events and tail risks, which
are hard to predict during training. Cont Cont (2001) shows that financial returns have

important determinants. The analysis demonstrates that hybrid approaches combining RL with traditional
quantitative methods achieve superior performance while leveraging cross-domain knowledge spillovers, particularly from market making innovations.


heavy-tailed distributions and more frequent extreme events than normal distributions predict, hindering RL agents from learning effective risk management strategies through exploration alone. Researchers have developed safe exploration methods for finance. Moody and
Saffell Moody and Saffell (2001) introduce risk-adjusted measures to penalize excessive risk,
while Almahdi and Yang Almahdi and Yang (2017) suggest adaptive strategies that vary
exploration rates with market volatility and uncertainty.


_8.4. Regulatory Compliance and Interpretability Requirements_
The regulatory landscape for RL in finance poses challenges for responsible innovation
and market integrity. Financial regulations demand that automated trading systems be
explainable and auditable, conflicting with the opaque nature of deep RL methods Doshi

Velez and Kim (2017). The EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)
and similar global regulations mandate that financial institutions explain their algorithmic
trading strategies and ensure they don’t cause market manipulation or instability Gomber
et al. (2017a). This is challenging for deep RL systems, which tend to be "black boxes" with
limited interpretability.
Doshi-Velez and Kim Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017) highlight that in finance, interpretability is crucial because of the systemic risks from algorithmic trading. Financial RL systems
need to not only excel in performance but also clearly explain decisions to meet regulations
and uphold public trust. Interpretability in RL is challenging due to the evolving nature
of policies as agents learn and adapt. Static model interpretability methods may not suit
dynamic RL policies, requiring novel approaches tailored for RL systems Puiutta and Veith
(2020).


_8.5. Market Microstructure and Impact Modeling_
Market microstructure effects complicate high-frequency trading and market making. The
influence of trades on prices, order book dynamics, and participant interactions must be modeled in RL frameworks Cartea et al. (2015). Cartea et al. Cartea et al. (2015) highlight that
overlooking market impact results in poor trading strategies, especially in high-frequency,
large-volume trades. They stress that RL agents need to balance execution speed and mar

ket impact through advanced market microstructure modeling. Market impact varies with
market conditions, time of day, and specific assets, complicating its integration into RL
frameworks. Almgren and Chriss Almgren and Chriss (2001) offer a theoretical framework
for accounting for market impact, but adapting it to RL is challenging due to the complex,
dynamic market microstructure. Spooner et al. Spooner et al. (2018) propose a multi-agent
RL approach to model strategic interactions in financial markets, emphasizing the limitations
of single-agent RL in capturing market complexities and the need to consider participants’
adaptive behavior.


_8.6. Risk Management Integration_
Incorporating risk management into RL is crucial and sets financial applications apart
from others. Static limits and preset scenarios in traditional risk management may not suit
adaptive RL strategies that evolve over time McNeil et al. (2015). McNeil et al. McNeil et al.
(2015) argue that traditional risk management frameworks, suited for static strategies, fail to
address the risks of adaptive RL systems. They highlight the need for dynamic approaches to
manage changing behaviors while ensuring oversight and control. In portfolio management,
RL agents face challenges in balancing objectives such as return maximization, risk control,
and regulatory compliance. Kolm et al. Kolm and Rémi (2019) show that adding multiple risk constraints complicates the learning process and may need specialized constrained
optimization algorithms. The dynamic nature of RL strategies results in changing risk profiles, challenging traditional risk management. This calls for new frameworks specialized for
adaptive RL systems Roncalli (2020b).


_8.7. Evaluation and Validation Challenges_
Evaluating financial RL systems is challenging because of the market’s non-stationarity
and overfitting risks. Traditional backtesting may fail to accurately assess adaptive systems
in dynamic conditions Bailey et al. (2014). Bailey et al. Bailey et al. (2014) show that
traditional backtesting often inflates performance estimates due to multiple testing bias and
overfitting. They note this issue is acute in RL systems, which may adjust behaviors to
historical patterns unlikely to persist.
RL systems have complex temporal dependencies and regime-specific behaviors that are
hard to assess with standard statistical methods. Lopez de Prado Lopez de Prado (2018) suggests advanced backtesting techniques like purged and combinatorial purged cross-validation
for machine learning strategies, but these might not suffice for complex RL systems. Out-ofsample testing in financial markets is challenging due to the lack of independent test data.


26


Financial markets offer a single realization of the stochastic process, making it hard to achieve
statistically significant out-of-sample results Harvey et al. (2016).


_8.8. Computational and Scalability Challenges_
Financial RL systems face deployment challenges, especially in high-frequency applications needing sub-millisecond decisions. Processing large, high-dimensional data in real-time
with low latency is a significant technical hurdle Aldridge (2013). Aldridge Aldridge (2013)
shows that achieving necessary performance in high-frequency trading systems demands specialized hardware and software. Integrating RL algorithms introduces extra computational
overhead that must be managed to stay competitive.
Scalability is challenged by managing multiple assets, time frames, and market conditions
concurrently. Portfolio optimization must account for numerous assets, each with unique dynamics and constraints, necessitating advanced distributed computing architectures Fabozzi
et al. (2010). Training deep RL models is computationally intensive, demanding substantial
resources and time. This may hinder financial institutions from quickly adjusting strategies
to market changes, potentially reducing their competitive edge Heaton et al. (2017).


_8.9. Data Quality and Preprocessing Challenges_
In financial RL, data quality and preprocessing are crucial due to noisy, incomplete data.
Missing data, outliers, and biases can greatly affect RL agents’ training and performance
Tsay (2005). Tsay Tsay (2005) overviews data quality challenges in financial time series,
highlighting the need for proper preprocessing and cleaning. RL applications face acute
challenges due to their sensitivity to data quality, relying on temporal patterns and sequential
decisions.
Survivorship bias is a major issue in financial data, as historical datasets often only
include assets or strategies that have survived, resulting in overly optimistic performance
estimates Brown et al. (1992). This can greatly affect RL agents’ training and their realworld performance. Integrating diverse data sources in different formats, frequencies, and
quality levels poses challenges for RL systems. Sources like news sentiment, social media, and
satellite imagery offer valuable information but need advanced preprocessing and integration
techniques Chinco et al. (2019).


_8.10. Model Robustness and Generalization_
Financial RL systems must be robust and generalize well to handle unseen market conditions and extreme events. Markets can experience sudden regime changes, black swan
events, and other extremes not well-represented in historical data Taleb (2007). Taleb Taleb
(2007) highlights that financial models often overlook extreme events with catastrophic effects, stressing the need for robust design and stress testing. This is crucial for RL systems
susceptible to adversarial attacks or unforeseen market conditions not faced during training.
The generalization challenge is further complicated by constantly evolving financial markets,
with new instruments, regulations, and participants regularly introduced. RL systems must
adapt while maintaining robust performance across various market conditions Cont (2001).
Researchers have proposed techniques to enhance financial RL system robustness, like domain adaptation, transfer learning, and robust optimization. These methods entail trade-offs
in performance and computational complexity, necessitating careful evaluation of application


27


needs Ben-David et al. (2010). This section emphasizes the complexity of applying RL systems in finance, necessitating specialized methods for market-specific challenges. Despite
progress, many issues persist, impacting RL’s practical use in finance.


**9. Future Research Directions**


_9.1. Methodological Advances_
The future development of RL in financial decision making requires significant methodological advances to address current limitations and unlock new capabilities. Interpretable
reinforcement learning represents one of the most pressing needs, requiring the development
of RL algorithms that can provide clear explanations for their decisions while maintaining
competitive performance. Safe exploration techniques represent another critical area for
future research, particularly for financial applications where exploration can result in substantial losses. Future research should focus on developing exploration strategies that can
learn effectively while minimizing downside risk through techniques such as constrained policy optimization and uncertainty-aware exploration. Robust reinforcement learning methods
that can maintain performance across different market regimes and conditions represent another important research direction. Financial markets are characterized by non-stationarity
and regime changes that can significantly impact RL performance, requiring algorithms that
can detect and adapt to changing conditions while maintaining robust performance.


_9.2. Technology Integration and Emerging Applications_
The integration of RL with emerging technologies presents significant opportunities for
advancing financial decision making capabilities. Quantum computing integration could potentially provide exponential speedups for certain types of optimization problems central to
financial decision making, though significant challenges remain in developing practical quantum RL algorithms. Edge computing integration represents a more immediate opportunity
for improving the performance and scalability of financial RL applications through ultra-low
latency decision making and reduced dependence on centralized computing resources. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing represents another emerging application
where RL techniques could provide significant value through optimization of multi-objective
investment strategies that balance financial returns with sustainability objectives.


**10. Conclusion**


This review and meta-analysis of reinforcement learning in financial decision-making offers key contributions to research and practice. Analyzing 167 publications from 2020-2025
and validating with synthetic data, this study highlights patterns that challenge common
beliefs about RL’s effectiveness in finance. The meta-analysis indicates that successful RL
in finance relies more on quality implementation, domain expertise, and data quality than
complex algorithms. Weak correlations between feature dimensionality, training duration,
and algorithm choice with outcomes suggest focusing on domain-specific adaptations and
solid implementation over complex algorithms. Empirical validation supports these findings,
highlighting factors influencing RL performance. Market making and cryptocurrency trading
are key applications, consistently outperforming across various market conditions. Temporal


28


analysis shows significant trends in algorithm development, with ESG investing as a highgrowth area. These findings significantly impact researchers and practitioners. Researchers
are advised to prioritize interpretability, robustness, and regulatory compliance over algorithmic advancements. Practitioners gain evidence-based guidance for algorithm selection,
implementation, and resource allocation.
The analysis highlights key challenges for future research: the need for interpretable
RL architectures, robust exploration strategies, and comprehensive regulatory frameworks.
These barriers to adoption require collaborative efforts from researchers, practitioners, and
regulators. The integration of RL with emerging technologies offers significant potential for
enhancing financial decision-making. The evolution of regulatory frameworks and industry
standards will crucially influence RL adoption in finance. These findings add evidence that
RL is valuable for financial decisions when correctly implemented, but success demands
attention to implementation quality, regulatory compliance, and domain-specific factors.
