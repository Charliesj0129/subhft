We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to
have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point.
We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For
simplicity we consider a 2 _×_ 1 periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal
edge weight labeled _α_ . We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at
_α_ = 3, changing from a topological Z2 quantum spin liquid ( _α <_ 3) to a columnar ordered state ( _α >_ 3).
The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length
_ξ ∝_ 1 _/|α −_ 3 _|_ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin
liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of
loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical
exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.



_Introduction_  - Quantum spin and quantum dimer models [1–7] provide complementary descriptions of strongly correlated phases of matter. In many settings there is an explicit dictionary between the two languages [8–11], with spinsinglet coverings mapped to hardcore dimers on an auxiliary
lattice. Within this framework one encounters a rich landscape
of phases, ranging from ordered states to a zoo of quantum
spin liquids [8, 12, 13]. The latter have been an active topic of
research since Anderson’s proposal of a resonating valencebond state in the context of high- _Tc_ cuprates [14], and were
later placed in a broader theoretical setting by Kitaev, Wen,
and others, linking quantum spin liquids to topics as diverse
as frustrated magnetism, emergent gauge theories, and topological quantum error-correcting codes [15–24]. Moreover,
quantum dimer models can be realized experimentally using
platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays [25–29].


Despite this broad scope, theoretical progress remains hampered by the scarcity of rigorous tools for analyzing these inherently strongly-correlated models. A notable exception is
the construction by Rokhsar and Kivelson (RK) [1], which
reverse-engineers a local quantum dimer Hamiltonian whose
ground state at the RK point is a uniform superposition of
dimer coverings, known as the RK wavefunction. At such
points, equal-time correlators of diagonal operators reduce
to those of a corresponding classical dimer model, allowing
one to import powerful tools of classical statistical mechanics and integrable probability, including Kasteleyn’s Pfaffian
technique on planar graphs [30–33] and its subsequent developments. In this work we generalize the RK construction to
produce local Hamiltonians whose ground states realize _ar-_
_bitrary_ edge-weighted superpositions of dimer coverings on
arbitrary graphs, where a standard RK Hamiltonian can be
defined. This opens the door to exactly solvable models for
a much wider class of spin liquids and ordered phases, as
well as controlled examples of transitions between them. Furthermore, our Hamiltonian construction implies that a vast



number of results derived for classical edge-weighted dimer
models [34–46] are now applicable to a corresponding edgeweighted quantum dimer model. For example, the frozen corners and multiple so-called “smooth” or “gaseous” regions
seen in a 2 _×_ 2 periodic Aztec diamond will also be present
in the corresponding quantum dimer model using our construction. We focus here on an analytically tractable quantum
dimer model on the triangular lattice that exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition between a topological Z2 spin
liquid and a symmetry-broken ordered state (Fig. 1).
_Review of the RK Hamiltonian_  - The quantum dimer
Hilbert space is the span of the orthonormal basis _{|C⟩}_,
where _C_ denotes a dimer configuration. The RK Hamiltonian

[1], written on the square lattice, is


_H_ = _−J_ �□ [ _|_ _⟩⟨_ _|_ + h.c.]

+ _V_ �□ [ _|_ _⟩⟨_ _|_ + _|_ _⟩⟨_ _|_ ] _,_ (1)


where the sum is over all plaquettes (faces) of the lattice. At
the RK point, when _J_ = _V_, the exact ground state is solvable
and is a uniform superposition of all possible dimer configurations. However, in order to witness the rich phenomena
arising in weighted classical dimer models, we seek to construct a generalized RK Hamiltonian whose ground state is a
weighted superposition of all possible dimer configurations.
_Exact Hamiltonian for weighted dimer coverings_  - In this
section, we engineer a Hamiltonian whose exact ground state
can be determined and has dimer coverings appearing with
amplitudes proportional to a product of the edge weights. For
simplicity, we start with the square lattice, but the construction
can be generalized to any graph with an RK Hamiltonian.
Consider the square lattice and denote its set of edges by _E_ .
For an edge _e_ and a dimer covering, let _de_ ( ) denote
_∈E_ _C_ _C_
the dimer number, that is, _de_ ( ) = 1 if edge _e_ is occupied in
_C_
the covering _C_, and 0 otherwise. For each edge _e_, we assign

FIG. 1. The quantum dimer model on the weighted triangular lattice as given in Eq. (5) exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition as
an edge weight parameter _α_ varies. Statistical behavior in the different phases and at the critical point can be seen through the behavior of
random double-dimer coverings in the corresponding _classical_ model, shown here for the 2 _×_ 1 periodic triangular lattice (defined in Fig. 3)
with _α_ = 1 (left, quantum spin liquid), _α_ = 3 (center, critical), and _α_ = 5 (right, columnar order), on an 81 _×_ 81 grid. Double-edges are
shown in gray, while loops are shown in black. In the spin liquid phase _α <_ 3, the double-dimer covering forms many large macroscopic
loops, while in the ordered phase _α >_ 3, there are only small loops and double edges. The ordered phase for _α >_ 3 is a columnar phase with a
nonzero fraction of defects. This loop behavior can be used to intuitively explain the observed vison correlator behavior in the quantum dimer
model. The double-dimer coverings are generated using the Kasteleyn matrix method to compute conditional edge probabilities.

a weight _we_, which can be a complex number. The weight
of a dimer covering _W_ ( _C_ ) is the product of the weights of all
the edges that are occupied by dimers, _W_ ( _C_ ) = [�] _e∈E_ _[w]_ _e_ _[d][e]_ [(] _[C]_ [)] .

We now construct a Hamiltonian whose ground state is


_ψ_ **w** =       - _W_ ( ) _,_ (2)
_|_ _⟩_ _C_ _|C⟩_

_C_


where **w** is a list of weights _we_ . Note that the probability
of _C_ in Eq. (2) is _|W_ ( _C_ ) _|_ [2], rather than _|W_ ( _C_ ) _|_ which is the
standard convention in edge-weighted classical dimer model
literature. For convenience, we use the former convention for
the general construction. Our edge-weighted RK Hamiltonian
having _ψ_ **w** as a ground state is given by:
_|_ _⟩_

_H_ = _J_ - _wp_ _[∗]_ 2 _[w]_ _p_ _[∗]_ 4 _[w][p]_ 1 _[w][p]_ 3 + h.c.
_−_    - _[|]_ _⟩⟨_ _|_

   - _|_ _|_ [2] _|_ _⟩⟨_ _|_ _|_ _|_ [2] _|_ _⟩⟨_ _|_


where the sum is over all the square plaquettes _p_, with _pi_ for
_i ∈{_ 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 _,_ 4 _}_ denoting the four edges of _p_ taken in a clockwise order (see Fig. 2). For _J_ = _V_, analogous to the RK



point of Eq. (1), the Hamiltonian turns into a sum of (noncommuting) projectors _H_ = _J_ [�] - _[P]_ [□] _[,]_ [ where]


   -    _P_ - = _wp_ _[∗]_ 2 _[w]_ _p_ _[∗]_ 4 _[|]_ _⟩−wp_ _[∗]_ 1 _[w]_ _p_ _[∗]_ 3 _[|]_ _⟩_ [ _wp_ 2 _wp_ 4 _⟨_ _|−wp_ 1 _wp_ 3 _⟨_ (4) _|_ ] _._
It is easy to see that _P_ - [2] [=] - _wp_ 2 _wp_ 4 + _wp_ 1 _wp_ 3 _P_ □,
_|_ _|_ [2] _|_ _|_ [2][�]
implying _P_ - is a projector up to a positive scalar factor.
This immediately implies that all the eigen-energies must be
non-negative. Moreover, it can be explicitly checked that
_P_ - _ψ_ **w** = 0, for all _P_ □. Thus _ψ_ **w** is a ground state of
_|_ _⟩_ _|_ _⟩_
_H_ . Note that this construction is very general and applies to
any configuration of weights, which need not be translationally invariant. It is worth noting that _ψ_ **w** is not necessar_|_ _⟩_
ily the unique ground state for an arbitrary graph. However,
since any two dimer coverings of the rectangular grid or Aztec
diamond (or more generally any simply connected finite region of the square lattice) are connected by ring flips [47], the
ground state of _H_ is _unique_ as long as none of the weights
are zero. Any diagonal observable calculated in _ψ_ **w** will be
_|_ _⟩_
equal to the observable calculated in a classical dimer model
with covering weights proportional to _|W_ ( _C_ ) _|_ [2] . We can thus
use results and techniques for weighted classical dimer models to draw conclusions about the quantum dimer model defined above.
_Weighted dimer Hamiltonian for the triangular lattice_  Similar to the square lattice Hamiltonian, we can write a
Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice. The only modification is
that we sum over three kinds of plaquettes. The edge weights
we consider are 2 _×_ 1 periodic, i.e., they are 2-periodic in the
horizontal direction and 1-periodic in the vertical direction.
This allows for six distinct edge weights, two for each of the


orientations horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. For simplicity,
we shall take one horizontal edge weight to be _α ≥_ 0, and all
five other edge weights to be 1 (see Figs. 3 and 4). For these
weights, the explicit Hamiltonian using the above construction is:

correlators can be expressed exactly in terms of the associated
Kasteleyn matrix [30–33] (a specific weighted adjacency matrix; see Supplemental Material) and its inverse [32, 33, 51–
53]. In particular, the dimer-dimer and vison correlators in
Eqs. (6) and (9), which identify the quantum phase, have exact expressions which can be studied analytically as well as
evaluated numerically to high (even arbitrary [54–57]) precision. The dimer-dimer correlator _Cµν_ _[d]_ [is defined as]


_Cµν_ _[d]_ [=] _[ ⟨][d][µ][d][ν][⟩−⟨][d][µ][⟩⟨][d][ν][⟩][,]_ (6)


where _µ_ and _ν_ label edges of the graph. Writing _µ_ = ( _µ_ 0 _, µ_ 1)
and _ν_ = ( _ν_ 0 _, ν_ 1) in terms of the corresponding vertices, _Cµν_ _[d]_
can be expressed in terms of the Kasteleyn matrix _K_ as [52,
53, 58]

Similarly as in the bipartite planar case [34, 35], one can show
the entries of _K_ _[−]_ [1] in the infinite size periodic limit are given
by double integrals of the form

where we use the notation _P_ ( _|ψ⟩_ ) _≡|ψ⟩⟨ψ|_ and the first sum
is over square plaquettes having all edge weights 1 while the
second sum is over square plaquettes having horizontal edge
weights _α_ . The edge weight ~~_α_~~ is used in the Hamiltonian so

_[√]_
that correlations in the ground state are given by correlations
of the classical model with weight _α_ .
_Topological phase transition on the triangular lattice_  - In
contrast to quantum dimer models considered on bipartite lattices [2, 48, 49], the RK quantum dimer model on the unweighted triangular lattice is known to be in a Z2 quantum
spin liquid phase [2, 3, 5, 6]. By considering non-uniform
edge weights on the triangular lattice, we show that the quantum dimer model defined in Eq. (5) undergoes a topological
phase transition from a Z2 quantum spin liquid to a columnar
ordered phase.
The 2 _×_ 1 periodic weights on the triangular lattice were
first introduced and studied for the _classical_ dimer model in
Ref. [50], where the authors studied the amoebas and geometry of the magnetically-altered Kasteleyn matrix [35], showing an associated Chern number change indicates a classical
phase transition at _α_ = 3, although the nature of the phases
and type of phase transition are not explored. In this Letter, we
consider the _quantum_ dimer model on the 2 _×_ 1 periodic triangular lattice, and show that the model undergoes a quantum
phase transition, characterized by the _vison_ correlator, across
_α_ = 3. We note by construction the quantum dimer model

where _qz_ 0 _,z_ 1 is a polynomial depending on the points _z_ 0 _, z_ 1,
and _P_ ( _e_ _[ik][x]_ _, e_ _[ik][y]_ ) is the characteristic polynomial, equivalently the product of band dispersions in the free-fermion picture, for the lattice. This leads to an exact asymptotic expression in terms of sums and products of explicit integrals for
any correlator, which allows for analytic study of correlators

[34, 35, 57, 59, 60]. In particular, for this model we analytically show (see Supplemental Material) that the dimer-dimer
correlations decay exponentially off of the critical point at
_α_ = 3. More generally, in the full six parameter edge weights
case, the dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially away
from the set where one of the horizontal or diagonal edge
weights is equal to the sum of the other three remaining such
weights.
Quantum dimer models can be mapped to gauge theories, in
particular the model studied here can be mapped to a Z2 gauge
theory [20]. Monomers (sites without any dimers touching it)
and visons correspond to the electric and magnetic charges under such mapping. Exponential decay of all dimer-dimer correlators and vison correlators implies that the system is gapped
and is a Z2 quantum spin liquid [8, 21, 22, 61]. The vison correlator, which is a nonlocal string operator, can be written in
terms of _K_ and _K_ _[−]_ [1] as follows. For a fixed path _γ_ between
faces _f_ 1 and _f_ 2 (Fig. 4), consider the edges _E_ crossed by _γ_,
and count the number of dimers present in _E_ . The vison correlator between _f_ 1 and _f_ 2 is _|⟨_ ( _−_ 1) [#] _[{]_ [dimers in] _[ E][}]_ _⟩|_, and can be
written in terms of the Kasteleyn matrix as [57]

FIG. 4. Path in the triangular lattice for the dimer-dimer and vison
correlator calculations. For the vison correlator, the starting face is
shaded, with the “face distance” for faces in the path labeled. We
count the number of dimers crossed by the dashed path from the starting face to the ending face. The relevant edges to count are shown
in bold. For the lattice sizes used in the numerics, this path goes
through the horizontal edges with weight 1. The dimer-dimer and vison correlators behave similarly on the adjacent vertical path which
goes through the edges with weight _α_, as well on horizontal paths.


Having defined the relevant correlators and discussed their
exact expressions, we plot them in Figs. 5 and 6, and summarize the quantum phases of our model as a function of the
parameter _α_ as follows. For _α <_ 3, the dimer-dimer and vison correlators decay exponentially, indicating a Z2 quantum
spin liquid phase. For _α_ = 3, the correlators are critical. For
_α >_ 3, the dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially, but
the vison correlator is constant, indicating a trivial ordered
phase. The analytic derivations of the exponential decay of
the dimer-dimer correlator as well as the analytic estimates of
the real space Green’s function correlation lengths are given in
the Supplemental Material. The diverging correlation lengths
for the dimer-dimer and vison correlators near the transition
point are shown in Fig. 7. The critical exponents _β_ = 1 _/_ 8
and _ν_ = 1 for the transition, which are consistent with the 2D
Ising universality class, are obtained via the finite-size scaling
numerics up to lattice size 1001 _×_ 1001 in Fig. 8.

All correlator calculations are performed using the Kasteleyn matrix method (with standard floating point sparse LU
methods to calculate entries of _K_ _[−]_ [1] ), using exact expressions
Eqs. (7) and (9) for the correlators. We emphasize that while
we present many finite-size numerical results in this section,
by Eq. (8) we also obtain exact formulas for all correlators in
the infinite-size limit, which are given in terms of products and
sums of explicit integrals. For example, the real space Green’s
function or entries of _K_ _[−]_ [1] between two vertically separated
points 0 and _y_ in the infinite-size limit can be explicitly written



with the sign depending on the column parity. The integral
can also be turned into a single integral using contour integration. Sums and products of such integrals determine all
correlations in the infinite-size limit, including dimer-dimer
and vison correlators as seen by Eqs. (7) and (9).
Using this, we analytically obtain exponential decay of
dimer-dimer correlators off of the critical point, equivalent to
the presence of a band gap in the fermion model. Additionally,
we can analytically identify the divergence of the correlation
length for _K_ _[−]_ [1], equivalently for the real-space Green’s function in the free-fermion picture, as _α →_ 3. As detailed in
the Supplemental Material, we analytically obtain the Green’s
function correlation length along a vertical path as

Ref. [59]. A simpler vison correlator constant was evaluated
for the (uniform) RK dimer model on the square-octagon lattice in Ref. [57].
To understand the nature of the phases and explain the constant vison correlator, we consider double-dimer coverings
(see Fig. 1); that is, the union _C ∪_ _C_ _[′]_ of two independent

random dimer coverings _C, C_ _[′]_ . Since each vertex will have
two edges present, the double-dimer covering consists only
of loops and double edges. For critical bipartite lattices, the
double-dimer model is expected to behave as the Conformal
Loop Ensemble CLE4 [62–64]. Here we are primarily interested in understanding the vison correlator in the non-critical
spin liquid or ordered phases. The vison correlator can be expressed in terms of the double-dimer coverings _C ∪_ _C_ _[′]_ as

_f_ 0 _fℓ_ = ( 1) [#][ dimers in] _[ C][ ∪]_ _[C][′]_ [ along] _[ γ]_ _,_ (12)
_|⟨_ _⟩|_ [2] _⟨_ _−_ _⟩_

where _γ_ is a path from face _f_ 0 to _fℓ_ . Since crossing a double
edge does not change the dimer parity, the vison correlator can
be written in terms of the number of loops in _C ∪C_ _[′]_ surrounding each endpoint of _γ_ . As seen in Fig. 1, in the quantum spin
liquid phase, loops are large and complicated, allowing for
many changes in parity along a vison path. In contrast, in the
trivial ordered phase, loops are small and not very common,
appearing similar to numerical simulations of the smooth or

_Conclusion_  - In this Letter, we generalized the quantum
dimer construction of Rokhsar and Kivelson [1] to construct
quantum dimer Hamiltonians whose ground state at the RK
point is an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer
coverings. Using this construction, we then demonstrated the
existence of an exactly solvable topological phase transition in
the weighted quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice,
from a Z2 quantum spin liquid phase to a columnar ordered
phase. We used both analytical and numerical results to identify the quantum phases using the real space Green’s function,
dimer-dimer correlator, and vison correlator. We also noted
that all correlators have exact expressions in terms of sums
and products of explicit integrals in the infinite-size periodicboundary limit. Furthermore, we identified critical exponents
_β_ = 1 _/_ 8 and _ν_ = 1, which are consistent with those of the 2D
Ising universality class.
This work opens several new directions for future research
on quantum phase transitions, topological phases, and statistics of dimer models. A natural question is to study the model
away from the RK point, and to investigate the behavior and


universality class of the phase transition there. Another direction is to develop a general theory and classification for
non-bipartite dimer models, which does not yet exist in comparison to the theory for bipartite models [35]. Further study
of the behavior of weighted quantum dimer models at the exactly solvable RK point is also a promising direction, in particular it would be interesting to identify all possible phases
and topological orders that one can obtain with such models,
for example in the direction of double semion phases investigated in Refs. [65, 66], or using the full six parameters in the
2 _×_ 1 model (or more general models).

of clockwise orientation.

[70] If _z ∈{−_ 1 _, α}_, then _c_ 1( _z, α_ ) = 0 and the denominator is
simply linear with a zero at _w_ = _−c_ 3( _z, α_ ) _/c_ 2( _z, α_ ) = 0. The
contour integral over _w_ is then zero for _ℓ, j ̸_ = 0, which agrees

**Review of Kasteleyn’s method**


In this section, we briefly review the Kasteleyn matrix and some of its properties. For further references, see e.g. Refs. [30,
37, 43, 67]. For a planar graph, one can always define a Kasteleyn orientation [30, 53, 67, 68], which can be defined as an
assignment of directions to the edges so that the number of edges oriented counterclockwise around each face is odd [69]. For
each directed edge ( _v_ 1 _v_ 2) between two vertices in the graph, we assign a positive orientation if it agrees with the Kasteleyn
_→_
orientation and a negative orientation if it disagrees. Recall we consider edge weights _w_ ( _v_ 1 _, v_ 2) = _w_ ( _v_ 2 _, v_ 1) assigned to the
edges of the graph. The Kasteleyn matrix _K_ is a weighted, signed adjacency matrix which can be defined as:



_K_ ( _v_ 1 _, v_ 2) =








_w_ ( _v_ 1 _, v_ 2) _,_ ( _v_ 1 _v_ 2) has positive orientation
_→_
_w_ ( _v_ 1 _, v_ 2) ( _v_ 1 _v_ 2) has negative orientation _._ (13)

_−_ _→_
0 _,_ ( _v_ 1 _, v_ 2) is not an edge







Note that _K_ is skew-symmetric. If the graph is bipartite, then _K_ has a block structure and one can instead consider half-size
Kasteleyn matrices where the rows and columns are indexed by one of the two sets of vertices. Since we work on the triangular
lattice, we will however have to use the full size matrix defined in (13).
For a dimer configuration _C_, the weight _W_ ( _C_ ) = [�] _e∈E_ _[w]_ _e_ _[d][e]_ [(] _[C]_ [)] is the product of all edge weights of dimers in _C_ . By construc
tion of the Kasteleyn orientation, the partition function can be written as [30–33, 68]



_Z ≡_ - _W_ ( _C_ ) = _|_ Pf( _K_ ) _|,_ (14)

_C_



where Pf( _K_ ) denotes the Pfaffian, defined for a 2 _n ×_ 2 _n_ skew-symmetric matrix _A_ as



1
Pf( _A_ ) =
2 _[n]_ _n_ !


The Pfaffian is related to the determinant as




- sgn( _σ_ )


_σ∈S_ 2 _n_



_n_

- _Aσ_ (2 _i−_ 1) _,σ_ (2 _i_ ) _._ (15)


_i_ =1



Pf( _A_ ) [2] = det _A._ (16)


Since the Pfaffian of a Kasteleyn matrix counts weighted dimer coverings for the corresponding graph, it can be used to
calculate dimer probabilities and correlations. To count the number of dimer configurations where a certain set of edges _E_ =
_{e_ 1 _, . . ., ek}_, _ei_ = ( _vi, wi_ ), appear, one takes the Pfaffian of the Kasteleyn matrix for the subgraph with all vertices _VE_ =
_v_ 1 _, w_ 1 _, v_ 2 _, w_ 2 _, . . ., vk, wk_ (and their attached edges) removed. This leads to the Pfaffian form of Kenyon’s formula [62], [58,
_{_ _}_
§6.3],

         P[ _e_ 1 _, . . ., ek_ all occur in a dimer covering] = ( _−_ 1) _[k]_

where the Pfaffian is over the 2 _E_ 2 _E_ submatrix of _K_ _[−]_ [1] corresponding to the 2 _E_ vertices in _VE_ . The product

- _k_ _|_ _| ×_ _|_ _|_ _|_ _|_
_i_ =1 _[K]_ [(] _[v][i][, w][i]_ [)][ is just a signed product of the weights for the edges in] _[ E]_ [.]

As an example, (17) gives the dimer-dimer correlator between dimers _µ_ = ( _µ_ 0 _, µ_ 1) and _ν_ = ( _ν_ 0 _, ν_ 1) as


_dµdν_ _dµ_ _dν_ = _K_ ( _µ_ 0 _, µ_ 1) _K_ ( _ν_ 0 _, ν_ 1)      - _K_ _[−]_ [1] ( _µ_ 0 _, ν_ 0) _K_ _[−]_ [1] ( _µ_ 1 _, ν_ 1) + _K_ _[−]_ [1] ( _µ_ 0 _, ν_ 1) _K_ _[−]_ [1] ( _µ_ 1 _, ν_ 0)� _._ (18)
_⟨_ _⟩−⟨_ _⟩⟨_ _⟩_ _−_

Note this formula has an additional term compared to the bipartite case, where the dimer-dimer correlator is proportional to a
single product of the Green’s function at two points [35]. Equation (17) is also used to derive the vison correlator expression (9)
following [57, §II.B] and using (16).


**Exponential decay and correlation lengths off the critical point**


To study exponential decay and correlation lengths analytically, we consider the infinite size periodic limit, i.e. the lattice is
given periodic boundary conditions and then the size is taken to infinity. As noted in (8) of the main text, in this setting it is
well-known that the entries of an infinite limit _K_ _[−]_ [1] are given in terms of double integrals [34, 35, 53]. To obtain the explicit
formulas for the double integrals, we proceed as follows. From the fundamental domain in Fig. 3, we read off the magnetic
Kasteleyn matrix [34, 35], also considered for the weighted triangular lattice in [50], as




     - _z_ _z_ _[−]_ [1] _α_ _z_ _w_ _[−]_ [1] _z_ _[−]_ [1] _w_ _[−]_ [1]
_K_ 1( _w, z_ ) = _−_ _−_ _−_ _−_

where _P_ ( _w, z_ ) = det _K_ 1( _w, z_ ) = ( _z_ _z_ _[−]_ [1] ) [2] +( _α_ _z_ _w_ _[−]_ [1] _z_ _[−]_ [1] _w_ _[−]_ [1] )( _α_ _w_ _z_ _[−]_ [1] _zw_ ) is the _characteristic polynomial_ .

When _w_ = _e_ _[ik][x]_ and _z_ = _e_ _[ik][y]_ are on the unit circle, this gives

which is also the product of band dispersions for the corresponding free-fermion model.
We index vertices in the triangular lattice by coordinates ( _x, y, t_ ), where ( _x, y_ ) _∈_ Z [2] denotes the translation of the fundamental
cell, and _t ∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ specifies the vertex _v_ 0 or _v_ 1 in Fig. 3. Then in the infinite size periodic limit, (20) implies [34, 35]

where _Qst_ ( _w, z_ ) is the rational function given by the ( _s, t_ ) matrix entries [without 1 _/P_ ( _w, z_ )] of (20). See Refs. [34, §7], [53],
or [57, Appendix] for similar calculations for _K_ _[−]_ [1] on other weighted dimer models.
As before, we consider the correlators in the infinite size periodic limit. The matrix elements of _K_ _[−]_ [1] given in Eq. (22)
correspond to the 2D Fourier transform of a rational function _F_ whose denominator is given by the product of band dispersions
_P_ ( _e_ _[ik][x]_ _, e_ _[ik][y]_ ) in Eq. (21). Using that _P_ ( _e_ _[ik][x]_ _, e_ _[ik][y]_ ) is a sum of two nonnegative terms, we see it can only be zero if _ky_ = _kx_ = 0
and _α_ = 3. In particular, for _α_ = 3, there is a band gap since _P_ ( _e_ _[ik][x]_ _, e_ _[ik][y]_ ) = 0 for all _kx, ky_ [0 _,_ 2 _π_ ], and analyticity of
_̸_ _̸_ _∈_
the resulting function _F_ implies exponential decay of its Fourier transform, and hence of the matrix elements of _K_ _[−]_ [1] . As a
result, using the expression (18) for the dimer-dimer connected correlator in terms of the entries of _K_ _[−]_ [1] shows we must have
exponential decay for _α ̸_ = 3,

_|⟨_ _⟩−⟨_ _⟩⟨_ _⟩| ≤_

where _C, c_ may depend on _α_, and dist( _µ, ν_ ) denotes some distance (such as Euclidean distance) on the lattice.
Next, for _α ̸_ = 3, we calculate the correlation length _ξ_ G for the inverse Kasteleyn limit, which corresponds to the real-space
Green’s function in the corresponding free-fermion model, along a vertical path. We start with the infinite size periodic limit
formula (22), which gives expressions of the form

We consider the decay along a vertical path in the triangular lattice. For example, we can consider fixed _j ≥_ 0, and replace
_e_ _[iℓk][y]_ in the numerator with sin( _ky_ ) _e_ _[iℓk][y]_ ; up to constant factors this corresponds to the Green’s function between two points
separated vertically. The integral (28), with modified numerator, is then the Fourier transform of the function


2 sin( _ky_ ) _c_ 1( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ )                           - _r_ +( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ )� _j_

_−_

for _ky ∈_ R _/_ (2 _π_ Z). The rate of decay of the Fourier transform of _fa_ is determined by the nearest complex zero of _fa_, due to a
Paley–Wiener theorem:


**Lemma 1.** _If f is_ 2 _π-periodic and real analytic with analytic extension to a neighborhood of the strip_ _z_ C : Im _z_ _κ_
_for some κ >_ 0 _, then the Fourier coefficients_ _f_ [ˆ] ( _ξ_ ) = 21 _π_ �02 _π_ _f_ ( _x_ ) _e_ _[−][iξx]_ _dx satisfy_ _{_ _∈_ _|_ _| ≤_ _}_

_|f_ [ˆ] ( _ξ_ ) _| ≤_ _Ce_ _[−][κ][|][ξ][|]_ _,_ (30)

_for some constant C_ = _C_ ( _f_ ) _. Conversely, if the Fourier coefficients have the above exponential decay, then f has analytic_
_extension to the strip {z ∈_ C : _|_ Im _z| < κ}._

More generally, a _d_ -dimensional version can be formulated, see for example, Ref. [71, Lemma 5.6], [72].
Therefore to determine the inverse correlation length of _K_ _[−]_ [1], we locate the zeros of _d_ ( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ ) :=

- _c_ 2( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ ) [2] _−_ 4 _c_ 1( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ ) _c_ 3( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ ), for _ky_ = _t_ + _is_, which are closest to the real line.

When _α_ = 3, we see that _ky_ = 0 solves _d_ ( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ ) [2] = 0. When we perturb _α_ away from 3, this root, which is quadratic for
_d_ ( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ ) [2], will split and move into the complex plane. We look for these roots by Taylor expanding _d_ ( _e_ _[i]_ [(] _[t]_ [+] _[is]_ [)] _, α_ ) [2] as _s, t →_ 0
and _α →_ 3, which gives to leading orders,

_d_ ( _e_ _[i]_ [(] _[t]_ [+] _[is]_ [)] _, α_ ) [2] _≍_ (64 _t_ [2] + 128 _its −_ 64 _s_ [2] _−_ 160 _t_ [2] _s_ [2] )[1 + ( _α −_ 3)] + (16 + 24 _t_ [2] + 48 _its −_ 24 _s_ [2] + 18 _t_ [2] _s_ [2] )( _α −_ 3) [2] _._ (31)

Taking _t_ = 0 so the imaginary part of the right hand side is zero, we solve for the smallest zeros of


_d_ ( _e_ _[−][s]_ _, α_ ) [2] = _−_ 64 _s_ [2] _−_ 64 _s_ [2] ( _α −_ 3) + (16 _−_ 24 _s_ [2] )( _α −_ 3) [2] + _O_ ( _s_ [3] ) + _O_ (( _α −_ 3) [3] ) _._ (32)


11



Dropping higher order terms gives that this is equal to zero for



2( _α_ 3) [3]
_s_ [2] = _−_



(1 + _O_ ( _α_ 3)) _._ (33)
4 _−_



8 + 8( _α −_ 2( _α_ 3) + 3( _−_ 3) [3] _α −_ 3) [2] [= ][(] _[α][ −]_ 4 [3)][2]



Moreover, the numerator of (29) is bounded away from zero, since sin( _ky_ ) has no _α_ dependence, and the other numerator terms
were nonzero for _t_ = _s_ = 0 and _α_ = 3. Thus the distance to the nearest complex zero of _d_ ( _e_ _[ik][y]_ _, α_ ) for _α_ near 3 is _|s| ∼_ 2 [1] _[|][α][−]_ [3] _[|]_ [.]

This gives the correlation length for _K_ _[−]_ [1] (the real-space Green’s function in the free-fermion picture) along a vertical path as

measured in lattice distance. One could also study the correlation length along other paths similarly. We plot the inverse
correlation lengths along different paths numerically in Fig. 9. In particular, this confirms (34) numerically for the vertical path.

the zigzag path drawn in Fig. 4, in particular alternating between columns (for the vertical path) or rows (for the horizontal path). There are
two vertices per lattice square in the zigzag path, accounting for the extra factor of 1 _/_ 2 in the comparison to _|α −_ 3 _|/_ 4. The inverse correlation
lengths are calculated using a best fit regression on vertices _ℓ_ = 40 to 150, as measured from the center _ℓ_ = 0 and ending roughly halfway to
the edge at the endpoint _ℓ_ = 150.

of any of the _Qst_ ( _e_ _[ik][x]_ _, e_ _[ik][y]_ ) in (20). A quick standard estimate shows that if _f_ : (R _/_ 2 _π_ Z) _[d]_ C has Fourier coefficients

**Power-law decay at the critical point**


As suggested by Eq. (18), we see numerically in Fig. 11 the dimer-dimer correlator for _α_ = 3 decays as power-law as well,
although along the horizontal path it appears to decay at a faster power than 1 _/R_ [2] . Note that for the square lattice at criticality,
it is also known that certain pairs have dimer-dimer correlators that can decay as a power-law faster than 1 _/R_ [2] [37, 73].

log-log scale. The best fit curves _a_ 1 _/R_ _[a]_ [2] are calculated over distances up to 100. For the vertical paths, the decay is power law _≈_ _C_ 2 _/R_ [2] .
For the horizontal path, there appear to be different rates of decay (faster decay than 1 _/R_ [2] but still power-law) depending on the path index.


The vison correlator _v_ 0 _vℓ_ also decays as a power-law at criticality (Fig. 12), though determining the critical exponent _η_ in
_|⟨_ _⟩|_
the decay is difficult with only finite-size numerics. It is however plausible that one could have _η_ = 1 _/_ 4 in agreement with the
2D Ising critical exponent, but we note the numerical values can vary depending on the region used for the linear regression. We

The exponent _η_ in the best-fit curve _c/R_ _[η]_ is somewhat sensitive to the precise region over which the curve fitting is done (here we use 5 to

anticipate that _η_ can be determined more reliably using the infinite-size limit integrals in e.g. Eq. (28).


**Double-dimer coverings and constant visons**


In this section we discuss how a phase with only small loops in the double-dimer covering is related to constant vison

where _γ_ is a path between _f_ 0 and _f_ 1. We will consider double-dimer coverings _C ∪_ _C_ _[′]_, which consist of the edges of two
independent random dimer coverings _C_ and _C_ _[′]_ . We can write the vison correlator squared as



_f_ 0 _f_ 1 =
_|⟨_ _⟩|_ [2]







_C,C_ _[′]_ [(] _[−]_ [1)][#][ dimers in] _[ C][ ∪]_ _[C][′]_ [ along] _[ γ][W]_ [(] _[C]_ [)] _[W]_ [(] _[C]_ _[′]_ [)]

Recalling the edges in _C_ _∪C_ _[′]_ form only closed loops and double edges, the parity of # _{_ dimers in _C ∪_ _C_ _[′]_ along _γ}_ is unchanged
if the path _γ_ enters and exits such a loop or crosses a double edge. So the parity is only affected by loops which contain exactly
one of the faces _f_ 0 _, f_ 1. For a face _f_, let _L_ ( _f_ ) = # loops in _C_ _C_ _[′]_ that go around _f_ . Then

_−_



If the loops in _C ∪_ _C_ _[′]_ are all small, such as seen in the ordered phase in the right-mode part of Fig. 1, then this suggests that
_L_ ( _f_ ) should be a local quantity since it only involves nearby dimers in the small loops. Then _L_ ( _f_ 0) and _L_ ( _f_ 1) should be nearly
independent for far apart faces due to exponential decay of dimer correlations, giving



_f_ 0 _f_ 1 = 2(P[ _L_ ( _f_ 0) _, L_ ( _f_ 1) 2N] + P[ _L_ ( _f_ 0) _, L_ ( _f_ 1) 2N]) 1

_≈_ _∈_ _∈_ _̸∈_ _̸∈_ _−_



Letting _p_ 0 = P[ _L_ ( _f_ 0) _∈_ 2N] and _p_ 1 = P[ _L_ ( _f_ 1) _∈_ 2N], this becomes

_|⟨f_ 0 _f_ 1 _⟩|_ [2] _≈_ 2( _p_ 0 _p_ 1 + (1 _−_ _p_ 0)(1 _−_ _p_ 1)) _−_ 1 + _O_ ( _e_ _[−][cn]_ )

= 4 _p_ 0 _p_ 1 _−_ 2 _p_ 0 _−_ 2 _p_ 1 + 1 + _O_ ( _e_ _[−][cn]_ ) _._ (41)

To have this tend to 0 as the distance between the faces goes to _∞_, we need _p_ 0 = 1 _/_ 2 or _p_ 1 = 1 _/_ 2. If we want the vison
correlator to to go to 0 for all paths, then by using periodicity to consider _f_ 0 and _f_ 1 the same type of face, we must have
_p_ := P[ _L_ ( _f_ ) _∈_ 2N] = 1 _/_ 2 for all faces _f_ (in the infinite size limit). Due to gauge equivalence of edge weights [74, 75],
non-uniform edge weights is equivalent to non-uniform face weights. If we have different face weights, or even different face
shapes for more complicated lattices, it seems unlikely that we could have all faces have the exact same probability _p_ 0 = 1 _/_ 2.
For example, with varying face weights, some faces are likely to have a different average number of edges around them than
other faces. Additionally, the condition _p_ 0 = _p_ 1 = 1 _/_ 2 seems very unstable to perturbations. Overall, the above suggests that
we will not have a topological spin liquid phase or vison decay if the double-dimer coverings have only small loops.
We conjecture, due to the square-octagon example [57] and related general double-dimer properties of bipartite lattices [35],
that it may then be the case that periodic bipartite lattices cannot host a Z2 quantum spin liquid phase. We emphasize this
is a different suggested reasoning than the conventional argument for lack of spin liquid at the RK point on bipartite lattices

[2, 48, 49], which argues that such (unweighted) models should be critical. However, this cannot hold for bipartite lattices in
general, as the unweighted square-octagon lattice is bipartite but exhibits exponential decay of dimer-dimer correlators.
