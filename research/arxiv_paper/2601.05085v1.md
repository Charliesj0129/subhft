# Trading Electrons: Predicting DART Spread Spikes in ISO Electricity Markets

#### Emma Hubert [∗] Dimitrios Lolas [†] Ronnie Sircar [†] January 7, 2026

**Abstract**


We study the problem of forecasting and optimally trading day-ahead versus realtime (DART) price spreads in U.S. wholesale electricity markets. Building on the
framework of [9], we extend spike prediction from a single zone to a multi-zone setting and treat both positive and negative DART spikes within a unified statistical
model. To translate directional signals into economically meaningful positions, we develop a structural and market-consistent price impact model based on day-ahead bid
stacks. This yields closed-form expressions for the optimal vector of zonal INC/DEC
quantities, capturing asymmetric buy/sell impacts and cross-zone congestion effects.
When applied to NYISO, the resulting impact-aware strategy significantly improves the
risk–return profile relative to unit-size trading and highlights substantial heterogeneity
across markets and seasons.

### **1 Introduction**


In U.S. wholesale electricity markets operated by Independent System Operators and Regional Transmission Organizations (ISOs/RTOs), trading is organized as a two-settlement
system: a Day-Ahead Market (DAM), in which schedules and prices for the following operating day are determined, and a Real-Time Market (RTM), in which actual imbalances
are settled at higher frequency. The difference between these two prices—the day-ahead
real-time spread (DART)—is a central risk factor for both financial and physical market
participants and can be interpreted as a market-implied forecast error up to an embedded
risk premium [19]. Large deviations often arise from transmission congestion, load forecast
errors, unit commitment constraints, and network contingencies, and they can generate substantial profit opportunities for traders capable of anticipating extreme DART events. Empirical works document that such extreme price movements are short-lived, clustered, and
closely linked to binding network constraints and unexpected demand shocks [17, 4, 21, 23].
In NYISO (New York ISO) and ISO–NE (ISO New England), market participants may
take purely financial day-ahead positions through virtual bidding. An INC trade (virtual

demand) of size _q >_ 0 buys energy in the Day-Ahead Market at unit price _P_ [DA] and sells
it back in the Real-Time Market at price _P_ [RT], yielding a payoff ( _P_ [RT] _−_ _P_ [DA] ) _× q_, while a
DEC trade (virtual supply) does the opposite, yielding ( _P_ [DA] _−_ _P_ [RT] ) _× q_ . Thus, the problem
faced by a virtual market participant is simultaneously predictive and operational:

1. reliably forecast where and when large DART spreads will occur, and
2. translate these forecasts into profitable day-ahead positions under realistic market impact.
A growing literature studies DART spreads and virtual bidding from both predictive
and structural perspectives, emphasizing the role of congestion, risk premia, and limits to
arbitrage in two-settlement electricity markets [19]. Early empirical work documents the
prevalence and economic drivers of DART price deviations and the role of congestion and
forecast errors in shaping these spreads [3]. Subsequent studies examine the profitability and
limits of virtual bidding strategies, emphasizing the importance of transaction costs, market power, and convergence effects. More recently, machine-learning approaches have been
applied to electricity price and DART forecasting, showing that extreme price dislocations
can be predicted with economically meaningful accuracy [16, 9, 24, 8]. From a structural
perspective, electricity prices are often modeled as arising from the intersection of aggregate
supply and demand curves, with local properties of the bid stack governing price sensitivity to quantity shocks [5]. Related structural approaches that jointly model load and price
dynamics for risk management and hedging in electricity markets include [6].
The recent study [9] provides a predictive framework for identifying and trading extreme
DART spikes in Long Island, the second largest zone in NYISO. Their results demonstrate
that spike forecasting is feasible and economically valuable. However, their study has two
main limitations: ( _i_ ) trades are sized using a fixed quantity rather than an optimized portfolio
of zonal exposures, and ( _ii_ ) the strategy is evaluated only on a single zone. Here, we address
the central operational question faced by large traders: how to scale multi-zone virtual
positions when submitting thousands of MWh into the Day-Ahead Market without eroding
profits through market impact.


**Contributions.** This paper extends the framework of [9] in four key directions:


1. **Multi-zone, two-sided DART spike forecasting.** We jointly model extreme positive and negative DART spreads across all NYISO zones, allowing for correlated bidirectional spike dynamics across locations.


2. **A structural, economically consistent model of market impact.** Using dayahead bid stacks, we estimate both system-wide energy impact coefficients—capturing
how net long or short virtual load shifts the DA clearing price—and zone-specific
congestion sensitivities. This yields a linear–quadratic impact model linking trade size
to expected price perturbation.


3. **Optimal scaling of virtual positions.** We derive closed-form expressions for the
profit-maximizing vector of zonal quantities, incorporating asymmetric buy/sell impacts and cross-zone interactions. This allows us to determine how large a trade
should be in each zone, not merely whether a trade should be executed.

4. **Empirical validation at scale.** When deployed on 2022–2025 out-of-sample data
in multiple zones of three ISO regions—NYISO, ISO–NE and ERCOT [1] —the resulting
strategy achieves substantial profitability and remains robust across market regimes,
including the extreme temperatures observed during Summer 2025.


**Model overview.** Our methodology proceeds in three stages. First, we train in Section 3
zone-level classifiers to forecast extreme positive and negative DART events using historical
load, price, and congestion features described in Section 2. Second, conditional on a directional signal, we estimate the expected DART spread and the local price impact implied by
the observed day-ahead bid stack (Section 4.3). Finally, we solve a quadratic optimization
problem that jointly determines the optimal vector of zonal virtual positions, explicitly accounting for asymmetric system-wide and local market impact (Section 4.2). This separation
between signal generation and impact-aware sizing allows predictive accuracy and economic
consistency to be evaluated independently.
Overall, our results show that DART forecasting and virtual bidding must be treated as
a joint problem: forecasts alone are insufficient unless paired with a principled model of price
impact and a rigorous scaling rule. By combining predictive modeling, structural analysis of
bid stacks, and multi-zone optimization, this paper provides a comprehensive framework for
scalable and economically consistent virtual trading in U.S. wholesale electricity markets.

### **2 Predictive Framework and Statistical Model**


This section develops a unified framework for forecasting day-ahead versus real-time (DART)
price spreads in U.S. wholesale electricity markets, with an empirical focus on NYISO, ISO–
NE, and ERCOT. Figure 1 shows the zonal layouts for the three regions.

deciding whether to self-commit in the DAM.

#### **2.1 Data Construction**

For each of the three markets, we construct an hourly panel containing day-ahead and realtime prices, system and zonal load forecasts, and a set of exogenous covariates. These
include lagged DART values (24h/48h), lagged load forecast errors, hour-of-day and monthof-year indicators, holiday/weekend dummies, and seasonal effects. In practice, all features
are constructed using a common set of definitions, lag structures, and calendar conventions
across the markets, enabling direct comparability. All market data were obtained from
the public data portals of the corresponding system operators, namely ERCOT [7], ISO
New England [13], and NYISO [20]. Data access and aggregation were facilitated using the
GridStatus platform ( `[https://www.gridstatus.io](https://www.gridstatus.io)` ).

#### **2.2 Feature Labeling**


As day-ahead bids must be submitted well in advance of the operating day, all predictors are
constructed using only data available strictly before the corresponding Day-Ahead Market’s
gate-closure time:


NYISO: 05:00 _,_ ISO–NE: 10:30 _,_ ERCOT: 10:00 _._


This implies a prediction horizon between 19 and 43 hours, depending on the market, and
ensures that the forecasting exercise is entirely free of look-ahead bias.
Thus, the feature vector _Xt,z,m ∈_ R _[d]_ available at the day-ahead decision time for the
operating hour _t_, in zone _z_ of market _m_, is constructed using only information available
prior to the Day-Ahead Market close and consists of: ( _i_ ) lagged DART values at 24h and
48h horizons; ( _ii_ ) zonal and system-level day-ahead load forecasts; ( _iii_ ) lagged zonal and
system-level load forecast errors; ( _iv_ ) calendar indicators for hour-of-day, month-of-year,
and holidays/weekends; and ( _v_ ) season-of-year indicators (Winter, Summer, Shoulder).
The dimension _d_ corresponds to the total number of covariates after feature construction,
including calendar effects, lagged price and load variables, system-level aggregates, and zone
fixed effects. The exact value of _d_ thus depends on the market and feature availability. For
example, in the NYISO application considered below, this results in a feature dimension
of _d_ = 50, which is significantly larger than _d_ = 9 used in [9]. Specifically, each hourly
observation is represented by a 50-dimensional feature vector _Xt_ . This vector concatenates
four zone-level predictors—day-ahead load forecasts, lagged DART values (24h and 48h),
and lagged load forecast errors—for each of the 11 zones (4 _×_ 11 = 44), together with six
calendar covariates encoding weekend, holiday, diurnal, and seasonal effects.

#### **2.3 Spike Definition and Logistic Regression Models**


Given the DART value at time _t_, in zone _z_ of market _m_, we define binary labels for negative
and positive DART spikes as


_yt,z,m_ [neg] [=] **[ 1]** _[{]_ [DART] _t,z,m_ _[≤−][γ]_ neg [(] _[m]_ [)] _[}][,]_ _yt,z,m_ [pos] [=] **[ 1]** _[{]_ [DART] _t,z,m_ _[≥][γ]_ pos [(] _[m]_ [)] _[}][,]_


where the market-specific thresholds _γ_ neg( _m_ ) and _γ_ pos( _m_ ) are calibrated through exploratory
analysis and validation. These labels isolate the economically meaningful extremes of the


4


DART distribution that are most relevant for virtual trading strategies. Our first objective
is to perform a logistic regression to predict DART spikes.
For each zone _z_ of market _m_ and spike type, we define the predicted spike probability at
time _t_ as


1
_pt,z,m_ = P( _yt,z,m_ = 1 _| Xt,z,m_ ) = _σ_ ( _βz,m_ _[⊤]_ _[X][t,z,m]_ [)] _[,]_ with _σ_ ( _u_ ) = (1)
1 + _e_ _[−][u]_ _[.]_



The coefficients _βz,m_ are obtained by minimizing the following cross-entropy loss for each
zone _z_ :

   -    -    
min _yt,z,m_ ( _−_ log _pt,z,m_ ) + (1 _−_ _yt,z,m_ ) ( _−_ log(1 _−_ _pt,z,m_ )) _._
_β_








- _yt,z,m_ ( _−_ log _pt,z,m_ ) + (1 _−_ _yt,z,m_ ) ( _−_ log(1 _−_ _pt,z,m_ )) _._



_t_



Training windows differ across markets due to data availability (NYISO: 2015–2019; ISO–
NE and ERCOT: 2018–2022), and a separate validation period is used to tune probability
thresholds.


**Model selection.** Before settling on logistic regression, we performed an extensive comparison across several supervised learning methods, including random forests, gradientboosted trees and feed-forward neural networks [11]. While some nonlinear models achieved
marginally higher in-sample classification accuracy, they offered no consistent improvement
in out-of-sample trading P&L. This occurs because the spike events of interest are extremely
rare and the feature set is largely linear in its predictive structure; consequently, more flexible models exhibit a tendency to overfit the noise in the training data and produce unstable
probability forecasts. Logistic regression, by contrast, delivered the most robust and interpretable out-of-sample performance across all three markets, and produced stable probability
estimates that translate reliably into trading signals. For these reasons, all subsequent results
and scaling analyses are reported using the logistic models.

### **3 Empirical Performance of Benchmark Strategies**


In this section, we study DART spreads and the performance of the benchmark spike-based
INC/DEC strategies described below in Section 3.1, across the three major U.S. power markets: NYISO, ISO–NE, and ERCOT. All analyses use hourly data and a common modeling
framework, with separate classifiers for positive and negative DART spikes calibrated on a
validation set and evaluated out-of-sample.
Pooling information across zones is essential in NYISO, where congestion and losses
generate substantial zonal heterogeneity. In contrast, ISO–NE and ERCOT exhibit highly
synchronized zonal DART movements, so that a single representative zone captures most of
the relevant variation.

#### **3.1 Benchmark INC and DEC Strategies**


Recall that _pt,z,m_ denotes the predicted probability of a DART spike at time _t_ in zone _z_ of
market _m_, as defined in (1). In [9], a trade is executed whenever


_pt,z,m ≥_ _τz,m,_


5


where _τz,m_ is a zone-specific threshold. The predictive model used to estimate the probability
_pt,z,m_ of a DART spike, conditional on the feature vector _Xt,z,m_, is trained on a historical
training set, while _τz,m_, _γ_ neg( _m_ ) and _γ_ pos( _m_ ) are selected to maximize P&L on a separate
validation set under unit-size trading and no price impact. All performance results reported
below are evaluated on a held-out test set.
We study two benchmark strategies:


1. **INC-only** : trade when a negative DART spike is predicted, earning _−_ DART _t,z,m_ ;


2. **DEC-only** : trade when a positive DART spike is predicted, earning +DART _t,z,m_ .


These strategies provide a clean baseline for comparing predictive performance across
markets and zones. Building on this benchmark framework, we will extend in Section 4.2
the single-zone trading rule to a joint multi-zone optimization problem with endogenous
position sizing and price impact.

#### **3.2 P&L in NYISO**


For NYISO, we work with hourly data from 2015–2025 across eleven load zones, and focus
the discussion on six large-demand zones: CAPITL, CENTRL, LONGIL, NORTH, NYC,
and WEST. We adopt the chronological split


Train: 2015–2019 _,_ Validation: 2020–2021 _,_ Test: 2022–2025 _._


Separate logistic classifiers are fit for positive and negative DART spikes on the training
set, with spike thresholds and probability cutoffs selected on the validation set to maximize
unit-size P&L. The resulting thresholds used in the NYISO analysis are


_γ_ pos = 5$ _/_ MWh _,_ _γ_ neg = 30$ _/_ MWh _._


We tune the probability cutoffs _τ_ pos and _τ_ neg separately for each zone. For example, in NYC
the selected cutoffs are ( _τ_ pos _, τ_ neg) = (0 _._ 75 _,_ 0 _._ 9), while for Long Island they are (0 _._ 7 _,_ 0 _._ 9).
Figures 2(a)–(d) report cumulative P&L over the 2022–2025 test period for INC-only and
DEC-only benchmark strategies in NYC and Long Island, the two zones with the highest demand. Corresponding results for the remaining zones are presented in Figures 8(a)–(h) in the
Appendix. The figures highlight pronounced cross-zonal heterogeneity: while some regions
exhibit persistent profitability from DEC positions, others display stronger performance for
INC trading.
Tables 5 and 6 (in the Appendix) report cumulative P&L by zone, which we relate
to the yearly mean DART spreads shown in Table 7. Zones with systematically positive
DART averages (e.g., CAPITL or, in earlier years, LONGIL) tend to favour DEC strategies,
whereas zones with negative or mixed averages (such as NYC in the post-2022 period) are
more aligned with INC trading. This structural bias in the DART distribution helps explain
cross-zonal differences in profitability and provides guidance on whether a zone is better
approached with INC-only, DEC-only, or mixed strategies.
Cross-zone dependence remains strong throughout NYISO, as shown in Table 8, but varies
meaningfully across groups of zones. Upstate zones exhibit particularly high correlations in

DART spreads, while downstate zones form a tightly interconnected cluster. This pattern
reflects localized congestion and loss effects superimposed on system-wide price movements,
and motivates pooling information across zones while retaining zone-specific features in the
predictive models.

#### **3.3 P&L in ISO–NE**


We perform a parallel analysis on ISO New England, which consists of eight load zones, using
hourly data from November 2018 to October 2025. DART spreads across ISO–NE zones
are almost perfectly correlated, as we see in Table 9, indicating that economically relevant
variation is predominantly system-wide rather than zonal. To avoid redundant signals, we
therefore conduct the spike-prediction and trading analysis on a single representative zone,
Maine (ME).
Given the shorter sample relative to NYISO, we adopt the split


Train: 2018–2022 _,_ Validation: 2023 _,_ Test: 2024–2025 _._


Separate classifiers are fit for positive and negative DART spikes, with spike thresholds and
probability cutoffs tuned on the validation set. For the Maine load zone in ISO–NE, the
resulting parameters are


_γ_ pos = 2$ _/_ MWh _,_ _γ_ neg = 8$ _/_ MWh _,_ _τ_ pos = 0 _._ 70 _,_ _τ_ neg = 0 _._ 90 _._


Figure 3 shows the cumulative P&L curves for the INC-only and DEC-only benchmark
strategies on the 2024–2025 test period. Overall performance is weaker than in NYISO, with
most profits arising from DEC trades, while INC positions are triggered less frequently due
to both the smaller negative-spike threshold and the model’s lower predictive sharpness in
this market.

#### **3.4 P&L in ERCOT**


We next analyze ERCOT using hourly data from 2018–2025 across its four principal load
zones: North, South, West, and Houston. DART spreads across ERCOT zones are extremely highly correlated (Table 10), with pairwise correlations exceeding 0 _._ 97, indicating
that DA–RT dynamics are effectively system-wide. As a result, all zones generate nearly
identical predictions and trading behavior; we therefore focus on the WEST zone for concreteness.
Given the shorter sample relative to NYISO, we adopt the split


Train: 2018–2022 _,_ Validation: 2023 _,_ Test: 2024–2025 _._


Spike thresholds and probability cutoffs are tuned on the validation set. For WEST, the
resulting parameters are


_γ_ pos = 15$ _/_ MWh _,_ _γ_ neg = 10$ _/_ MWh _,_ _τ_ pos = 0 _._ 75 _,_ _τ_ neg = 0 _._ 90 _._


Figure 4 reports the total, INC-only, and DEC-only benchmark strategy P&L curves on the
2024–2025 test period. Most profits arise from the DEC side, while INC trades perform well
initially but give back a large fraction of early gains.

#### **3.5 Cross–Market Comparison**

Tables 8, 9, and 10 highlight pronounced differences in cross-zonal DART dependence across
markets. In ERCOT and ISO–NE, DART spreads are almost perfectly synchronized across
zones, indicating that DA–RT deviations are driven primarily by system-wide factors. Consequently, zone-level behaviour in these markets is largely redundant, and a single representative zone captures most relevant variation. By contrast, NYISO exhibits substantially weaker
and more heterogeneous cross-zonal correlations, reflecting localized congestion, losses, and
transmission constraints. This structural heterogeneity implies that DART dynamics in
NYISO cannot be reduced to a single system factor, making multi-zone modelling essential.
To provide distributional context for the spike thresholds and trading activity across markets, Table 11 reports empirical DART quantiles on the training samples for representative
zones: NYISO LONGIL, ISO–NE ME, and ERCOT WEST. NYISO exhibits heavier intermediate and upper tails, with substantially larger 90th–99th percentiles relative to ISO–NE
and ERCOT.
Taken together, the heavier-tailed DART distribution in NYISO helps explain its greater
trading profitability relative to ISO–NE and ERCOT: larger and more frequent spikes generate a richer set of economically meaningful opportunities, on which predictive signals can be
exploited more often. Differences in observed INC and DEC activity across markets therefore
reflect both underlying market structure and the predictive sharpness of the model, rather
than spike magnitudes alone.

### **4 Optimal Trading Strategy**


A central objective of this section is to determine how large our virtual trading positions should be in each NYISO zone, once a directional signal has been generated by the
spike–forecasting model. Correctly sizing trades is essential: although DART spreads create strong economic opportunities, large virtual positions mechanically shift the day-ahead
clearing price through both system-level and zonal congestion effects. Hence, to maximize
profitability while avoiding excessive market impact, we require an explicit model linking
trade size to DA price response. The following subsections develop this scaling model, calibrate its parameters, and derive the optimal zonal quantities used in our strategy. For
notational simplicity, we henceforth drop the market subscript _m_, as the analysis in this
section focuses on NYISO.

#### **4.1 Price Impact Model**


Let _Z_ denote the number of zones and let _qt ∈_ R _[Z]_ be the vector of signed bidding quantities
(MWh) at time _t_, where _qt,z >_ 0 represents an INC (virtual demand) in zone _z_ at time _t_ and
_qt,z <_ 0 represents a DEC (virtual supply). For each hour _t_ and zone _z_, denote


DA _t,z,_ RT _t,z ∈_ R _,_ DART _t,z_ := DA _t,z −_ RT _t,z._


The $-per–MWh trading edge of an INC or a DEC trade is then


_rt,z_ [INC] = _−_ DART _t,z,_ _rt,z_ [DEC] = + DART _t,z._


9


If a trade of size _q ∈_ R is executed, the realized dollar P&L for side _s ∈{_ INC _,_ DEC _}_ at time
_t_ in zone _z_ is

                -                Π [(] _t,z_ _[s]_ [)][(] _[q]_ [) =] _[ q]_ _rt,z_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _[−]_ _[I]_ [(] _[q, t, z]_ [)] _,_ (2)


where _I_ ( _q, t, z_ ) is the $-per-MWh price impact imposed on the DA price, depending on the
submitted quantity, time and zone.
Before specifying the price–impact model, we recall the standard decomposition of dayahead locational marginal prices (LMPs). In all U.S. ISOs, including NYISO, ISO–NE, and
ERCOT [15, 12], the day-ahead price at zone _z_ and hour _t_ can be written as


DA _t,z_ = Energy _t_ + Loss _t,z_ + Congestion _t,z._


The energy component is system-wide, whereas losses and congestion vary across zones due
to transmission constraints and network topology. These spatial components are precisely
what generate cross-zonal heterogeneity in DART spreads and motivate a zone-dependent
treatment of price impact in our scaling model.
Virtual demand and supply bids shift the residual demand curve and thus impact day
ahead clearing prices. Following the standard approach [2, 10] in optimal execution and
market impact models, see also [1] for a stochastic control formulation of optimal trading
with price impact in electricity markets, we approximate the zonal response of prices to
aggregate traded quantity _St_ by a piecewise linear function, with energy-impact coefficients
_k_ E [+] [and] _[ k]_ E _[−]_ [, and a separate linear impact from the trade size] _[ q][t,z]_ [ in the specific zone with]
coefficient _kz_ :


_I_ ( _q, t, z_ ) =       - _k_ E [+] **[1]** _[{][S]_ _t_ _[≥]_ [0] _[}]_ [ +] _[ k]_ E _[−]_ **[1]** _[{][S]_ _t_ _[<]_ [0] _[}]_       - _St_ + _kz qt,z,_ _St_ :=       - _qt,z._

_z_


The motivation for the first term is that when _St >_ 0, the system takes a net INC position
and moves along the demand curve, whereas when _St <_ 0 it takes a net DEC position and
moves along the supply curve. Since the slopes of the supply and demand curves differ, their
marginal price impacts differ as well, motivating the use of distinct energy-impact coefficients
_k_ E [+] [and] _[ k]_ E _[−]_ [. We estimate these coefficients in Section 4.3 using aggregate supply and demand]
curve.
Moreover, zones in NYISO differ substantially in their typical demand levels and exposure
to transmission constraints. Large demand centers such as NYC and Long Island tend to
absorb incremental virtual positions with relatively small marginal effects on losses and
congestion, whereas smaller or more constrained zones can exhibit much larger local price
sensitivities. This motivates introducing a zone-specific local impact coefficient _kz_, capturing
how virtual demand or supply submitted bids in zone _z_ affect the spatial components of dayahead prices. In Section 4.4, we calibrate these coefficients using zonal load and price data.

#### **4.2 Optimal zonal quantities with asymmetric energy impact**


Each zone _z_ is equipped with a classifier that outputs the probability _pt,z_ that hour _t_ in
zone _z_ experiences an INC spike (negative DART) or a DEC spike (positive DART). After


10


training on 2015–2019, we tune the decision thresholds _τz_ on the 2020–2021 validation set.
At time _t_, we trade in zone _z_ whenever


_pt,z ≥_ _τz,_


and select the trade direction (INC or DEC) with the larger predicted expected payoff.
Conditional on trading, we next determine the appropriate trade size in each zone. To
this end, we estimate the conditional expected economic revenue on the validation period:


_x_ [INC] _t,z_ := E� _rt,z_ [INC] _| pt,z ≥_ _τz_       - _,_ _x_ [DEC] _t,z_ := E� _rt,z_ [DEC] _| pt,z ≥_ _τz_       - _._ (3)


These zone-specific expected payoffs summarize how profitable INC and DEC trades tend to
be when the model signals a spike and executes a trade. They form the input to the scaling
optimization that determines the virtual position allocated to each zone.
Given a fixed time _t_ and the selected trade direction, we collect the expected payoffs into
the vector
_xt ≡_ ( _xt,_ 1 _, . . ., xt,Z_ ) _∈_ R _[Z]_ _,_


and choose zonal quantities _qt,z_ .
For a trade vector _q ∈_ R _[Z]_, we define the objective function



_F_ ( _q_ ) = _x_ _[⊤]_ _t_ _[q][ −]_ - _k_ E [+] **[1]** _[{][S][≥]_ [0] _[}]_ [ +] _[ k]_ E _[−]_ **[1]** _[{][S<]_ [0] _[}]_ - _S_ [2] _−_



_Z_


_kzqz_ [2] _[,]_ _S_ := **1** _[⊤]_ _q,_ (4)

_z_ =1



which represents the expected price-impacted DART payoff of the trade _q_ placed at time _t_ .
The energy impact coefficient is sign-dependent: we use _k_ E [+] [when] _[ S >]_ [ 0 (net buy) and] _[ k]_ E _[−]_
when _S <_ 0 (net sell).
Fix _k_ E (either _k_ E [+] [or] _[ k]_ E _[−]_ [) and suppose the optimum is interior. The first-order conditions]
of (4) yield the following optimal zonal trade quantities:


_qt,z_ _[⋆]_ [=] _[x][t,z][ −]_ [2] _[k]_ [E] _[S]_ _._ (5)

_Z_



_z_ =1

Summing (5) over _z_ yields the closed-form net position


_Nt/_ 2
_S_ = (6)
1 + _k_ E _H_ _[.]_


We therefore obtain two interior candidate solutions:


_Nt/_ 2 E _[S]_ [(+)]
INC regime ( _S >_ 0): _S_ [(+)] = _qt,z_ [(+)] [=] _[x][t,z][ −]_ [2] _[k]_ [+] _,_
1 + _k_ E [+] _[H]_ _[,]_ 2 _kz_

1 + _k_ E _[−][H]_ _[,]_ 2 _kz_


11


A third possibility is that the optimum lies on the boundary where the net position is
zero, so that the energy impact term vanishes and only local impacts remain. In this regime
we solve

The optimization therefore yields three candidate solutions _qt_ [(+)] _, qt_ [(] _[−]_ [)] _, qt_ [(0)][. We retain] _[ q]_ _t_ [(+)]
only when _S_ [(+)] _>_ 0, and _qt_ [(] _[−]_ [)] only when _S_ [(] _[−]_ [)] _<_ 0. The net-flat solution _qt_ [(0)] is always feasible.
Among all admissible candidates, the optimal trading vector is the one that maximizes the
objective value _F_ ( _q_ ).

#### **4.3 Estimating the energy-impact coefficients**


We describe system-wide price formation in the NYISO Day-Ahead Market using aggregate
supply and demand curves. Let _Q_ [S] ( _p_ ) and _Q_ [D] ( _p_ ) denote, respectively, the total quantity
supplied and demanded at price _p_ . For each hour _t_, the day-ahead clearing price _p_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ ) satisfies


_Q_ [S][�] _p_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ )� = _Q_ [D][�] _p_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ )� _._


Equivalently, defining the cleared quantity


_q_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ ) := _Q_ [S][�] _p_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ )� = _Q_ [D][�] _p_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ )� _,_


the relevant price–quantity relationship is given locally by the inverse supply and demand
curves _P_ [S] ( _q_ ) := ( _Q_ [S] ) _[−]_ [1] ( _q_ ) and _P_ [D] ( _q_ ) := ( _Q_ [D] ) _[−]_ [1] ( _q_ ) evaluated at ( _q_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ ) _, p_ _[⋆]_ ( _t_ )). Our objective
is to estimate the local slope of this mapping at the day-ahead equilibrium. Because the
bid stack is observed only as a discrete collection of bids, we estimate these derivatives
numerically using one-sided finite differences. This approach follows the bid-stack–based
price formation framework introduced in [5], which model s electricity prices as arising from
local properties of the aggregate supply and demand curves.
A net long day-ahead position of size ∆ _q >_ 0 corresponds to an exogenous increase in
aggregate demand. Operationally, the realized cleared quantity becomes


_Q_ [S] ( _p_ [+] ) = _Q_ [D] ( _p_ [+] ) = _Q_ [D] ( _p_ _[⋆]_ ) + ∆ _q_ = _Q_ [S] ( _p_ _[⋆]_ ) + ∆ _q,_


where _p_ [+] denotes the perturbed clearing price. Expanding _Q_ [S] to first order around _p_ _[⋆]_ yields


∆ _q_
_p_ [+] _−_ _p_ _[⋆]_ _≈_ (8)
( _Q_ [S] ) _[′]_ ( _p_ _[⋆]_ ) _[>]_ [ 0] _[.]_


Equivalently, this corresponds to a first-order expansion of the inverse supply curve _P_ [S] ( _q_ )
around _q_ _[⋆]_ . Thus the buy-side price impact is governed by the local slope of the aggregate
supply curve.

We estimate _k_ E [+] [by taking ∆] _[q]_ [ = 1000 MWh and averaging the resulting finite-difference]
price responses across a selected set of hours within each season and Peak/Off-Peak bucket.
Specifically, we consider the Top-10 spike hours ( _N_ = 10). The resulting average buy-side
impacts are reported in Table 1.
Similarly, a net short position of size ∆ _q <_ 0 corresponds to a shift along the inverse
demand curve. In this case, the perturbed clearing price _p_ _[−]_ satisfies


∆ _q_

The sell-side impact is thus governed by the local slope of the aggregate demand curve. We
estimate _k_ E _[−]_ [analogously using one-sided finite differences with ∆] _[q]_ [ = 1000 MWh and the]
same sampling scheme. Corresponding sell-side impacts are reported in Table 2.

The parameters ( _k_ E [+] _[, k]_ E _[−]_ [) should therefore be interpreted as local average slopes of the]
inverse residual supply and demand curves at the day-ahead clearing point. In general, they
need not coincide: supply and demand can exhibit markedly different slopes near equilibrium,
particularly during stressed system conditions. This naturally leads to an asymmetric price
response to buy- versus sell-side shocks.
To capture systematic variation in these slopes, we stratify the estimation by season
(Winter, Summer, Shoulder) and by load regime (Peak and Off-Peak hours), reflecting predictable changes in system stress and bid-stack geometry. In all subsequent optimization


13


experiments, the system-wide impact parameters ( _k_ E [+] _[, k]_ E _[−]_ [) are estimated exclusively on the]
calibration sample (2015–2019) and treated as fixed inputs when constructing optimal portfolios and computing realized P&L over the out-of-sample test period (2022–2025). This
procedure ensures that portfolio decisions rely solely on historically available information
and that all reported profits are free of look-ahead bias. For illustration, in the calibration
sample (2015–2019) the largest buy-side impact occurs during Summer Peak hours, where a
+1000 MWh demand shock raises prices by 34 _._ 64 $/MWh on average,while on the sell side,
the largest impact is observed during Winter Peak hours, where a _−_ 1000 MWh supply shock
lowers prices by 114 _._ 89 $/MWh.
Figures 5 and 6 provide a visual illustration of the local linearity underlying this calibration. For a selection of representative hours, we plot the supply and demand curves in a
neighborhood of the Day-Ahead Market intersection and compare the market-clearing price
before and after an exogenous quantity shock. The dotted line in each panel corresponds to
the local linear approximation used in the impact model, while the displacement between the
pre- and post-shock clearing prices reflects the realized price response to the injected demand
or supply. These examples illustrate how, at the relevant operating point, the bid stack is
well-approximated by a linear slope, justifying the use of a linear impact specification and
motivating the estimation of seasonal and load-regime–specific impact coefficients.

#### **4.4 Estimating local impact coefficients**

To calibrate the zone-specific impact coefficients _kz_, we estimate how forecast load affects
zonal day-ahead prices in the NYISO market through the loss and congestion components
of the locational marginal price (LMP). As a reference, we first focus on the Long Island
(LONGIL) zone, which is both a large demand center and an import-constrained load pocket
in NYISO. Its loss and congestion components reflect flows across multiple upstream interfaces and exhibit substantial non-local transmission stress, making Long Island a natural
baseline for calibrating marginal price impact.
We regress the DA loss-minus-congestion component on the corresponding zonal forecast
load separately for each zone, season, and Peak/Off-Peak bucket. The estimated slopes,
reported in Table 12, measure the average price impact (in $/MWh) of a +1000 MWh
increase in forecast load within that zone. In Long Island, the estimated impact ranges from
4 _._ 95 to 7 _._ 82 in Shoulder, from 5 _._ 06 to 17 _._ 73 in Summer, and from 43 _._ 30 to 43 _._ 63 in Winter,
depending on the Peak/Off-Peak bucket.
Table 13 reports the corresponding average forecast load by zone and season over 2015–
2021. Zones with higher typical loads (e.g., NYC and Long Island) tend to exhibit smaller
marginal price impacts per MW, whereas smaller or more transmission-constrained zones
(e.g., Millwood and Dunwoodie) show substantially higher sensitivities. These patterns are
consistent with localized load shocks being diluted in large demand centers and amplified in
smaller or constrained zones.
Guided by the regression evidence—most notably the relatively small marginal impacts
in large zones such as Long Island and NYC [22, 14], and the much larger impacts in smaller
or more constrained zones—we model the local linear impact coefficients _kz_ as inversely
proportional to average zonal load. Using historical mean actual loads _Lz_ over 2015–2021,
we calibrate
_L_ LONGIL
_kz_ = _k_ LONGIL _,_ _k_ LONGIL = 0 _._ 050$ _/_ (MWh) [2] _,_

_Lz_

so that the overall scale of the _kz_ is consistent with the order of magnitude of the Long Island
Summer–Peak regression coefficients (shown in Figure 9 in the Appendix), while preserving
the empirical ranking of zones by size and sensitivity. This yields the following estimates:


_k_ NYC = 0 _._ 020 _k_ LONGIL = 0 _._ 050 _k_ WEST = 0 _._ 067 _k_ CENTRL = 0 _._ 065 _,_
_k_ CAPITL = 0 _._ 085 _k_ NORTH = 0 _._ 210 _k_ DUNWOD = 0 _._ 169 _k_ MILLWD = 0 _._ 357 _,_
_k_ HUDVL = 0 _._ 105 _k_ MHKVL = 0 _._ 129 _k_ GENESE = 0 _._ 103 _._


Zones with larger average loads (e.g., NYC, LONGIL, CENTRL) therefore accommodate
larger virtual positions with lower price impact, while smaller or more constrained zones (e.g.,
MILLWD and NORTH) exhibit higher sensitivity.
Finally, Table 14 reports average correlations between forecast load and the day-ahead
loss and congestion components across zones. Both components are consistently positively
correlated with forecast load across all seasons and time buckets, supporting the modeling
assumption that higher forecasted load increases losses and congestion in expectation.

### **5 Performance in NYISO**

This section evaluates the empirical performance of the proposed trading strategy when
deployed in practice. All predictive models, impact parameters, and decision thresholds are
fixed based on the calibration and validation samples, and performance is assessed out of
sample on NYISO data from 2022–2025. In contrast to Section 4, which focuses on model
construction and optimal trade sizing, the results reported here reflect the realized interaction
between forecasting accuracy, market impact, and cross-zonal portfolio allocation.
If the expected return in the validation set 2020–2021 is negative, we do not consider
bidding for this zone, since our model was not able to give a successful prediction. Table 3
suggests that we should not consider the North zone about INC predictions and the Long
Island zone for the DEC predictions.


Table 3: Validation period (2020–2021): trade counts, average P&L (USD/MWh), and
eligibility per zone.

LONGIL 316 38.12 1705 -1.07

GENESE 40 12.25 51 13.75


Notably, the optimal strategy does not trade each zone in isolation. While the predictive
model assigns to every zone–hour a directional signal (INC for negative predicted DART
and DEC for positive predicted DART), the executed trades are determined jointly across
zones. In particular, it may allocate a position whose sign differs from the local predicted
direction. For example, it can place a DEC in one zone while taking an INC in another,
even when both zones individually exhibit positive expected DART spreads. This behavior
is driven by the system-wide impact penalty _k_ E: by taking offsetting positions, the strategy
reduces aggregate exposure and associated costs, allowing risk to be concentrated in zones
where marginal price impact is lowest.
As a result, a zone may exhibit negative realized P&L despite a correct directional prediction. To disentangle model accuracy from portfolio allocation effects, we therefore report
results in two complementary views. The prediction view evaluates performance based solely
on the model’s directional signals, while the execution view reflects realized P&L after optimization and cross-zone balancing, where we can see the results in Figure 7.
Moreover, Table 15 reports zone-level performance, while Table 16 aggregates results
across all zones for each test year.

values are in USD.


Table 4 reports, for each zone, the number of active trading hours, the average absolute
position size, and the resulting P&L. The largest virtual positions are taken in Long Island,
which is consistent with its market characteristics: the zone combines frequent and sizable
DART spikes with high average load, implying a relatively low marginal price impact per
traded MWh.
A further validation of our assumptions on the energy-impact coefficients _k_ E comes from
examining trading hours in which the strategy takes its largest day-ahead positions. On
24 June 2025—the most profitable day in the out-of-sample period—the strategy repeatedly
submits large net buy (INC) positions during Summer Peak hours. Using the NYISO bid
stack for these same hours, we recompute the day-ahead clearing price after shifting the
residual demand curve upward by the executed quantity _qt_ of MWh. This allows us to
measure the realized one–sided price impact,


∆ _Pt_ = _Pt_ [DA] ( _qt_ ) _−_ _Pt_ [DA] _,_

The results in Table 17 show that the realized slopes lie between roughly 8 and 41$/MWh
per 1000 MWh. These magnitudes are fully consistent with the calibrated Summer–Peak
coefficients _k_ E [+] _[∈]_ [[34] _[.]_ [64] _[,]_ [ 46] _[.]_ [48]/1000MWh obtained from the perturbation experiments in]
Section 4.3. Thus, the empirical price impact observed during the largest trading day strongly
supports the validity of our linear approximation and our chosen parameter values.

#### **5.1 Selective Spike Forecasting**


On the 2022–2025 test period, the joint model exhibits a highly selective forecasting behavior,
characterized by high precision but low recall, as we can see from Tables 18 and 19. Average
precision is approximately 0 _._ 30 for INC trades and 0 _._ 77 for DEC trades, indicating relatively
few false positives, while recall remains around 0 _._ 04–0 _._ 05, meaning that only a small fraction
of all realized spike events is acted upon. This pattern reflects a profit-oriented design: the
strategy trades only when the model assigns high confidence to extreme DART deviations,
favoring signal quality over coverage.
To assess whether the model is selecting economically relevant spikes rather than arbitrary
subsets of hours, Figures 10 and 11 compare the empirical distributions of realized DART
spikes with those selected by the model. In each case, we compare both against the full
sample of hours and against the largest spike quantiles. Across both hour-of-day and monthof-year dimensions, the model-selected distributions align much more closely with the largest
observed spikes than with the unconditional sample.
This effect is quantified using the Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence, a symmetric and
bounded measure of dissimilarity between two probability distributions. Given distributions


18


_P_ and _Q_ on a common support, define their mixture _M_ = [1]

2 [(] _[P]_ [ +] _[ Q]_ [). The JS divergence is]



JS( _P_ _∥Q_ ) = [1]




[1]

2 [KL(] _[P]_ _[∥][M]_ [) + ][1]



2 [KL(] _[Q][∥][M]_ [)] _[,]_




     - _P_ ( _x_ )
_x_ _[P]_ [(] _[x]_ [) log] _Q_ ( _x_ )



where KL( _P_ _∥Q_ ) = [�] _x_ _[P]_ [(] _[x]_ [) log] - _QP_ (( _xx_ )) - denotes the Kullback–Leibler divergence. We note

that JS( _P_ _∥Q_ ) _∈_ [0 _,_ log 2], with smaller values indicating more similar distributions [18].
In particular,
**INC:** JStop 20% = 0 _._ 039 vs. JSall = 0 _._ 094 _,_



where KL( _P_ _∥Q_ ) = [�]



**DEC:** JStop 5% = 0 _._ 061 vs. JSall = 0 _._ 116 _._


The substantially smaller divergences for the top spike quantiles show that predicted trading
hours are statistically closer to the most extreme realized price deviations than to typical
hours. In other words, although the model captures only a small fraction of all spikes, it
disproportionately targets events that resemble the largest historical DART dislocations,
consistent with the subsequent profitability of the trading strategy.

#### **5.2 Enforcing Directional Consistency**


In the baseline strategy, the portfolio optimizer is free to choose the sign of the zonal position
_qt,z_ so long as the resulting expected revenue (after impact) is positive. As a consequence, a
zone can end up with an executed DEC position even in hours where the spike–forecasting
model indicates a negative DART (and hence an INC position), or vice versa, because the
optimizer may use offsetting positions across zones to reduce system-wide impact costs. To
enforce a tighter link between forecasts and execution, we introduce a side-clipping rule: at
each zone–hour we retain only the signal consistent with the predicted DART sign (INC if
the model predicts negative DART, DEC if it predicts positive DART), and set all conflicting
signals to zero before testing the strategy. This mechanism forces each traded hour to take
positions only in the direction implied by the model’s sign prediction, while still allowing
the optimizer to choose the trade size.
Figure 13 shows that this clipped strategy performs better on the 2022–2025 test set.
The total P&L increases relative to the unconstrained optimizer, and both the INC and
DEC components become smoother and less noisy.
Table 23 reports the per-zone attribution of the clipped strategy. Restricting trades
to the model-consistent direction reduces the number of active hours in some zones, but
the remaining positions tend to have higher average profitability. Long Island remains the
dominant contributor, followed by New York City and Capital, reflecting the strength of
DEC trades in these load pockets.
Overall, the clipped strategy preserves most of the performance of the full optimizer while
improving interpretability and robustness. By aligning trades strictly with the predicted
sign of DART, it reduces contradictory positions and produces a cleaner mapping between
forecasts and executed trades.

#### **5.3 Restricting the Strategy to Statistically Significant Buckets**


We revisit the previous strategy. However, now we split the evaluate our model by seasonality (Winter/Summer/Shoulder months)- and Peak/Off-Peak hours. Then, we restrict


19


attention to zone–season–band buckets that exhibit statistically significant performance in
the validation period (2020–2021). Specifically, we retain only those buckets whose mean
P&L has a _t_ -statistic exceeding 2 and the number of trades is at least 50, corresponding
approximately to 95% confidence against a zero-mean null.
Under this restriction, the universe of traded zones shrinks substantially, as Tables 21 and
22 suggest. On the INC side, only Long Island satisfies the significance criterion, whereas
on the DEC side the retained zones are Capital, Central, Long Island, New York City, and
West. All other zone–band combinations are excluded from trading in the test period.
Figure 12 reports cumulative P&L over 2022–2025 for this restricted strategy. As expected, total profits are slightly lower than in the fully pooled specification, reflecting the
reduced number of traded positions. Nevertheless, performance remains strong, with the
majority of gains concentrated during the large summer 2025 spike episodes.
To assess predictive accuracy, Table 20 summarizes the fraction of trades that coincide
with realized spikes and the frequency with which the sign of the DART spread is correctly
predicted. On the INC side, approximately 27% of trades occur during realized positive
spikes, and the model predicts the correct sign in 41% of hours. By contrast, DEC predictions
are substantially more reliable: roughly 76% of DEC trades coincide with negative spikes,
and nearly 80% correctly predict the spread sign.
Overall, this analysis highlights the asymmetry between INC and DEC signals that we
previously saw on Section 5.1: while INC opportunities are sparse and harder to time reliably,
DEC signals exhibit both stronger statistical persistence and significantly higher predictive
accuracy, consistent with the validation-period evidence.

### **6 Conclusion**


This paper analyzes day-ahead versus real-time (DART) spreads in U.S. organized wholesale
electricity energy markets operated by Independent System Operators (ISOs), and extends
the framework of [9] in three main directions: multi-zone spike forecasting, an explicitly
calibrated price–impact model, and the optimal scaling of virtual positions. Working with
NYISO, ISO–NE, and ERCOT, we construct leakage-free feature sets that respect each
ISO’s day-ahead bid deadline and estimate zone-specific logistic regressions for both positive
and negative DART spikes. The resulting models are deliberately selective: they trade
only when assigned high spike probabilities, thereby prioritizing economic relevance over
statistical coverage.
Our empirical results show that spike predictability is highly heterogeneous across markets and zones. In ISO–NE and ERCOT, DART spreads are almost perfectly synchronized
across load zones, so a single representative node captures nearly all useful variation. By
contrast, NYISO exhibits much weaker and more dispersed cross–zone correlations, driven
by localized congestion and loss patterns. In this environment, multi-zone modelling is essential: different zones deliver structurally different DART distributions and support distinct
INC/DEC opportunities. Long Island emerges as the most profitable load pocket, combining
frequent extreme spreads with high average load, while several upstate zones offer weaker
but still statistically significant signals.
A central contribution of the paper is to move beyond unit-sized, impact-free backtests


20


and to construct an economically consistent link between trade size and expected price
response. Using historical day-ahead bid stacks, we estimate system-wide energy impact coefficients and zone-specific congestion sensitivities, yielding a linear–quadratic impact model
for virtual load. Closed-form expressions for the optimal zonal quantities show that portfoliolevel decisions are shaped not only by local expected revenues, but also by cross-zone interactions through the common energy component. In particular, it can be optimal to take
offsetting positions across zones in order to concentrate risk where marginal price impact is
lowest. Backtests that ignore this feedback either overstate achievable profits or implicitly
assume unrealistically small position sizes.
From a trading perspective, the most stable opportunities arise on the DEC side. Positive
DART spikes (which generate DEC profits) occur more frequently and with greater statistical
regularity, and the forecasting model identifies these events with higher precision. In contrast,
INC opportunities—driven by negative DART spikes—are substantially more lucrative when
they occur, but they are rarer, more volatile, and more sensitive to threshold selection
and market-impact assumptions. As a result, DEC strategies deliver smoother and more
persistent returns, whereas INC strategies contribute occasional but very large profit bursts.
Restricting trades to directions consistent with the model’s sign prediction and to statistically
significant zone–season–band buckets preserves most of the economic value while improving
robustness and interpretability.
Several extensions of this study offer promising directions for further research. First, the
backtesting framework could be enriched by replacing our linear impact proxy with realized
day-ahead price perturbations computed directly from historical bid stacks, thereby evaluating the strategy under the true system response rather than a parametric approximation.
Second, more expressive structural models of market impact—for example, piecewise-linear,
nonlinear, or congestion-regime–dependent formulations—may better capture the heterogeneity of supply curves across zones and seasons. Third, the economic value of the spike forecasts could be explored through alternative financial instruments beyond virtual INC/DEC
trades, such as Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) or other hedging products that monetize congestion patterns. Together, these extensions would move the methodology closer to
a full market-consistent execution framework and broaden its applicability across different
trading environments.
