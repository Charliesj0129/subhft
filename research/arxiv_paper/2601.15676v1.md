### **Abstract**


Deploying Audio-Language Models (Audio-LLMs) on edge infrastructure exposes a persistent tension between
_perception depth_ and _computational efficiency_ . Lightweight local models tend to produce “passive perception”—
generic summaries that miss the subtle evidence required for multi-step audio reasoning—while indiscriminate
cloud offloading incurs unacceptable latency, bandwidth cost, and privacy risk. We propose **CoFi-Agent** (ToolAugmented Coarse-to-Fine Agent), a hybrid architecture targeting edge servers and gateways. It performs fast
local perception and triggers _conditional_ forensic refinement only when uncertainty is detected. CoFi-Agent
runs an initial single-pass on a local 7B Audio-LLM, then a cloud controller gates difficult cases and issues
lightweight plans for on-device tools such as temporal re-listening and local ASR. On the **MMAR** benchmark,
CoFi-Agent improves accuracy from 27.20% to **53.60%**, while achieving a better accuracy–efficiency trade-off
than an always-on investigation pipeline. Overall, CoFi-Agent bridges the perception gap via tool-enabled,
conditional edge–cloud collaboration under practical system constraints.

### **1. Introduction**


Edge audio systems—from on-premise security gateways and smart-home hubs to autonomous service robots—
must operate under strict system constraints. Latency, bandwidth, and acoustic privacy are first-order requirements for real-time applications, ranging from interactive voice assistants [1] to on-premise security gateways.
Meanwhile, user queries increasingly demand _reasoning_ over complex acoustic scenes: long recordings, heavy
background noise, overlapping speakers, and rare but decisive events. Recent edge-AI surveys also highlight
the growing tension between advanced foundation models and the practical limits of resource-constrained
deployments [2].
Most Audio-Language Models (Audio-LLMs) still follow a _single-pass_ paradigm: the model encodes the
waveform once and generates a static explanation or answer. This design is computationally predictable, but it
frequently fails on reasoning-oriented queries that require fine-grained evidence. When the decisive cue is weak
(e.g., a short utterance) or temporally localized (e.g., event ordering), single-pass models cannot “go back”
to verify the signal. As a result, they may produce plausible-but-unsupported rationales, creating a persistent
_perception gap_ between what the audio contains and what the system claims.
A naive fix is to always offload to the cloud or to always execute an expensive tool pipeline (e.g., ASR
+ multi-pass re-listening). However, always-on strategies are misaligned with edge constraints: they increase
average latency and bandwidth usage, and expand the exposure surface of sensitive acoustic content. Moreover,
tool execution can inject noise into easy samples (e.g., spurious ASR text in near-silence), which may even _hurt_
accuracy when the baseline is already correct. Prior work in pervasive/edge sensing also suggests that pushing

computation and interaction _toward the point of collection_ can be beneficial for practical deployment, while still
requiring careful system design to avoid unnecessary overheads [3].
We propose **CoFi-Agent** (Tool-Augmented Coarse-to-Fine Agent), a hybrid architecture designed to close
the perception gap _without_ paying the always-on cost. CoFi-Agent performs a fast local perception pass for
every query and _conditionally_ escalates only uncertain cases for targeted refinement. During refinement, a cloud
controller emits lightweight investigation plans, and the edge node executes on-device tools such as temporal
re-listening and local ASR to extract high-value evidence. Crucially, raw audio remains on-premise; only
compact evidence (e.g., transcripts and tool summaries) is transmitted for cloud reasoning, thereby prioritizing
_acoustic privacy_ .
**Contributions.** This paper makes three contributions:


   - **System architecture:** a local-first coarse-to-fine edge–cloud workflow for audio reasoning, targeting
high-performance edge gateways.


   - **Tool-enabled refinement:** targeted re-listening and on-device ASR to recover query-relevant evidence
while keeping raw audio local.


   - **Benchmark evidence:** on MMAR (N=1,000), CoFi-Agent improves accuracy from 27.20% to 53.60%
and achieves a stronger accuracy–efficiency trade-off than an always-on investigation baseline.


We quantify this efficiency advantage via an accuracy–latency trade-off analysis (Fig. **1** ) and present the
overall system workflow in Fig. **2** .

### **2. Related Work**


**2.1.** **Audio-Language Models(Audio-LLMs)**


The integration of audio encoders with Large Language Models has enabled open-ended acoustic understanding.
Models like Qwen-Audio [4], LTU [5], and SALMONN [6], and recent multimodal memory architectures [7]
map audio features into the LLM’s embedding space, allowing for instruction following. However, these models
predominantly operate in a _single-pass_ manner. While efficient for simple captioning, they lack the iterative
reasoning capabilities required for complex forensic tasks [8], where evidence is often subtle or temporally
scattered.


**2.2.** **Agentiv AI and Tool Use**


Recent works have empowered LLMs with external tools (ASR, Python, Search) [9, 10]. Systems like HuggingGPT [11] and AudioGPT [12] orchestrate specialized models to solve complex queries. Yet, most agentic
frameworks assume a cloud-native environment with unlimited bandwidth and compute. They often invoke
tools indiscriminately, which, in an edge context, leads to prohibitive latency and privacy violations. CoFiAgent differentiates itself by being _conditional_ and _local-first_, triggering tool usage only when the lightweight
perception model expresses uncertainty.


**2.3.** **Efficient Edge Intelligence**


Traditional efforts to deploy deep learning on the edge have focused largely on _static model compression_ . Techniques such as quantization (e.g., LLM.int8() [13], AWQ [14]), pruning [15, 16], and knowledge distillation [17]
are effective at reducing the memory footprint of individual models. However, these methods suffer from a

latency than always-on investigation.


fundamental inefficiency: they apply the same computational budget to every input, regardless of difficulty. This
results in _semantic redundancy_, where simple queries (e.g., clear speech) are processed with the same heavy
parameters as complex forensic tasks. Our work addresses this by shifting focus to _dynamic inference_ . Aligning
with _Early-Exit_ architectures (e.g., BranchyNet [18]) and classic _Cascade Systems_ [19], CoFi-Agent implements
a “semantic cascade”: a lightweight perceptual check that exits early for the majority of easy samples, triggering
expensive reasoning tools only for the “hard” tail of the distribution.

### **3. Methodology**


We consider audio reasoning as predicting _𝑦_ ∈Y given audio _𝐴_ and query _𝑄_ while minimizing end-to-end cost
_𝐶_ (latency). CoFi-Agent decomposes inference into coarse perception and conditional refinement.

where _𝑝_ 0 is the initial answer and _𝑠_ 0 is a short rationale/summary.


**3.2.** **Adaptive Confidence Gate**


A cloud controller evaluates ambiguity and self-consistency:


_𝑢_ = G( _𝑠_ 0 _, 𝑄, 𝑝_ 0) _,_ _𝑢_ ∈{0 _,_ 1} _._ (2)


If _𝑢_ = 0, return _𝑦_ = _𝑝_ 0 (Fast Path). If _𝑢_ = 1, trigger refinement (Investigate Path).
**Implementation of** G **.** We implement G as a lightweight prompt-based classifier. It checks for uncertainty cues
(hedging), missing evidence, and logical inconsistencies. In our experiments, G escalates approximately 62%
of MMAR samples to the investigation path. Qualitative analysis shows that _false escalations_ typically occur
on low-SNR non-speech clips where the baseline is correct but “hedges” its language, while _missed escalations_
occur when the baseline hallucinates confidently on speech-heavy questions.


**3.3.** **Stage 1: Cloud-Guided Refinement Planning**


To enable temporal refinement without uploading waveforms, CoFi-Agent uses an on-device segment proposer
P. We implement P with a hybrid strategy: (i) energy-based segmentation for distinct events, and (ii) uniform
sliding windows ( _𝐾_ = 4, 3s duration) for short clips ( _<_ 12 _𝑠_ ). For clips longer than 12s, windows are placed
at relative percentiles (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%) to ensure global coverage. The cloud receives only **region-of-**
**interest (ROI)** metadata (segment timestamps) and selects an ROI index _𝑖_ [∗] and a focused sub-query _𝑞_ focus.

**3.4.** **Stage 2: On-Device Tool Execution**


**3.4.1.** **Tool: Temporal Re-listening**


The edge device runs targeted inference on the selected segment:


_𝑒_ audio = Medge( _𝐴_ [ _𝑡_ s [(] _[𝑖]_ [∗] [)] : _𝑡_ e [(] _[𝑖]_ [∗] [)] ] _, 𝑞_ focus) _._ (3)


**3.4.2.** **Tool: On-Device ASR (Whisper)**


For speech-heavy queries, the device runs local ASR:


_𝑇_ text = ASRlocal( _𝐴_ or _𝐴_ [ _𝑡_ s [(] _[𝑖]_ [∗] [)] : _𝑡_ e [(] _[𝑖]_ [∗] [)] ]) _._ (4)


**3.5.** **Evidence Integration and Verdict**


A cloud reasoner combines ( _𝑠_ 0 _, 𝑒_ audio _,𝑇_ text _, 𝑄_ ) to output:


_𝑦_ final = Mcloud( _𝑠_ 0 _, 𝑒_ audio _,𝑇_ text _, 𝑄_ ) _._ (5)


**3.6.** **Privacy and Bandwidth Efficiency**


Unlike cloud-native approaches that continuously stream raw waveforms, CoFi-Agent adheres to the principle
of _Data Minimization_ .


   - **Acoustic Isolation:** Biometric markers (e.g., voiceprints) and irrelevant background environmental
sounds never leave the local device.


   - **Symbolic Transmission:** The cloud receives only compact, symbolic representations ( _𝑇_ text). We acknowledge that transcripts may still contain sensitive semantic information; however, this text-only format allows
for efficient on-device PII redaction before upload, which is computationally infeasible for raw audio.

### **4. Experimental Evaluation**


**4.1.** **Benchmark and Metrics**


We evaluate on the **MMAR** benchmark [20] ( **N=1,000** ). Each sample contains an audio clip, a natural-language
question, and multiple-choice candidates. We report (i) **Accuracy** and (ii) **Cost** as the average end-to-end
wall-clock latency (seconds/sample, Batch Size=1), including local inference, optional tool execution, network
overhead, and cloud reasoning.


**4.2.** **System Setup and Implementation Details**


**Edge Environment Emulation.** We emulate a high-performance edge gateway using an **NVIDIA Quadro**
**RTX 6000** (24GB VRAM). Each CoFi-Agent instance is allocated a single GPU to reflect an “edge-node
budget.” All models are kept warm in memory to avoid loading overhead. The local perception backbone is
**Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct** [4] in FP16.
**On-Device Tools.** We use **Whisper-small** [21] as the local ASR tool, executed on the same edge GPU. Temporal
re-listening re-invokes the local Audio-LLM on a selected ROI.

Method Acc. Cost


Qwen2-Audio (Baseline) 27.20% 0.155s
Hybrid (Describe→Reason) 39.30% 2.866s
CoFi-Agent (Adaptive Re-listen) 43.10% 6.446s
CoFi-Agent (Always-On + ASR) 51.70% 11.058s
**CoFi-Agent (Adaptive + ASR)** **53.60%** **9.617s**


**Cloud Controller.** The cloud-side controller (gating, planning, and final verdict) uses **OpenAI GPT-4o** [22]
with Temperature=0 for reproducibility. Network RTT from the edge node to the US-East region is approx.
15ms (p50) and 45ms (p95).


**4.3.** **Main Results**


Table **1** summarizes the overall accuracy and end-to-end latency on MMAR (N=1,000). CoFi-Agent (Adaptive +
ASR) achieves the best accuracy (53.60%) while also improving the accuracy–latency operating point compared
to the always-on investigation variant. This trend is consistent with the trade-off curve shown in Fig. **1** .


**4.4.** **Why Adaptive Beats Always-On**


Always-on investigation increases coverage but can inject tool noise into easy samples (e.g., ASR hallucinations
in silence), and it pays the tool cost even when the baseline is already correct. Adaptive gating escalates only
uncertain cases (about 62% on MMAR), yielding a better balance of accuracy and average latency. Table **2**
reports the latency breakdown for CoFi-Agent (Adaptive + ASR).


**Table 2** : Latency Breakdown (CoFi-Agent Adaptive + ASR).


**Component** **Latency (s)**


Stage 0 (Edge Perception) 0.16
Network (RTT + Upload) 0.20
Cloud Gate (Classification) 0.60
On-Device Tools (Whisper/Re-listen) 1.85
Cloud Reasoning (Generation) 6.81
**Total** **9.62**


**4.5.** **Tool-Usage Distribution Under Adaptive Gating**


To better understand where the compute is spent, we measure the distribution of inference paths under adaptive
gating. As shown in Fig. **3**, **38.2%** of samples finish in the Fast Path with **no tools**, while **61.8%** are escalated.
Among escalated samples, temporal re-listening alone accounts for **27.4%**, ASR alone for **19.7%**, and invoking
_both_ tools for **14.7%** . This suggests that (i) a substantial portion of queries are easy enough for single-pass local
perception, and (ii) when escalation is needed, many cases can be resolved with a single lightweight tool rather
than a full always-on pipeline.

**4.6.** **Impact of ASR Tools**


Adding on-device ASR yields a +10.50% absolute gain (43.10% → 53.60%) compared to adaptive re-listening
alone (Table **1** ), confirming that resolving speech semantics is decisive for a large fraction of MMAR questions.
At the same time, Fig. **3** shows ASR is not universally required: adaptive routing avoids paying ASR cost on
samples that do not benefit from it.

### **5. Case Studies**


We analyze three specific samples from the MMAR dataset to demonstrate how CoFi-Agent corrects perception
errors using tool-augmented refinement.


**5.1.** **Sample A (Conversational Implication)**


For the query, “Do the first man’s two statements to the other person have the same implied meaning?”, the
single-pass baseline incorrectly predicts “Same.” The model likely aggregates the general friendly tone of the
voice, failing to distinguish the semantic shift between the two farewells. CoFi-Agent triggers the ASR tool,
which reveals the exact phrasing: the first utterance is a standard “Have a good day,” while the second is the
ominous “Enjoy the next 24 hours of your life.” By accessing this textual evidence, the cloud reasoner detects
the shift in meaning and correctly predicts “Different.”


**5.2.** **Sample B (Keyword Verification)**


When asked, “Does the Chinese the speaker wants to show to their father include the word ‘Ni Hao’?”, the
baseline model incorrectly asserts that the word is present. This error likely stems from the high prior probability
of common greetings appearing in the context of a foreigner speaking Chinese. The investigation path executes
a negative verification using the ASR transcript: _“...Dad, I’m in China, man... Erho? Erho. Okay, good...”_ .
The cloud reasoner confirms the specific target word is absent from the text and corrects the verdict to “Does
not include.”

**5.3.** **Sample C (Semantic Trick/Wifi Password)**


A query asking “What is the wifi password?” exposes a failure in parsing semantic riddles. The baseline
model interprets the barista’s response—“You have to buy Smoothie first”—as a refusal or a precondition.
However, the refinement step captures the full dialogue via ASR: _“Can I get the Wi-Fi password please?_
_You have to buy Smoothie first... Now can I get the password? You have to buy Smoothie first. I just did._
_That’s the best word.”_ The cloud reasoner parses the humor in the transcript and correctly extracts the phrase
“Youhavetobuysmooziefirst” as the password string.


**5.4.** **Failure Mode Analysis**


We observe three common failure cases that explain most remaining errors. **(1) ASR under extreme noise.**
Under very low SNR conditions ( _<_ 0 dB), Whisper may produce corrupted transcripts, which misleads the
cloud reasoner. **(2) Missed short events in long recordings.** The heuristic segment proposer may skip brief
but decisive events in long clips ( _>_ 1 min), causing re-listening to focus on irrelevant regions. **(3) Knowledge-**
**mismatch queries.** A subset of queries require external knowledge not present in the audio; even perfect
perception cannot resolve these cases.

### **6. Conclusion**


CoFi-Agent addresses the tension between perception depth and efficiency in edge audio systems by introducing
a coarse-to-fine architecture that keeps raw waveforms on-premise and invokes cloud reasoning only for highentropy queries (approx. 62% of cases). On the MMAR benchmark, this approach nearly doubles the accuracy
of a local 7B model (27.20% → 53.60%) while maintaining a viable latency profile. Future work will focus
on minimizing decision overhead via learnable gating, jointly training the segment proposer with the reasoning
module, and extending this paradigm to bandwidth-constrained Edge Video scenarios. Ultimately, CoFi-Agent
demonstrates that the future of Edge AI relies on adaptive system design—knowing when to think fast locally,
and when to think slow via the cloud.
