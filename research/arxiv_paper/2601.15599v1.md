I. INTRODUCTION


_A._ _Background_

In today’s markets, businesses must continuously identify
opportunities, adjust strategies, and optimize tactics at short
notice in order to grow or simply remain competitive.
Meanwhile business capabilities increasingly rely on the
integration of diverse functions—sales, marketing, finance,
logistics, and data—working together toward shared outcomes.
Traditional enterprise software, however, is organized around
siloed departments and optimizes tasks rather than end-to-end



value creation. Even though Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) software suites unify data across modular components

[1], which helps with cross-module analysis and reporting, it
often requires rigid workflows that impede rapid changes. As a
result, business organizations struggle to reconfigure
capabilities at the pace required by today’s markets.


This challenge sits at the core of enterprise digital
transformation, which is more than technology adoption: it is a
multi-dimensional shift spanning strategy, people,
organizational structure, customers, ecosystem partnerships,
technology, and innovation. Recent case-based research shows
that successful digital transformations depends on coordinated,
cross-functional orchestration rather than isolated tools [2].


Decades of business process redesign (BPR) and business
process management (BPM) research anticipated this need.
Classic BPR argues that companies should “reengineer” work—
rethinking processes across functional boundaries instead of
automating legacy tasks—because dramatic performance gains
come from process-centric, not department-centric, design.
Complementary work on process innovation positions
technology as the key enabler of such redesign. Together, these
perspectives emphasize end-to-end process orientation, explicit
ownership of outcomes, and measurement against
customer-facing results [3], [4]. More recent research links BPM
and BPR directly to digital transformation as its integral part [5],

[6]. It requires new BPM logics—lighter-weight processes,
infrastructural flexibility, and “mindful actors” who can act on
less than ideal situations—that better accommodate continual
change and data-driven decision-making [7].


Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based AI
agents offer new opportunities to re-imagine how business
operates. Multi-agent systems (MAS), once largely confined to
scientific and engineering domains, are becoming viable in
business contexts thanks to the increasingly software-centric and
data-driven nature of business operations. A recent study by
Dennis et al. [8] suggested that AI agents are likely to be
accepted as full team members, requiring many classic
collaboration questions to be re-examined in the context of
human-AI teams. Saghafian and Idan [9] argued that the future
application of AI in many domains should focus on combining
artificial and human intelligence.


While LLMs excel in natural language understanding,
learning and semantic reasoning over unstructured data, they


often struggle with deterministic execution, especially when it
involves complex and lengthy logic reasoning [10]. This makes
them less effective in business process automation where
decisions need to be reasonable and verifiable. This gap can be
filled by a traditional branch of AI—predicate calculus-based
logic programming [11]. The formal reasoning nature of logic
programming provides a simple and compact mechanism to
encode business logic, and it is intuitive to reason over. The
combining of the strengths of neural network-based LLM and
the reasoning power of logic programming, which is a type of
symbolic AI, is known as a neuro-symbolic approach.


_B._ _Proposed System_

We introduce Autonomous Business System
(AUTOBUS **)** —a system that intelligently orchestrates end-toend business initiatives by integrating human intelligence,
neuro-symbolic AI, and business semantics grounded in
business semantic-centric enterprise data. A business initiative
represents a concrete objective with defined goals, evaluation
metrics, constraints, and expected artifacts. In contrast to
software systems organized around fixed and siloed
departments, AUTOBUS treats the cross-functional human-AI
teams as the primary building block of the enterprise, aiming to
deliver end-to-end enterprise level results. _Figure 1_ shows an
overview of AUTOBUS.


AUTOBUS is best suited for modern data-rich organizations
that rely on cross-functional workflows. In such an environment,
business initiatives are typically data and software driven, and
core systems expose APIs and events so that data can flow
across tasks with limited manual intervention.

integrates human intelligence, neuro-symbolic AI, and business semantics to
orchestrate end-to-end business initiatives. Teams in which humans and AI are
peer members collaborating under shared objectives, metrics, constraints, and
expected artifacts—delivering enterprise-level outcomes beyond siloed
departments.


_C._ _Related Work_

Research on autonomous business and agent-based business
process management can be dated back to more than two
decades. Jennings et al. [12] described an agent-based business
process management system where agents are humans. Flor [13]
explored programmable autonomous business built entirely in



software and did not require humans to operate other than the
community of customers of the business. More recently, Hughes
et al. [14] investigated how AI agents and agentic systems could
reshape industries by decentralizing decision-making,
reconfiguring organizational structures, and strengthening
cross-functional collaboration. Lashkevich et al. [15] studied
using LLMs to assist the redesign of business process to reduce
waiting time. Regarding having AI agents as team members,
Dennis, Lakhiwal and Sachdeva [8] studied the potentially
positive and negative disruptive influence on teamwork. Lemon

[16] surveyed the challenges and some of the open research
directions in multi-party systems where AI agents interact with
more than one human.


Even though LLM-based agentic systems are a very recent
development, they have already made tremendous progress.
Acharya, Kuppan and Divya [17] surveyed the current and
potential applications in various real-world domains such as
healthcare finance, supply chain, education, and adaptive
software systems. Khamis [18] examined the different
architectural components of an agentic system. Hu, Lu and
Clune [19] even proposed a new research area of automated
design of agentic systems.


While neuro-symbolic AI has been gaining ground in AI
research according to these review papers: [20], [21], [22],
research on integrating LLM and logic programming for
business systems has only recently emerged. Mezini et al. [23]
integrated temporal-logic rules with learned neural network
models to predict business process outcomes. Manuj et al. [24]
and used LLMs to extract facts from legal contracts and then
used logic programs for coverage and eligibility reasoning for
policy compliance and claims. Neuro-symbolic AI has also been
applied in E-commerce recommendation systems [25], [26],

[27]. Though not specifically for business systems, Vakharia et
al. [28] used logic programming to improve the performance of
LLMs in domain specific question answering tasks. Pan et al.

[31] used LLMs to translate logical reasoning problems in
natural language into a symbolic representations and then used
a symbolic logic solver to solve the problems deterministically.
Borazjanizadeh and Piantadosi [29] showed that integrating
logic programming into the inference pipeline of LLMs yielded
robust performance gains. Yang, Chen and Tam [30] used logic
programs generated by LLMs to solve arithmetic problems.


_D._ _Our Contribution_

Existing neuro-symbolic approaches in literature that utilize
LLMs and logic programming tend to focus on narrow
reasoning tasks or domains. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work was designed for real-world, data-rich business
environments, providing actionable guidance for the design and
operation of end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS:

  - improves time to market: a coherent data, humans, and

neuro-symbolic AI architecture enables business
initiatives to iterate rapidly, and

  - provides practical guidance **:** designed for real-world

businesses, we provide reference implementation of a
case study with open source code in GitHub.


II. AUTOBUS


_A._ _Business Initiative_

A business initiative is modeled as a sequence of tasks, often
with parallel branches, that transform inputs into measurable
outcomes. Each task has explicit pre-/post-conditions, required
data, and well-defined actions. Typically these actions are
executed by operational software such as API calls. Most
importantly, decisions were made throughout the execution of
the tasks. Each individual task as well as the business initiative
as a whole are evaluated by defined rules and metrics. Parts or
the whole of the initiative can be iterative. Any business
initiatives that can be modeled in this form, as illustrated in
_Figure 2_, are candidates for AUTOBUS.


Fig. 2. Business initiative model: inputs traverse a sequence of data-driven
tasks—often with parallel branches—to yield measurable outcomes. Each task
defines pre/post-conditions, required data, and software-executed API actions,
with decisions throughout. The initiative is evaluated by goals and metrics, and
sub-flows may iterate.


_B._ _Principal Components_

At the core of AUTOBUS are humans, enterprise data,
LLM-based AI agents, and a logic programming engine. Each
business initiative has its own task- and domain-specific
instructions, while auxiliary tools—including other AI agents,
machine learning models, and internal or external APIs—
provide additional computational and informational support, as
well as sending actions to operational systems. _Figure 3_ presents
the principal components of AUTOBUS.


Operationally, the core AI agents construct logic programs
by synthesizing information from business semantics, task
instructions and tools availability. These logic programs are then
executed by the logic engine. Groundings for facts are typically
from enterprise data. In addition, the logic programs invoke
tools to get groundings for predicates that cannot be obtained
upfront from enterprise data. Some examples are real-time data
from the web, data science models, and system events. The logic
programs could also invoke other AI agents that in turn utilize
other tools or resources to fulfill the request. Tools are also used
to perform actions of the logic programs, such as calling APIs
or persisting outcome of the logic program. _Figure 4_ depicts the
following steps:

  - translate task instructions into logic predicates,



Fig.3. Principal components of AUTOBUS. Neuro-symbolic AI, humans, and
enterprise data provide complementary intelligence and context to the
AUTOBUS orchestration core, which coordinates decisions and actions. A
tooling layer of APIs, AI agents, machine-learning models, and other
integrations executes these decisions against operational systems.


  - augment these predicates with the relevant facts and

foundational rules derived from business semantics in
enterprise data, and

  - specify groundings from enterprise data and auxiliary

tools such as machine learning models, API calls and
other AI agents.


The logic engine then executes the generated logic program to
drive actions.


Fig. 4. Logic program generation and execution. AI agents translate task
instructions into logic predicates and enrich them with relevant logic facts,
foundational rules, and groundings derived from enterprise data and auxiliary
tools. The resulting logic program is executed by the logic engine, which
determines task feasibility, enforces constraints, and orchestrates actions.


_C._ _Logic Program_

Logic programs models tasks using the fundamental
constructs of predicate logic—the language of facts, rules, and
structured inference. Prolog is used in this work. At a conceptual
level, a task can be described by logic predicates such as:

```
  task(T).
  requires(T, Data).
  precondition(T, P).
  postcondition(T, Q).

```

These predicates capture the essential semantics of the tasks,
their dependencies, and their expected effects. They allow
AUTOBUS to represent an initiative not as ad-hoc procedural
code but as a declarative structure that explicitly states what
must be true before and after each task, as well as what data and
decisions govern its execution. This makes the intent and logic
of the tasks transparent, auditable, and directly aligned with
business semantics.


Building on these preliminaries, logic programming enables
AUTOBUS to orchestrate tasks by reasoning over the evolving
state. For example, a task is executable when the logic inference
engine can derive that all its preconditions hold. Formally, when
predicates such as

```
  holds(P, State).

```

are satisfied, the rule that governs task readiness is satisfied.
Parallel branches arise naturally as multiple tasks
simultaneously satisfy their preconditions, and iterative
structures can be expressed through rules that re-activate a task
when certain conditions recur:

```
  repeat_until(Task, Goal).

```

Decisions within a task are represented by rules with alternative
heads or guarded conditions, allowing the system to select
actions, such as invoking an API to update enterprise data based
on the current logical state:

```
  invoke(Action, Params).

```

Evaluation rules and metrics are encoded as higher-level
predicates that compute whether an initiative or a task meets
defined business criteria, enabling continuous assessment
during execution. For example, a customer success evaluation
of whether an initiative resolves the customer problem combines
operational and customer-satisfaction metrics into a single
evaluation rule:

```
  resolved(I) :- outcome(I, resolved).

  success(I) :  resolved(I),
  customer_satisfaction(I, Score),
  Score >= 4.0.

```

A logic program for a task in AUTOBUS consists of three
main parts:



1. facts and foundational rules,


2. task specific rules, and


3. predicates for actions and task outcomes.


Enterprise data serve as the source of logic facts and
foundational rules, which describe business entities, their
relationships, and constraints. These are common to all
initiatives within an organization and serve as the anchor,
providing a shared foundation for tasks within an initiative, and
across all initiatives. To enable AI agents to reliably derive these
facts, AUTOBUS adopts the business-semantics–centric
enterprise data system specified in a recent work [32]. Guided
by task instructions, the AI agents extract and construct the facts
and foundational rules, grounding them in the enterprise’s
formal semantic structures. This semantic foundation is essential
for ensuring that the generated logic programs are consistent
with domain meaning and for maximizing automated logic
program generation and minimizing the need for humans to
describe the data manually.


These enterprise-data-derived facts can be further
augmented with real-time information, including human inputs,
live machine learning model inferences, API responses, and
outputs produced by other AI agents.


Beyond the facts, there are task-specific rules. These rules
are generated by the AI agents based on the task instructions and
descriptions of various tools available. Since tasks differ in
purpose, scope, and domain, the resulting rules can vary widely.
Common categories include rules that:

  - identify and filter business entities based on task-specific

criteria, and

  - provides reasoning from facts via rules to actions.


For predicates that lead to actions or task outcomes, it involves
triggering some events. For modern data- and software-driven
businesses, it typically means invoking the services of some
operational systems, passing in some prepared dataset. It could
also simply be persisting the outcomes of the task. _Figure 5_
illustrates the anatomy of a logic program in AUTOBUS.


_D._ _Business Semantics Centric Enterprise Data_

A foundational component of AUTOBUS is a business
semantics centric enterprise data system, as specified by Pang

[32]. As the author stated, such a system is an essential and
integral element of a modern data-driven business rather than
merely a data management utility. We extend this view by
positioning this enterprise data system as one of the three pillars
of autonomous business, together with humans and neurosymbolic AI.


Being business semantics centric, the aforementioned
enterprise data system organizes information into typed and
schema-governed structures around business entities such as
consumers and subscriptions, and their relationships. These
structured data assets form the basis of an enterprise knowledge
graph (KG) in which entities, relationships, and constraints are
explicitly represented. For example, consumer–subscription
associations and status transitions are captured as KG triples
aligned with the business organization’s ontology and reference
data models. This provides the business semantic from which


Fig. 5. Anatomy of an AUTOBUS logic program. Each task-level logic
program comprises three elements: (1) facts and foundational rules derived
from enterprise data, (2) task-specific rules generated from the task instructions
and available tools, and (3) predicates that define actions and task outcomes.
Task-specific rules identify relevant entities, apply filters, and connect facts to
actions, while action predicates trigger operational events.


AUTOBUS derives the facts and foundational rules, as well as
their groundings, for the logic programs. KG triples are
translated to logic facts, such as the following snippet, which
states that `c123` is a consumer who subscribes to an active
subscription `s456` :

```
  consumer(c123).
  subscription(s456).
  subscribe(c123, s456).
  has_status(s456, active).

```

Schema-level constraints and domain rules in the KG are
similarly translated to foundational logic rules, including
integrity checks and task preconditions:

```
  active_subscription(S):    has_status(S, active),
    subscribe(_, S).

  precondition(send_promotion(C)):  consumer(C),
  subscribe(C, S),
  active_subscription(S).

```

The first predicate defines an active subscription as one that is
subscribed by any consumer and has an active status. The second
one states that promotion is sent to a consumer only if the
consumer has an active subscription.


Structured enterprise data represent a semantic knowledge
graph. When translated to logic facts and foundational rules, it
provides the grounding for reasoning about the business.



Methodologies for generating knowledge graph from relational
data are well-established [33]. Typically, table rows are
translated to graph nodes, which are then linked to their column
values to form bipartite “star” sub-graphs. These sub-graphs are
subsequently connected via shared values to form the entire
graph.


Moreover, logic inference tools that work directly on large
knowledge graphs stored in a database, rather than text based
rules, have started to emerge [34], [35]. This is essential for
scaling to the potentially very large data volume in today’s
businesses.


_E._ _Humans_

Humans play a key role in AUTOBUS, providing the
domain expertise, contextual judgment, and strategic oversight
that anchor the system’s neuro-symbolic reasoning. Humans
supply the nuanced judgements and interpretations—such as
ethical considerations, policy intent, organizational priorities,
and exception handling—that neither logic programs nor AI
agents can reliably infer in isolation. Before setting up tasks for
a business initiative, humans:

  - define and maintain the business semantics and structure

enterprise data accordingly, and

  - curate the ontologies and common policies that govern

the logic of tasks.


When setting up the business initiatives, humans:

  - compose task instructions,

  - set the objectives and evaluation criteria, and

  - curate tools to be used for the tasks.


During execution of tasks, humans:

  - validate ambiguous or high-impact decisions in the

generated logic programs, and

  - iteratively refine the task instructions in response to task

and initiative level outcomes.


Human involvement is critical not only for ensuring
correctness, accountability, and alignment with organizational
goals, but also for enabling AUTOBUS to adapt to real-world
complexity and maintain trustworthiness over time.


III. VALIDATION CASE STUDY


_A._ _Introduction_
We validate the effectiveness of AUTOBUS through a case
study of implementing a business initiative for an online content
subscription business as a proof of concept. The company has
well over a million subscribers and is in the early stage of AI
transformation. We first describe the business initiative, break it
down into three tasks, and describe the generated logic
programs. We then compare and contrast with the traditional
approach and provide metrics that shows that AUTOBUS
accelerates the time to market. We also discuss the factors
contributing to this improvement.


As presented in _Figure 6_, the key business entities involved
in the case study are consumer, subscription, and product. A
consumer is either a subscriber, who subscribes to one or more
products, or a non-subscriber. In other words, a consumer
subscribes to zero or more products. There are profile attributes
attached to consumers, including information about consumers
collected from the subscriptions as well as any data from thirdparty data providers.


Fig. 6. Entity–relationship diagram for the case study. The primary business
entities are consumer **,** subscription **,** and product. A consumer may hold zero or
more subscriptions. Consumer records include profile attributes obtained from
subscription data and augmented with third-party data sources. The
relationships among these entities and their associated attributes are formally
depicted in the diagram.


_B._ _Business Initiative and Tasks_

For a subscription-based business, the top priority is to
acquire new subscribers and at the same time retain existing
ones. This case study is about subscriber retention. A common
tactic is to proactively reach out to high-churn-risk subscribers
and offer them perks. The perks can be for certain markets
and/or specific products. Concretely, the case study is to send
promotions to active subscribers who:


1. subscribe to a certain product, pay a monthly rate above

certain dollars, have a certain churn risk level, and


2. have household incomes above the median of the cities

residing in.


The initiative is broken down into three tasks, as depicted in
_Figure 7_ :


1. Identify and retrieve the target subscribers based on

Criterion 1 only. That is, without the household income
constraint, which will be handled in Task 3.


2. Obtain the median household income for the cities where

the subscribers reside. This involves calling a specialized
AI agent that fetches median city household income data
from the web.


3. Based on the outcomes of Tasks 1 and 2, further filter the

subscriptions to include only those whose households
have income above the cities’ median. Then send
promotions to the target subscribers. The latter involves
the action of making API calls to the marketing platform.


_C._ _Logic Programs_

The logic programs of all three tasks are generated by the
same core AI agent of AUTOBUS, with task specific



Fig. 7. The initiative targets subscribers who (i) subscribe to Product 1, (ii)
have churn-risk level 4, and (iii) have household income above median of the
city. It is organized into three tasks: retrieving eligible subscribers from
enterprise data, fetching median incomes of cities from the web, and sending
promotions to the resulting target subscribers through marketing APIs.


instructions. Each logic program comprises three sections: (1)
facts, (2) task specific rules, and (3) actions. These elements are
common to data-driven business tasks. The structure of the logic
program generated for Task 3 is presented in _Figure 8_ . It is quite
sophisticated, containing the following elements:


1. Facts and foundational rules: loaded from enterprise

data, and the outcomes of Task 1 and 2.


2. Task rules: the logic of targeting subscribers who (i) are

savable churns determined by Task 1, and (ii) have
household incomes above the medians of the cities of
residence, which are the outcome of Task 2.


3. Actions: (i) persist the target subscriptions into the

database, and (ii) send the target subscriptions to a
marketing campaign via a tool call.


_D._ _Result and Discussion_

The case study was conducted by the first author at the
workplace as a proof of concept to mimic a typical business
initiative that involves audience segmentation and engagement.
While the ultimate goal is to improve retention, a useful metric
for the initiative is time-to-market. Whether the team can
quickly iterate the initiative with controlled variation of
parameters so as to validate hypothesis often determines
whether the ultimate goal of minimizing churn can be achieved.
This metric is closely aligned with the main value proposition of
AUTOBUS: accelerating time to market.


To evaluate time-to-market, we compare the time required
to complete the three tasks shown in Figure 7 with a baseline
reflecting the organization’s existing approach. In the baseline,
each task requires building task-specific data pipelines and
deploying them into the enterprise data infrastructure. The
estimate is derived from observations of similar efforts
conducted in the past, which typically involve multiple siloed
departments. Coordination across these groups often requires
several rounds of discussions before roles, responsibilities, and
technical details are fully aligned. This overhead is repeated for
subsequent initiatives—even when they are similar—because
team composition often changes and time is again spent reestablishing shared understanding, down to minor details.


With AUTOBUS, task logic programs are generated by a
consistent set of core AI agents using task instructions, shared
enterprise data, and standardized tools. This approach largely


eliminates the unproductive coordination cycles inherent in the
baseline workflow. The reduction in redundant planning and


Fig. 8. Structure of the logic program for Task 3, generated by the AUTOBUS
core AI agent from task-specific instruction. The program consists of three
sections—facts, task-specific rules, and actions—where facts and foundational
rules are derived from enterprise data and the outputs of Tasks 1 and 2; task
rules encode the targeting logic; and actions persist the results and invoke a
marketing campaign via tool call.



alignment effort, together with the consistent execution of the
logics, constitute the primary contributor to improved time to
market.


The results are recorded in _Table 1_ . Since Tasks 1 and 2 can
be executed in parallel, the time to market is two days for
AUTOBUS versus 2 weeks with the existing approach. There is
flexibility in structuring the initiative. Breaking it down into
three tasks in this case study is a design choice that follows a
good system design practice of grouping logically related
activities in separate modules for ease of reasoning, maintenance
and reuse. Functionally, it would work just as well if the three
tasks are combined into one.

IV. CONCLUSION, LIMITATION & FUTURE WORK
Autonomous Business System (AUTOBUS) provides a
logical, clear, and well-organized architecture for businesses to
focus their resources on end-to-end business initiatives that
bring measurable values, rather than siloed departmental
operations. It is also a practical system for humans to team up
with neuro-symbolic AI in a data-rich business environment,
with a reference implementation for a case study.


Enterprise data volume can be very large in today’s data
driven business. It could be a challenge to effectively transform
business entities their attributes and relationships into predicate
logic facts usable in logic programs. This work does not
specifically address this issue. There are tools to cope with this
challenge, such as PyReason [34], which can operate directly on
a graph database, and Logica [36], which compiles to SQL for
execution in big data databases.


There is a critical factor for the success of AUTOBUS:
effective human-AI teaming. It demands very different skills
than traditional roles. While AUTOBUS provides a practical
system, it does not address the organizational issue of
transforming existing workforces to team with AI. This is a
research topic on its own.


We also suggest the following two avenues for future work:


1. Conduct broader case studies of applying AUTOBUS,

and refine the architecture based on the findings.


2. Autonomous business system planning and optimization

driven by business priorities. For example, representing
the logic programs of business initiatives as graphs, the
research can be guided by complex systems and adaptive
network theories [37].
