**Abstract**


We study the valuation of Asian options in a binomial market with
permanent price impact, extending the Cox–Ross–Rubinstein framework under a modified risk–neutral probability. We obtain an exact pathwise representation for geometric Asian options and derive
two–sided bounds for arithmetic Asian options. Our analysis identifies the no–arbitrage region in terms of hedging volumes and shows
that permanent price impact systematically raises Asian option prices.
Numerical examples illustrate the effect of the impact parameter and
hedging volumes on the resulting prices.

### **1 Introduction**


Each time a trader places a buy (sell) order, the transaction pushes
the asset price upward (downward). The magnitude of this movement,
known as price impact, is of substantial interest because once trading
is understood to influence prices, it constitutes an inherent cost to the

trader. In this work, we examine how such price impact alters option
valuation. Our focus is on Asian options, whose payoffs depend on
the entire price trajectory. This path dependence makes them particularly sensitive to market impact. The effect of each trade propagates
through time and influences the average price, thereby affecting its
fair value. We seek to obtain tractable numerical procedures for computing Asian option price under price impact. We study the problem
under a binomial option pricing formulation.
The binomial option pricing model is a discrete time approach
to pricing options proposed by Cox et al. 1979. This approach is
also referred to as the CRR model after the initials of the authors of
the paper. It was shown that in the limiting case the CRR model
converges to the closed form solution for the price of the European
call option as arrived by Black-Scholes-Merton (Black and Scholes
1973; Merton 1973). The CRR model serves as a numerical approach
for pricing of contingent claims where analytical solution of the price
is not always possible to achieve. Unlike the Black-Scholes-Merton
formulation for the European call option, in the CRR model it is
assumed trading takes place at discrete time periods. Asian option
is an option contract whose payoff depends on the average value of
the price of the underlying till the expiry. Unlike the vanilla call or
put option whose payoff is dependent only on the terminal value of
the asset price, the price of the Asian option depends on the entire
price path. The Asian option is therefore a path-dependent option.
Formally, the Asian call option has the following payoffs, where _V_ 0
denotes the price of the option at period 0 and _K_ denotes the strike
price,

The binomial option pricing model has been studied previously in
the context of pricing Asian options (Chalasani, Jha, Egriboyun, and


2


Varikooty 1999; Chalasani, Jha, and Varikooty 1998; Dai 2003; Hsu
and Lyuu 2011; K. I. Kim and Qian 2007). In particular the exact
analytical pricing of Arithmetic Asian options has been realised to be
a difficult problem even under the simplifying Black-Scholes assumptions (Milevsky and Posner 1998). Several bounds for Arithmetic
Asian options have been reported (Albrecher et al. 2008; Choe and
M. Kim 2021; Chung and Wong 2014a; Fusai et al. 2008; Nielsen and
Sandmann 2003). Other analytical and numerical approaches to pricing Arithmetic Asian options include, Choi 2018; Chung and Wong
2014b; Ding et al. 2023; Kemna and Vorst 1990; Kirkby 2016; Linetsky 2004; Mudzimbabwe et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2013; Vecer 2001.
Price impact, as defined by Bouchaud 2009, is the correlation between an incoming order and the subsequent price change. This implies that an increase in buy orders pushes prices upward, while an
increase in sell orders pushes prices downward. The empirical presence of price impact is well documented (Hasbrouck and Seppi 2001;
Madhavan et al. 1997; Said et al. 2021; Webster 2023), motivating
the need to incorporate its effects into option pricing models. Gu´eant
and Pu 2017 formulates the pricing problem under market impact as
a stochastic control problem. Loeper 2018 also studies the problem of
pricing under a linear market impact. To the best of our knowledge
there is no article studying Asian option valuation under price impact.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the
Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model and its extension under price impact. We derive the risk-neutral probability under market impact and
the no-arbitrage conditions. In Section 3 we use this model to price
geometric Asian options and obtain an exact representation for its
price. In Section 4 we obtain two sided bounds for the arithmetic
Asian options. In Section 5 we check the numerical accuracy of the
model against a benchmark approach without impac. We next use the
model to illustrate the effect of price impact on the prices. In Section
6 we conclude the article and mention some potential extensions that
can be considered.

### **2 CRR model with price impact**


In the standard CRR (binomial) pricing model, time is divided into
_n ∈_ N discrete periods. For some _m ∈_ N with _m_ +1 _< n_, let the stock


3


price at period _m_ be _Sm_ . The price evolves according to,



_Sm_ +1 =




 _uSm,_ with probability _q,_


 _dSm,_ with probability 1 _−_ _q._



where _q_ denotes the probability of an upward movement by factor
_u_, and 1 _−_ _q_ the probability of a downward movement by factor _d_ .
Since the stock can take two possible values at each step, the model
is referred to as the binomial option pricing model.
Incorporating price impact into this framework requires modifying
the transition dynamics. We consider a linear and permanent impact
specification following Bouchaud 2009, which itself is motivated by the
seminal model of Kyle 1985. In the Kyle model, trades from informed
and noise traders are cleared by a market maker, and the execution of
volume _v_ shares produces a predictable shift in the asset price. When
hedging an option, the market maker must trade _v_ shares, generating
an impact of the form,


∆ _S_ = _λv_


where _λ >_ 0 is the price-impact coefficient, _vb_ and _vs_ denote buy
and sell volumes, respectively, and _v_ = _vb−vs_ is the net traded volume.
The Kyle specification assumes that impact is linear in trade size
and permanent in its effect on the price. Although empirical studies suggest that market impact is typically concave in volume and
partially transient (see Bouchaud 2009), the linear and permanent
formulation offers analytical tractability and lends itself to incorporation within the CRR framework. For these reasons, we adopt this
specification in what follows.
We can rewrite the Kyle impact model as follows,


∆ _pn_
= _[λv][n]_
_pn−_ 1 _pn−_ 1


For small relative changes,


_pn_
= 1 + _[λv][n]_
_pn−_ 1 _pn−_ 1


For small impacts where _[λϵ][n][v][n]_

_pn−_ 1 _[≪]_ [1,]




 log 1 + _[λϵ][n][v][n]_

_pn−_ 1


4




_≈_ _[λϵ][n][v][n]_

_pn−_ 1


Define a parameter _λ_ [˜] such that,


_λvn_ = _λv_ [˜] _n_
_pn−_ 1


This gives us,
log( _pn_ ) = log( _pn−_ 1) + _λv_ [˜] _n_


and we obtain,
_pn_ = _pn−_ 1 _· eλv_ ˜ _n_

We shall use _λ_ instead of _λ_ [˜] from henceforth. Under price impact,
the binomial model therefore becomes,



_Sm_ +1 =




 _Su_ = _uSme_ _[λv][u]_ _,_ with probability _q,_

 _Sd_ = _dSme_ _[−][λv][d]_ _,_ with probability 1 _−_ _q._



where _v_ _[u]_ and _v_ _[d]_ are the net trading volume in the up and down
movements respectively. The adjusted up (˜ _u_ ) and adjusted down ( _d_ [˜] )
factors are,


_u_ ˜ = _ue_ _[λv][u]_

_d_ ˜ = _de_ _[−][λv][d]_


The binomial transitions can therefore be rewritten as,



_Sm_ +1 =




 _Su_ = ˜ _uSm,_ with probability _q,_


 _Sd_ = _dS_ [˜] _m,_ with probability 1 _−_ _q._



At any node of the binomial tree, the value of the option may be
replicated by constructing a portfolio consisting of ∆shares of the
underlying asset and a position _B_ in the risk-free bond. The central
replication requirement is that this portfolio must match the option
value in both possible successor states. Denoting the option values
in the up and down states by _Vu_ and _Vd_, respectively, and letting _r_
denote the gross risk-free return, the replication conditions are


∆ _Su_ + _Br_ = _Vu,_ ∆ _Sd_ + _Br_ = _Vd._


In the presence of price impact, the underlying transitions are given by
_Su_ = ˜ _uSm_ and _Sd_ = _dS_ [˜] _m_, where ˜ _u_ and _d_ [˜] denote the impact-adjusted
multipliers.


5


Subtracting the two replication equations eliminates _B_ and yields
an expression for the hedge ratio,


_Vu −_ _Vd_

∆= _[V][u][ −]_ _[V][d]_ = _._

_Su −_ _Sd_ _Sm_ (˜ _u −_ _d_ [˜] )



This quantity represents the number of shares that must be held in
order to replicate the instantaneous change in the option value at the
node.
Once ∆is determined, the bond position _B_ follows immediately
from either replication equation. Using the down-state relation, we
obtain




[∆] _[S][d]_ _[d]_ [˜]

= _[V][d][ −]_ [∆] _[S]_ _._
_r_ _r_



_B_ = _[V][d][ −]_ [∆] _[S][d]_



_._
_r_



An analogous expression follows from the up-state value, and both
necessarily agree. The current value of the option is then the cost of
establishing this replicating portfolio,


_V_ = ∆ _Sm_ + _B,_


which constitutes the unique no-arbitrage price at the node.
The replication relations allow us to rewrite the option value in
risk-neutral form. Substituting the expressions for ∆and _B_ into _V_ =
∆ _S_ + _B_ and simplifying yields,



_V_ = [1]

_r −_ _d_ [˜]
_Vu_ + _[u]_ [˜] _[ −]_ _[r]_ _Vd_

This motivates the definition of the adjusted risk-neutral probability

= _r,_


The no-arbitrage condition requires that, under the effective riskneutral probability, the expected gross return on the underlying equals
the risk-free rate. Lemma 2.1 shows the consistency of the pricing
measure.
The adjusted risk-neutral probability can be written explicitly as


_r −_ _de_ _[−][λv][d]_
_p_ [adj] = _[.]_

_ue_ _[λv][u]_ _−_ _de_ _[−][λv][d]_


When the volumes _v_ _[u]_ and _v_ _[d]_ are constant across time and nodes,
the effective risk-neutral probability remains constant throughout the
tree. This property greatly simplifies numerical valuation and plays
an important role in enabling tractable pricing in the presence of permanent linear price impact.
In the classical CRR model without price impact, the risk-neutral
probability,

_p_ = _[r][ −]_ _[d]_

_u −_ _d_

is determined by the requirement that the expected return of the stock
under the risk-neutral measure equals the risk-free rate. Importantly,
this probability does not represent the real-world likelihood of an upward movement, it is a probability chosen to enforce the no-arbitrage
condition that discounted asset prices must evolve as martingales.
When price impact is introduced, the stock no longer moves according to the factors _u_ and _d_ but rather according to the adjusted
multipliers ˜ _u_ and _d_ [˜] . Since hedging trades now affect future prices, the
replication strategy changes, and so does the probability that ensures
the martingale property of the discounted stock price. The adjusted
probability

_p_ [adj] = _[r][ −]_ _[d]_ [˜]

_u_ ˜ _−_ _d_ [˜]

therefore incorporates the additional cost and distortion induced by
permanent price impact. In the limit _λ →_ 0 (no price impact), we
recover the standard CRR expression, illustrating that the classical
model is a special case of the impact-adjusted framework.

#### **2.1 No-arbitrage region and admissible hedg-** **ing volumes**

The impact-adjusted CRR model remains arbitrage-free only if the
adjusted risk-neutral probability _p_ [adj] lies in [0 _,_ 1]. From the replicating
portfolio construction above, we have,

_p_ [adj] = _[r][ −]_ _[d]_ [˜] _,_

_u_ ˜ _−_ _d_ [˜]


For _p_ [adj] to define a valid risk-neutral probability, we require,


0 _≤_ _p_ [adj] _≤_ 1 _._


Since we are in a binomial setting, we assume ˜ _u >_ _d_ [˜], so that the
denominator ˜ _u −_ _d_ [˜] is strictly positive. The lower bound _p_ [adj] _≥_ 0 then
reduces to


_r −_ _d_ [˜]
_≥_ 0 _⇐⇒_ _r −_ _d_ [˜] _≥_ 0 _⇐⇒_ _r ≥_ _d._ [˜]
_u_ ˜ _−_ _d_ [˜]


Similarly, the upper bound _p_ [adj] _≤_ 1 is equivalent to


_r −_ _d_ [˜]
_≤_ 1 _⇐⇒_ _r −_ _d_ [˜] _≤_ _u_ ˜ _−_ _d_ [˜] _⇐⇒_ _r ≤_ _u._ ˜
_u_ ˜ _−_ _d_ [˜]


Combining these two inequalities yields the familiar no-arbitrage restriction from the CRR model, now expressed in terms of the impactadjusted factors:
_d_ ˜ _≤_ _r ≤_ _u._ ˜


In words, the risk-free return must lie between the effective down and
up multipliers. If _r ≤_ _d_ [˜], the stock almost surely dominates the bond,
leading to an arbitrage by going long the stock and short the bond.
If _r ≥_ _u_ ˜, the bond dominates the stock, and an arbitrage arises by
shorting the stock and lending at the risk-free rate. The condition
_d < r <_ ˜ ˜ _u_ is therefore the impact-adjusted analogue of the standard
CRR no-arbitrage condition _d < r < u_ .
Substituting the explicit expressions for ˜ _u_ and _d_ [˜],


_d_ ˜ = _de_ _[−][λv][d]_ _,_ _u_ ˜ = _ue_ _[λv][u]_ _,_


we can rewrite the no-arbitrage inequalities as constraints on the hedging volumes:
_de_ _[−][λv][d]_ _≤_ _r ≤_ _ue_ _[λv][u]_ _._


9


These may be rearranged to give minimal admissible volumes,




[1] - _r_

_λ_ [ln] _d_



_u_



_v_ _[d]_ _≥−_ [1]



_d_




=: _v_ min _[d]_ _[,]_ _v_ _[u]_ _≥_ [1]




[1] - _r_

_λ_ [ln] _u_




=: _v_ min _[u]_ _[.]_



The “no-arbitrage region” in ( _v_ _[u]_ _, v_ _[d]_ )-space is thus described by the
set of pairs satisfying


_v_ _[d]_ _≥_ _v_ min _[d]_ _[,]_ _v_ _[u]_ _≥_ _v_ min _[u]_ _[.]_


Under the standard CRR assumption _d < r < u_, we have ln( _r/d_ ) _>_
0 and ln( _r/u_ ) _<_ 0, so that _v_ min _[d]_ _[<]_ [ 0 and] _[ v]_ min _[u]_ _[<]_ [ 0.] If, in addition, hedging volumes are constrained to be non-negative, _v_ _[u]_ _, v_ _[d]_ _≥_ 0,
these inequalities are automatically satisfied. In this case, every nonnegative choice of hedging volumes is compatible with an arbitragefree, impact-adjusted binomial model, and the condition 0 _≤_ _p_ [adj] _≤_ 1
holds without further restriction.

### **3 Application to Geometric Asian Op-** **tions**


In this section we apply the impact-adjusted binomial framework to
the valuation of geometric Asian call options. We consider an underlying asset following the impacted binomial dynamics described above,
with impact-adjusted up and down factors ˜ _u_ and _d_ [˜] and adjusted riskneutral probability _p_ [adj] .
A geometric Asian call option with maturity at time _n_ has payoff


_Vn_ = max (0 _, Gn −_ _K_ ) _,_


where _K_ denotes the strike price and







1 _/_ ( _n_ +1)



_Gn_ =



_n_

 



_Si_

_i_ =0










is the geometric average of the underlying prices along the path up to
maturity. In contrast to a standard European call option, whose payoff
depends only on the terminal value _Sn_, the geometric Asian payoff
depends on the entire price path ( _S_ 0 _, . . ., Sn_ ) and is therefore pathdependent. In particular, two paths that lead to the same terminal


10


value _Sn_ may nevertheless generate different geometric averages and
hence different payoffs.
For a fixed horizon _n_, a path can be represented by a word in
_{U, D}_ _[n]_, such as _UDU_, indicating the succession of up and down
transitions. For any given path, we write _G_ (path) for the associated
geometric average, _V_ (path) for the corresponding payoff


_V_ (path) = max �0 _, G_ (path) _−_ _K_       - _,_


and _P_ (path) for its risk-neutral probability under the adjusted measure. Since the dynamics are binomial, the probability depends only
on the number of up and down moves:


_P_ (path) =     - _p_ [adj][�][#] _[U]_ [(path)][�] 1 _−_ _p_ [adj][�][#] _[D]_ [(path)] _,_


where # _U_ (path) and # _D_ (path) denote the number of up and down
moves in the path, with # _U_ (path) + # _D_ (path) = _n_ .

We begin with the simplest non-trivial case _n_ = 1, where the option
is defined over two dates _t_ = 0 _,_ 1. There are exactly two paths, _U_ and
_D_ . Starting from _S_ 0, the terminal stock prices are

_S_ 1 _[U]_ [=] _[ S]_ [0] _[u,]_ [˜] _S_ 1 _[D]_ [=] _[ S]_ [0] _[d,]_ [˜]


with corresponding geometric averages



_√_
_G_ _[U]_ = ( _S_ 0 _· S_ 0 _u_ ˜) [1] _[/]_ [2] = _S_ 0



_u,_ ˜ _G_ _[D]_ = ( _S_ 0 _· S_ 0 _d_ [˜] ) [1] _[/]_ [2] = _S_ 0 ~~�~~ _d._ ˜




~~�~~
_u,_ ˜ _G_ _[D]_ = ( _S_ 0 _· S_ 0 _d_ [˜] ) [1] _[/]_ [2] = _S_ 0



The pathwise payoffs are therefore



_V_ _[U]_ = max �0 _, S_ 0 _√_




        -        _u_ ˜ _−_ _K_ - _,_ _V_ _[D]_ = max 0 _, S_ 0 ~~�~~ _d_ ˜ _−_ _K_ _,_


11


and the associated risk-neutral probabilities are


_P_ ( _U_ ) = _p_ [adj] _,_ _P_ ( _D_ ) = 1 _−_ _p_ [adj] _._


Discounting one period at the risk-free rate _r_, the option value at time
0 is




   - _√_
_p_ [adj] max 0 _, S_ 0




        -        - [�]

In this case the geometric feature of the payoff is fully captured by
the two effective averages _S_ 0 _√u_ ˜ and _S_ 0 ~~�~~ _d_ ˜, so the structure remains




~~�~~

the two effective averages _S_ 0 _u_ ˜ and _S_ 0 _d_ ˜, so the structure remains

close to that of a standard one-period binomial model.

For _n_ = 2 there are four possible paths: _UU_, _UD_, _DU_ and _DD_ .
The corresponding terminal prices are


_S_ 2 _[UU]_ = _S_ 0 _u_ ˜ [2] _,_ _S_ 2 _[UD]_ = _S_ 2 _[DU]_ = _S_ 0 _u_ ˜ _d,_ [˜] _S_ 2 _[DD]_ = _S_ 0 _d_ [˜][2] _._


Although _UD_ and _DU_ share the same terminal value, they generate
distinct sequences of intermediate prices and hence distinct geometric


12


averages. Denoting the geometric average associated with a given path
by _G_ [path], a straightforward calculation shows that


_G_ _[UU]_ = _S_ 0 _u,_ ˜ _G_ _[UD]_ = _S_ 0(˜ _u_ [2][ ˜] _d_ ) [1] _[/]_ [3] _,_ _G_ _[DU]_ = _S_ 0( _d_ [˜][2] _u_ ˜) [1] _[/]_ [3] _,_ _G_ _[DD]_ = _S_ 0 _d._ [˜]


The corresponding payoffs are


_V_ [path] = max �0 _, G_ [path] _−_ _K_ - _,_ for path _∈{UU, UD, DU, DD},_


and the path probabilities under _p_ [adj] are given by the usual binomial
expressions,


_P_ ( _UU_ ) = ( _p_ [adj] ) [2] _,_ _P_ ( _UD_ ) = _P_ ( _DU_ ) = _p_ [adj] (1 _−p_ [adj] ) _,_ _P_ ( _DD_ ) = (1 _−p_ [adj] ) [2] _._


Discounting over two periods, the time–0 value is therefore



_V_ 0 = [1]




 - _P_ (path) _V_ [path] _._


path _∈{UU,UD,DU,DD}_




  _r_ [2]



This case already illustrates a key qualitative feature: the stock-price
tree itself recombines, but the geometric average does not, so paths
that meet at the same terminal stock price can yield different option
values.

For _n_ = 3 the number of possible paths increases to 2 [3] = 8. Each
path induces a sequence of stock prices ( _S_ 0 _, S_ 1 _, S_ 2 _, S_ 3) and hence a

Already at this horizon, explicit enumeration becomes unwieldy, and
it is more instructive to describe the general combinatorial structure.

The pattern for general _n_ can be characterised as follows. At time
_i_, the stock price can be written as


_Si_ = _S_ 0 _u_ ˜ _[a][i]_ [ ˜] _d_ _[b][i]_ _,_


where _ai_ and _bi_ denote the cumulative numbers of up and down moves
up to time _i_, satisfying _ai_ + _bi_ = _i_ . For a given path, define



_n_


_bi._

_i_ =0



_A_ (path) =

Since _ai_ + _bi_ = _i_ for each _i_, we have the identity

_A_ (path) + _B_ (path) =

### **4 Bounds for the Arithmetic Asian Op-** **tion Price**


The valuation of an arithmetic Asian option in the CRR framework
is well known to be analytically challenging, even in the absence of
price impact. The difficulty stems from the fact that the arithmetic
average does not preserve the multiplicative structure of the binomial
model, and therefore does not admit recombination in the same way
as the geometric average. Under price impact, this complexity is exacerbated by the dependence of the effective up and down multipliers
on hedging trades. In this section we develop tractable bounds for
the arithmetic Asian call price by exploiting convexity properties of
the average, namely the classical AM–GM inequality and a reverse
AM–GM inequality due to Budimir et al. 2001.
Let _ω ∈{U, D}_ _[n]_ denote a path of up/down moves and let _{Si_ ( _ω_ ) _}_ _[n]_ _i_ =0
be the corresponding sequence of stock prices under the impact-adjusted

and the pathwise call payoffs


_VA_ ( _ω_ ) = max �0 _, An_ ( _ω_ ) _−_ _K_ - _,_ _VG_ ( _ω_ ) = max �0 _, Gn_ ( _ω_ ) _−_ _K_ - _._


We denote by _V_ 0 _[A]_ and _V_ 0 _[G]_ the corresponding option prices at time 0
obtained by discounting risk-neutral expectations under the adjusted
probability measure _Q_ .

#### **4.1 A lower bound**


The first inequality follows immediately from Jensen-type arguments.
Because the arithmetic mean always dominates the geometric mean,
the arithmetic Asian payoff is pathwise larger than the geometric one,
and this relation is preserved under discounting.


**Proposition 4.1** (Lower bound via AM–GM) **.** _For every maturity n,_


_V_ 0 _[A]_ _[≥]_ _[V]_ 0 _[ G][.]_


_Proof._ Since _An_ ( _ω_ ) _≥_ _Gn_ ( _ω_ ) for all paths _ω_, it follows that _VA_ ( _ω_ ) _≥_
_VG_ ( _ω_ ). Taking risk-neutral expectations and discounting yields the
result.


This lower bound is tight and requires no structural assumptions on
the price-impact parameters. It also illustrates a general phenomenon:
price impact affects both the arithmetic and geometric averages, but
their ordering remains preserved.

#### **4.2 Upper bounds**


While the geometric average provides a natural lower bound, obtaining
an upper bound requires more delicate control. A key observation is
that the discrepancy between arithmetic and geometric averages can
be dominated by the range of stock prices along the path. Let


_Sm_ ( _ω_ ) = min _SM_ ( _ω_ ) = max
0 _≤i≤n_ _[S][i]_ [(] _[ω]_ [)] _[,]_ 0 _≤i≤n_ _[S][i]_ [(] _[ω]_ [)]


17


be the extremal prices along the path. A reverse AM-GM inequality
due to Budimir et al. 2001, Proposition 1, yields a multiplicative bound
relating the two averages.


**Proposition 4.2** (Upper bound via reverse AM-GM inequality) **.** _For_
_any path ω ∈{U, D}_ _[n]_ _,_


_An_ ( _ω_ ) _≤_ _Gn_ ( _ω_ ) _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) _,_



_where_




1 [(] _[S][M]_ [(] _[ω]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[S][m]_ [(] _[ω]_ [))][2]
4 _[·]_ _Sm_ ( _ω_ ) _SM_ ( _ω_ )







_ρ_ ( _ω_ ) = exp



_Sm_ ( _ω_ ) _SM_ ( _ω_ )



_._



Combining this bound with the structure of the payoff allows us
to control the difference between the arithmetic and geometric Asian
payoffs. The next result provides a pathwise comparison.


**Proposition 4.3** (Pathwise control of payoff differences) **.** _For every_
_path ω ∈{U, D}_ _[n]_ _,_


_VA_ ( _ω_ ) _−_ _VG_ ( _ω_ ) _≤_ _Gn_ ( _ω_ ) ( _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) _−_ 1) _._


_Proof._ The inequality follows from Proposition 4.2 together with a
simple case distinction on whether _An_ ( _ω_ ) and _Gn_ ( _ω_ ) lie above or below
the strike _K_ .


Taking expectations yields a pathwise upper bound for the arithmetic Asian price, which is sharp but depends on the path-dependent
quantity _ρ_ ( _ω_ ).


**Proposition 4.4** (Pathwise upper bound) **.** _The arithmetic Asian call_
_price satisfies_



_V_ 0 _[A]_ _[−]_ _[V][ G]_ 0 _[≤]_ [1]



_P_ ( _ω_ )    - _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) _−_ 1� _Gn_ ( _ω_ ) _,_

_ω∈{U,D}_ _[n]_




 _r_ _[n]_



_where P_ ( _ω_ ) _denotes the impact-adjusted risk-neutral path probability._


This bound is always tighter than any global bound obtained by
replacing _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) with a uniform constant, but its computation requires
summation over all 2 _[n]_ paths.
To obtain a more tractable bound, we observe that the extremal
prices along any path are themselves bounded by the largest and smallest values attainable in the tree. Under the impact-adjusted CRR
dynamics,
_Sm_ ( _ω_ ) _≥_ _S_ 0 _d_ [˜] _[n]_ _,_ _SM_ ( _ω_ ) _≤_ _S_ 0 _u_ ˜ _[n]_ _,_


18


so that _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) is uniformly dominated by




1 [(˜] _[u][ n][ −]_ _[d]_ [˜] _[ n]_ [)][2]
4 _[·]_ _u_ ˜ _[n]_ [ ˜] _d_ _[n]_







_ρ_ _[∗]_ = exp



_u_ ˜ _[n]_ [ ˜] _d_ _[n]_



_._



This leads to the following global upper bound.



**Proposition 4.5** (Global upper bound) **.** _The arithmetic Asian call_
_price satisfies_



_V_ 0 _[A]_ _[−]_ _[V][ G]_ 0 _[≤]_ _[ρ][∗]_ _[−]_ [1]

_[n]_



E _[Q]_ [ _Gn_ ] _,_
_r_ _[n]_



_where Gn is the geometric average along a random path under the_
_adjusted risk-neutral measure._


The global bound is weaker but computationally simple, depending only on the impact-adjusted factors ˜ _u_ and _d_ [˜] . As _λ_ increases, the
spread between ˜ _u_ _[n]_ and _d_ [˜] _[n]_ widens, making _ρ_ _[∗]_ larger and the bound
looser. Likewise, as _n_ grows, extremal path dispersion increases, causing _ρ_ _[∗]_ to diverge. These effects reflect a fundamental property of
arithmetic averaging: the longer the horizon or the larger the impactinduced price variation, the more the arithmetic average can exceed
the geometric one.


**Theorem 4.1** (Two-sided bounds) **.** _For the arithmetic Asian call op-_
_tion under the impact-adjusted CRR model,_

_V_ 0 _[G]_ _≤_ _V_ 0 _[A]_ _≤_ _V_ 0 _[G]_ [+] _[ρ][∗]_ _[−]_ [1] E _[Q]_ [ _Gn_ ] _._

_r_ _[n]_


Finally, we note that the pathwise bound in Proposition 4.4 always
improves on the global bound.


**Proposition 4.6** (Tightness) **.** _Let_



_A_ := [1]



_P_ ( _ω_ ) ( _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) _−_ 1) _Gn_ ( _ω_ ) _,_ _B_ := _[ρ][∗]_ _[−]_ [1]

_r_ _[n]_

_ω_




 _r_ _[n]_



E _[Q]_ [ _Gn_ ] _._
_r_ _[n]_



_Then A ≤_ _B._


_Proof._ Since _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) _≤_ _ρ_ _[∗]_ for every path and _Gn_ ( _ω_ ) _≥_ 0, summing
against _P_ ( _ω_ ) gives the desired inequality.


19


Taken together, these results show that the geometric Asian price
provides a natural and tight lower bound for the arithmetic Asian
price, while a family of tractable upper bounds can be obtained by
combining reverse Jensen-type inequalities with extremal path bounds.
Pathwise bounds are sharper but computationally expensive, whereas
global bounds are coarser but fully explicit in the price-impact parameters.

### **5 Numerical Illustration**


In this section we present numerical illustrations highlighting the approximation quality of the impact–adjusted CRR scheme when applied
to Asian options.

#### **5.1 Baseline case with no price impact**


Although the model admits no closed-form price in the presence of
price impact, the frictionless case provides a natural benchmark via
the Kemna–Vorst formula (Kemna and Vorst 1990), which yields an
exact price in continuous time for geometric averages under lognormal
dynamics. To assess accuracy, we compute the CRR price for increasing numbers of time steps _n_, keeping the effective up and down factors
fixed, and report its deviation from the Kemna–Vorst benchmark.
Table 1 summarizes the results. The CRR approximation converges towards the benchmark as the number of time subdivisions
increases. The absolute error decreases steadily, and the relative percentage error stabilizes around 6%–7% for moderate values of _n_ .

Table 2 summarizes the results for arithmetic Asian call options.
For arithmetic Asian options we report the upper bounds given in 4.1.
We use the pathwise upper bound from Proposition 4.4. We find that
for smaller values of _n_, the upper bound is closer to the benchmark
price, which suggests bounds may be tighter for small values of _n_ .

#### **5.2 Sensitivity to price impact**

We will now illustrate the sensitivity of our model to price impact.
Table 3 reports geometric Asian prices together with the lower and
upper bounds for the arithmetic Asian call derived. First, the geometric price grows steadily with _λ_ in both regimes, reflecting the convexity
of the payoff in response to increasingly dispersed price paths. Second, the lower bound remains tight (as expected), while the upper
bound expands extremely rapidly with _λ_ . This behaviour is consistent
with the structure of the reverse AM-GM inequality, where the multiplicative factor _ρ_ ( _ω_ ) depends exponentially on the spread between
the pathwise extrema _Sm_ and _SM_ . Because price impact widens this
spread, the bounds deteriorate sharply for moderate to large _λ_ . Finally, the up and down biased cases track each other closely for small
impact levels, but diverge as impact grows.

Table 3: Sensitivity of geometric Asian prices (Geom.) and arithmetic Asian
bounds (LB(A) denotes the lower bound and UB(A) denotes the upper
bound) to the price impact magnitude _λ_, with parameters _S_ 0 = 100 _, K_ =
100 _, r_ = 1 _._ 05 _, n_ = 6. We consider two different hedging volume regimes
which are up-biased ( _vu_ = 1 _._ 3 _, vd_ = 1) and down-biased ( _vu_ = 1 _, vd_ = 1 _._ 3).


Figure 2 illustrates two experiments. In the first (solid red curve),
we vary _v_ _[d]_ while keeping _v_ _[u]_ fixed. In the second (dashed blue curve),
we vary _v_ _[u]_ while keeping _v_ _[d]_ fixed. The behaviour in both cases is
similar for small and moderate volumes. Increasing _v_ _[d]_ continues to
raise the option value, whereas increasing _v_ _[u]_ eventually produces a
mild decline.


22


This asymmetry arises because upward and downward effective
moves enter the geometric mean multiplicatively but with opposite
signs in the price-impact adjustment. Larger _v_ _[u]_ boosts ˜ _u_, steepening the upside branch of the tree, whereas larger _v_ _[d]_ strengthens the
contraction in down moves.


Figure 2: Sensitivity of the geometric Asian call price to hedging volumes.
The solid red curve varies _v_ _[d]_ while holding _v_ _[u]_ = 2 _._ 5 fixed, and the dashed
blue curve varies _v_ _[u]_ while holding _v_ _[d]_ = 2 _._ 5 fixed. Parameter values are
_S_ 0 = 100, _K_ = 100, _u_ = 1 _._ 2, _d_ = 0 _._ 8, _r_ = 1 _._ 05, _λ_ = 0 _._ 1, _n_ = 15.


We now examine how the geometric Asian option price varies with
moneyness ( _K/S_ 0) under different hedging regimes and different levels of permanent price impact. Figure 3 reports option values for
three representative configurations- down-biased hedging ( _v_ _[d]_ _> v_ _[u]_ ),
symmetric hedging ( _v_ _[d]_ = _v_ _[u]_ ), and up-biased hedging ( _v_ _[u]_ _> v_ _[d]_ ).
Across all regimes, option values decrease as the strike increases,
reflecting the monotonicity in moneyness. However, the presence of
price impact induces a systematic upward shift in the level of option
prices.
The magnitude of this effect depends critically on the hedging
asymmetry. Under down-biased hedging, where the market maker
trades more aggressively in down states, the effective down factor _d_ [˜]
becomes smaller, producing greater curvature in the lower branch of


23


the tree. This magnifies path variability and results in the largest sensitivity to _λ_, especially for near-the-money strikes. Symmetric hedging
exhibits an intermediate response, while up-biased hedging generates
a smaller sensitivity, as the impact predominantly steepens the upper
branch of the tree. Interestingly, for high strikes, the three regimes
converge, illustrating that extreme out-of-the-money options are less
sensitive to the interaction between hedging asymmetry and market
impact.


Figure 3: Geometric Asian option prices across moneyness levels ( _K/S_ 0)
under three hedging regimes- down-biased ( _v_ _[d]_ _> v_ _[u]_ ), symmetric ( _v_ _[d]_ = _v_ _[u]_ ),
and up-biased ( _v_ _[u]_ _> v_ _[d]_ ). Each curve corresponds to a different price-impact
coefficient _λ_ . The parameters are, up-biased ( _vu_ = 1 _._ 3 _, vd_ = 1), down-biased
( _vu_ = 1 _, vd_ = 1 _._ 3) and symmetric ( _vu_ = _vd_ = 1), with _S_ 0 = 100, _K_ = 100,
_u_ = 1 _._ 2, _d_ = 0 _._ 8, _r_ = 1 _._ 05, _n_ = 15.

### **6 Conclusion**


This paper develops a tractable framework for valuing Asian options in
a binomial market with permanent price impact. By embedding Kyle
linear market impact into the Cox–Ross–Rubinstein model, we obtain
impact-adjusted up and down factors and a corresponding modified
risk–neutral probability. Within this framework, we derived an exact
pathwise representation for geometric Asian call options.
For arithmetic Asian options, whose exact valuation is intractable
even without impact, we obtain two-sided bounds. The geometric


24


Asian price yields a tight and model-free lower bound, while an explicit upper bound follows from a reverse AM–GM inequality combined with extremal path analysis. Our analysis also characterises
the no-arbitrage region of the impact-adjusted CRR model in terms
of admissible hedging volumes.
The numerical illustrations demonstrates several qualitative features of the model. First, geometric Asian prices increase monotonically with the impact parameter, consistent with the convexity of the
payoff. Second, the arithmetic bounds behave well for small and moderate maturities but become increasingly loose as either the impact
parameter or the horizon grows. Finally, the comparative analysis
with respect to hedging volumes shows an asymmetry between up
and down biased regimes.
Overall, our results provide a computationally tractable approach
to pricing path-dependent options under permanent price impact.
Several extensions could be considered including transient or nonlinear
impact specifications, multi-asset settings, and optimisation of hedging volumes in the presence of execution costs. The binomial structure
developed here could be considered for these extensions.
