I. INTRODUCTION


Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems combined with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques
offer the potential to meet growing data rate demands [1],

[2]. To fully exploit the spatial multiplexing and beamforming
capabilities of MIMO, fully digital beamforming architectures
are required. These architectures enable simultaneous channel
estimation in multiple spatial directions within a single time
interval, significantly reducing the time overhead for link
establishment and making them particularly well-suited for
latency-critical applications [3].
Nevertheless, compared to power-efficient analog or hybrid
beamforming architectures, fully digital beamforming in wideband mmWave systems tends to be significantly more powerintensive. This is primarily due to the fact that each radio
frequency (RF) chain requires a dedicated pair of digital-toanalog converters (DACs) at the transmitter and analog-todigital converters (ADCs) at the receiver. To reduce power

Networks, Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien.



consumption, fully digital beamformers must utilize lowresolution converters [4], which in turn introduce distortion
in both the transmitted and received signals. Therefore, it is
essential to evaluate the performance of such systems under
practical hardware constraints.
The performance of digital mmWave beamforming systems
employing low-resolution quantizers has been explored to
some extent in the literature [5]–[7]. However, these studies are
limited in terms of the range of antenna configurations and/or
the channel conditions considered. Moreover, to the best of the
author’s knowledge, the effect of low-resolution quantization
on advanced mmWave MIMO channel estimation techniques
remains unexplored.
**Contribution:** In this paper, we evaluate the performance
of fully digital low-resolution mmWave MIMO systems for
various channel estimation methods. Our analysis considers
different antenna configurations and varying channel conditions characterized by the Rician _K_ -factor. We investigate the
impact of reduced quantization resolution through simulations
in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE).
**Organization:** Section II describes the system model along
with the adopted quantization noise model. A simulationbased performance evaluation is presented in Section III, and
Section IV concludes the paper.
**Notation:** We use _x_ to denote scalars, **x** for vectors (bold
lowercase), and **X** for matrices (bold uppercase). The _j_ th column of a matrix **X** is denoted by **X** : _,j_ . Transpose
and Hermitian transpose operations are denoted by ( _·_ ) [T] and
(Frobenius norm as _·_ ) [H], respectively. The Euclidean norm is written as _∥·∥F_ and the expectation operator as _∥·∥_ E, the ( _·_ ).

II. SYSTEM MODEL


We study a point-to-point mmWave MIMO system operating in the radiative far-field, assuming perfect synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. The transmitter
is equipped with _M_ Tx and the receiver with _M_ Rx antenna
elements. Each antenna is equipped with its own RF chain,
enabling fully digital beamforming. The system employs timedivision duplex (TDD) to ensure channel reciprocity. Additionally, the system utilizes orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) and quadrature amplitude modulation
with _N_ subcarriers.


At the _n_ -th OFDM subcarrier, the channel matrix is denoted
as **H** [ _n_ ] _∈_ C _[M]_ [Rx] _[×][M]_ [Tx], based on the equivalent complex baseband representation. The channel is modeled as a frequencyselective Rician fading channel based on the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) MIMO channel model, with an
adjustable Rician _K_ -factor [8].


_A. Link Establishment_

Link establishment consists of two phases: training and data
transmission. During the training phase, the wireless channel
is estimated and the resulting channel estimate is used in the
subsequent data transmission phase.
_1) Training Phase:_ In the training phase, known pilot
symbols are transmitted. The input-output relationship is given
by
**y** [ _n_ ] = **H** [ _n_ ] ( _**ϕ**_ [ _n_ ] + **d** [ _n_ ]) + **w** [ _n_ ] _,_ (1)

wheresymbols, **y** [ _**ϕ**_ _n_ ] _∈_ [ _n_ ] _∈_ C _[M]_ [Rx] C _[M][×]_ [1][Tx] represents the unquantized received _[×]_ [1] represents the transmitted pilot
symbols, **d** [ _n_ ] (0 _, σ_ d [2] **[I]** _[M]_ Tx [)][ models impairments from]
_∈CN_
the entire transmit chain as in [9], and **w** [ _n_ ] (0 _, σw_ [2] **[I]** _[M]_ Rx [)]
_∈CN_
is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The pilot
symbols for the _t_ -th transmit antenna are defined as



where **w** q[ _n_ ] �0 _, σ_ q [2] _,_ Rx **[I]** _[M]_ Rx� is the quantization noise
_∈CN_
from the ADC with the power given by


              -               _σ_ q [2] _,_ Rx [= Υ (] _[n]_ [b][) (1] _[ −]_ [Υ (] _[n]_ [b][))][ E] **y** [ _n_ ] 2 _,_ (6)
_∥_ _∥_ [2]

      -       assuming that E **y** [ _n_ ] 2 = 1 + _σw_ [2] [. To enable optimal]
_∥_ _∥_ [2]
beamforming, the estimated channel at the receiver must also
be available at the transmitter. Since the system operates under
a TDD protocol, we leverage channel reciprocity to ensure the
transmitter has access to the same channel estimate.
_2) Data Transmission:_ The channel estimate obtained in
the training phase is processed according to the advanced
channel estimation methods described in [12], [13]. The resulting channel estimate **H** [ _n_ ] is then used for precoding and
combining. To obtain optimal performance in terms of SE, we
apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to **H** [ _n_ ], with its
compact form denoted by



**H** [ _n_ ] = **Q** [ _n_ ] **Σ** [ _n_ ] 


**F** [ _n_ ]�H _._ (7)



In **F** [ (7), _n_ ] _∈_ **Q** C[ _[M]_ _n_ [Tx] ] _∈_ _[×][ℓ]_ [max] C _[M]_ contains right singular vectors, [Rx] _[×][ℓ]_ [max] contains left singular **Σ** ve[ctors, _n_ ] is
the diagonal matrix of singular values ~~_σ_~~ (1)[ _n_ ] _, . . .,_ ~~_σ_~~ ( _ℓ_ max)[ _n_ ]
and _ℓ_ max = min ( _M_ Rx _, M_ Tx) denotes the maximum number of spatial streams. The power loading matrix **P** [ _n_ ] =

  -  diag ~~_p_~~ [ _n_ ] _, . . .,_ ~~_p_~~ [ _n_ ] is optimized via the water



  -  diag ~~_p_~~ (1)[ _n_ ] _, . . .,_ ~~_p_~~ ( _ℓ_ max)[ _n_ ] is optimized via the water
filling algorithm to maximize the transmission rate, while
ensuring compliance with the total transmit power constraint

The input-output relationship for data transmission is given by



_ϕt_ [ _n_ ] =




_ϕ_ [ _n_ ] _, n_ _t, t_ + _M_ Tx _, . . ., N_ _M_ Tx + _t_
_∈{_ _−_ _}_ (2)
0 _,_ else



where _ϕ_ [ _n_ ] are one-dimensional complex symbols drawn
from a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) alphabet.
The transmitter impairments include RF impairments (such
as those from the power amplifier (PA) and local oscillator
(LO) phase noise) with a combined power denoted by _σ_ RF [2] [,]
as well as quantization noise from DAC with power _σ_ q [2] _,_ Tx [[9].]
To model the effect of low-resolution quantization, we adopt
the additive quantization noise model (AQNM), following the
approach used in [6], [10]. Adopting this model, the power of
the quantization noise from the DAC is given by

_σ_ q [2] _,_ Tx [=] Υ ( _n_ b) (1 Υ ( _n_ b)) _,_ (3)
_M_ Tx _−_

wi ~~_√_~~ th the inverse coding gain approximated by Υ ( _n_ b)
_π_ 2 3 _[n]_ b _[−]_ [2] [11], where _n_ b denotes the number of quantization _≈_

bits and Υ ( _n_ b) = 0 corresponds to the ideal case of infinite
quantization resolution. Therefore, the total impairment power
is given by _σ_ d [2] [=] _[ σ]_ RF [2] [+] _[ σ]_ q [2] _,_ Tx [. Since both] **[ d]** [[] _[n]_ []][ and] **[ w]** [[] _[n]_ []][ are]
mutually independent and Gaussian, they can be combined
into a single noise term, we can rewrite (1) as


**y** [ _n_ ] = **H** [ _n_ ] _**ϕ**_ [ _n_ ] + **w** _[′]_ [ _n_ ] _,_ (4)


with **w** _[′]_ [ _n_ ] (0 _, σw_ [2] **[I]** _[M]_ Rx [+] _[ σ]_ d [2] **[R]** [H][)][ and the channel]
_∈CN_   correlation matrix given by **R** H = E **H** [ _n_ ] ( **H** [ _n_ ]) [H][�] . At

the receiver, the channel estimate **H** [ _n_ ] C _[M]_ [Rx] _[×][M]_ [Tx] is

[�]
_∈_
obtained via least-squares (LS) estimation followed by linear
interpolation from the quantized received symbols **y** q[ _n_ ]. The
quantized symbols are obtained by adding the quantization
noise from the ADC, following the AQNM from [6], [10]

_B. Power Consumption Model_


To account for the power efficiency of the converters, as
well as other key components within the RF chains that
significantly contribute to the overall power consumption, we
model the total power consumption of our MIMO transceiver
as _P_ tot = _P_ Tx + _P_ Rx, where _P_ Tx and _P_ Rx denote the
transmitter and receiver power consumptions, respectively. The
transmitter chain consists of DACs, mixers and PAs. The total
transmit power consumption is modeled as [6]


_P_ Tx [mW] = _M_ Tx ( _P_ DC _,_ PA + _P_ LO + 2 _P_ DAC) _,_ (12)

where _P_ DC _,_ PA is the DC power consumption of the PA, _P_ LO
is the power consumption of the mixer (driven by the LO), and
_P_ DAC denotes the power consumed by one DAC. To achieve
a desired effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), the output
power per PA is given by


_P_ out _,_ PA [dBm] = EIRP _−_ 20 log10 ( _M_ Tx) (13)


and the corresponding DC power drawn by the PA is modeled
as [6]



III. SIMULATION-BASED COMPARISON


To evaluate the system performance, we simulate the SE
and EE in a frequency-selective channel. The transmitter and
receiver antenna elements are arranged in a uniform linear
array (ULA) configuration with half-wavelength spacing. The
channel model follows the 3GPP urban macro for the line-ofsight (LOS) scenario with an adjustable _K_ -factor (as outlined
in [8]) and the used simulation parameters are summarized
in Tab. I. As advanced channel estimation methods, we employ
the OOBA-MRC method proposed in [12] and the orthogonal
matching pursuit (OMP) method detailed in [13]. In addition
to the advanced methods, we also include the performance of
conventional baseline method, where the channel estimates is
set as **H** [ _n_ ] = **H** [ _n_ ]. The achievable SE expressed in bits _/_ s _/_ Hz

PA is given by


_P_ in _,_ PA [dBm] = _P_ in _,_ BB _−_ 10 log10 ( _M_ Tx) _−_ _IL_ mix _,_ (15)

where _P_ in _,_ BB is the power delivered by the baseband circuitry
and _IL_ mix is insertion loss (IL) of the mixer. The power
consumption of the DAC is modeled as a function of its
resolution _n_ b (in bits) and sampling rate _f_ s, and is given by [6]


_P_ DAC [mW] = 2 _[n]_ [b] _f_ s FoMDAC _,_ (16)


where FoMDAC denotes the figure of merit of the DAC,
typically expressed in femtojoules per conversion step.
The receiver chain consists of low noise amplifiers (LNAs),
mixers, and ADCs. The total receiver consumption is given
by [6]


_P_ Rx [mW] = _M_ Rx ( _P_ DC _,_ LNA + _P_ LO + 2 _P_ ADC) (17)


where _P_ DC _,_ LNA is the DC power consumption of the LNA
and _P_ ADC denotes the power consumed by one ADC. The
power consumption of the ADC is modeled as a function of
its resolution _n_ b (in bits) and sampling rate _f_ s, and is given
by [6]
_P_ ADC [mW] = 2 _[n]_ [b] _f_ s FoMADC _,_ (18)

Furthermore, _σµ_ [2] [[] _[n]_ []][ represents the diagonal entr][ies][ (vari-]

between the channel gain matrix computed using the estimated
precoder/combiner **G** [ _n_ ], and that obtained using the ideal
precoder/combiner **G** [ _n_ ]. The achievable EE, expressed in
bits _/_ s _/_ Hz _/_ W, is defined by EE = SE _/P_ tot [7].
We analyze the impact of varying antenna configurations
on system performance, with the results in terms of SE
and EE shown in Fig. 1 for an SNR of 0 dB. It can be
observed that SE mainly increases while EE decreases with
the number of antennas, regardless of the employed channel
estimation method or the considered _K_ -factor. Furthermore,
the achievable SE decreases with lower DAC/ADC resolution.
**Results at K-factor of** _−_ **20 dB:** All methods exhibit comparable performance in terms of SE, with the OMP method
showing slightly improved performance as the number of
antennas increases. The highest EE is achieved with 4-bit
quantizer resolution across all channel estimation methods.
Notably, the conventional and OMP methods exhibit higher
EE than the OOBA-MRC method, which requires the support
of the sub-6 GHz MIMO system to achieve comparable SE.

Fig. 1. With a low _K_ -factor (left), lower resolution reduces SE for all methods, while 4-bit quantization yields the highest EE. At high _K_ -factor (right), the
OOBA-MRC is more robust to quantization, with 2-bit and 4-bit quantizers achieving high SE and EE.



**Results at K-factor of 20 dB:** In terms of SE, the
OOBA-MRC method consistently outperforms the conventional method across all MIMO configurations, and exceeds
the OMP method for 8 _×_ 8, 16 _×_ 16, and 32 _×_ 32 configurations.
For 64 _×_ 64, however, OMP achieves higher SE due to resolution mismatch between the sub-6 GHz (8 _×_ 8) and mmWave
arrays, which degrades OOBA-MRC performance. The conventional method suffers noticeable SE loss at lower quantizer
resolutions, while OOBA-MRC and OMP remain more robust.
In terms of EE, the conventional method achieves its best
performance with a 4-bit quantizer, while the OOBA-MRC
and OMP methods attain comparable peak performance using
either 2-bit and 4-bit quantizers. The strong LOS component
enables reliable estimation even at 2-bit resolution. Additionally, both advanced methods outperform the conventional
method in terms of EE across all MIMO configurations.


IV. CONCLUSION


Reducing the quantizer resolution generally leads to a
degradation in SE. However, using 4-bit quantizers provides
the highest EE, thereby offering a favorable trade-off between
power consumption and achievable data rate. At low _K_ factors, all channel estimation methods experience a decline
in SE as the quantizer resolution is reduced. At higher _K_ factors, although conventional and OMP methods experience
performance degradation, the OOBA-MRC method remains
robust and largely unaffected in terms of SE.
