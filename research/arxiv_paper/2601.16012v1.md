Abstract—Sparse superimposed coding (SSC) has emerged
as a promising technique for short-packet transmission in
ultra-reliable low-latency communication scenarios. However,
conventional SSC schemes often suffer from high encoding
and decoding complexity due to the use of dense codebook
matrices. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SSC
scheme by designing a sparse codebook structure, where each
codeword contains only a small number of non-zero elements.
The decoding is performed using the traditional multipath
matching pursuit algorithm, and the overall complexity is
significantly reduced by exploiting the sparsity of the codebook.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves
a favorable trade-off between BLER performance and computational complexity, and exhibits strong robustness across
different transmission block lengths.

I. Introduction


Next-generation wireless networks are required to support ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC),
which serves as a fundamental enabler for time-critical
applications including autonomous vehicles, industrial IoT
systems, and tactile internet services [1]. Traditional
transmission strategies that rely on lengthy data packets face substantial challenges when applied to URLLC
environments. These conventional approaches demand
extensive resource allocation for control signaling, automatic repeat request mechanisms, and error correction
procedures to maintain transmission reliability, consequently resulting in elevated latency and diminished
spectral efficiency. Furthermore, when packet lengths are
reduced, the performance of established coding schemes
deteriorates significantly—LDPC codes exhibit reduced
redundancy while polar codes cannot achieve complete
channel polarization, both leading to compromised reliability. Consequently, developing efficient transmission
techniques for short packets represents a fundamental
challenge in URLLC implementation.
Sparse vector coding (SVC) has been proposed as
a promising approach for short-packet transmission in
URLLC scenarios [2]. Unlike conventional channel coding,



SVC encodes information bits into the non-zero indexes
of a sparse vector, which is then spread to the timefrequency domain for transmission. At the receiver, a
simple energy detection algorithm decodes the signal by
identifying these non-zero indexes. Studies have shown
that SVC outperforms traditional coding schemes in terms
of reliability in short-packet scenarios [2]–[5].
Several variants of SVC have been proposed to enhance
its performance. In [3], an enhanced SVC (ESVC) scheme
has been proposed to improve spectral efficiency by
mapping information bits to both non-zero indices and
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols. In [4],
the SSC leverages multiple constellation alphabets to enhance decoding performance, while further improvements
in block error rate (BLER) are achieved by encoding
additional information into different constellation alphabets [5]. The sparse regression codes (SPARC), which
follow a similar SVC approach, have been explored with
efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoding
algorithms [6]. A generalized SPARC (GSPARC) has been
introduced to improve codeword construction [7], and
block orthogonal sparse superposition codes utilize sequential bit mapping over orthogonal sub-matrices [8]. Our
prior work introduced a block SVC scheme with a block
sparse mapping pattern to enhance decoding performance

[9]. The applicability of SVC has also been extended
to various systems, including multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output [10], low-resolution analog-to-digital converter systems [11], and high-mobility communications

[12].
Most existing SVC schemes [2]–[14] focus on improving
reliability through the design of novel encoding and
decoding algorithms or optimized codebook matrices.
However, these approaches often overlook the computational complexity of SVC, which is a critical factor in
resource-constrained IoT scenarios. Moreover, to ensure
high decoding accuracy, most SVC schemes employ dense
Gaussian or Bernoulli matrices as codebooks, leading to an
exponential increase in codebook size with the number of
transmitted bits. This results in significantly higher encod

ing and decoding complexity as well as storage overhead.
Consequently, designing SVC schemes with sparse codebook matrices that substantially reduce complexity while
maintaining acceptable decoding performance remains an
open research challenge.
In this paper, a low-complexity SSC scheme is proposed
for short-packet URLLC scenarios. A sparse Bernoulli
codebook matrix is designed to substantially reduce the
encoding/decoding complexity of SSC schemes with only
minimal decoding performance degradation. The proposed
sparse codebook matrix enables complexity-performance
trade-offs through a sparsity factor that controls the
proportion of non-zero elements within the codebook
matrix.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
Sections II and III, the encoding and decoding process of
the proposed low-complexity SSC scheme are described,
respectively. In Section IV, the complexity of proposed
decoding algorithm is analyzed. Extensive simulation results are shown in Section V, while conclusions are drawn
in Section VI.

II. Encoding of the Low-Complexity SSC Scheme


In this section, the basic concept of SSC encoding is
introduced, including the sparse mapping pattern, sparse
codebook spreading, and transmission of spread sequence.


A. Sparse Mapping Pattern of SSC


Consider a short-packet communication system where
the information payload comprises _b_ bits per data packet.
As shown in Fig. 1, the _b_ bits are partitioned into two
segments. The _b_ I bits are encoded into the non-zero block
index _B_ of a sparse vector **s** _∈_ C _[N]_ through sparse mapping.
The _b_ S bits are then mapped onto the values of _K_ non-zero
elements of the sparse vector via QAM modulation. Subsequently, the sparse vector is processed through codebook
spreading to generate a spread sequence, which is then
allocated to time-frequency resources for transmission.
The SSC scheme employs a sparse mapping procedure
that allocates the _K_ active entries to _N_ available positions.
Therefore, the number of information bits that can be
carried by the index resource is determined by



According to compressed sensing theory [15], to ensure
successful recovery of the sparse vector, the transmission
block length _M_ must satisfy:



( (
_N_
_M_ = _O_ _K_ log



_K_



))
_._ (5)



⌊
_b_ I = log2



(
_N_
_K_



)⌋
_._ (1)



As indicated in (1), increasing the values of _N_ and _K_
allows the SSC scheme to carry more information bits.
However, a larger value of _K_ leads to a degradation of
the decoding performance, while a larger value of _N_ leads
to a larger size of the codebook matrix. More importantly,
according to (5), the required transmission block length _M_
increases with both _K_ and _N_ further enlarging the size of
the codebook matrix. A large codebook matrix will lead to
a sharp increase in the encoding and decoding complexity
and storage overhead of the SSC scheme [4].
To address this issue, a sparse codebook matrix is
proposed in this paper to reduce the encoding and decoding complexity of the SSC scheme. Specifically, we
first construct a sampling matrix **G** _∈_ R _[M]_ _[×][N]_, where each
column contains only _D_ ( _D ≪_ _M_ ) non-zero elements with
unit values, and the _D_ non-zero elements are randomly
distributed. The sparse codebook matrix is then obtained
by sampling the original codebook (as defined in (4)) using
**G**, given by √



In addition, the number of information bits mapped
onto the _K_ QAM symbol is


_b_ S = _K_ log2( _M_ mod ) _,_ (2)


where _M_ mod is the modulation order.

where _⊙_ denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product
and _R_ = _D/M_ is a sparsity factor that controls the
sparsity of the sparse codebook matrix. An example of
**¯A** for _M_ = 4 and _N_ = 6 is given by

where **Φ** = **FH** T **F** [H] **[ ¯]** **A** is the measurement matrix, **H** T _∈_
C _[M]_ _[×][M]_ denotes the time-domain channel matrix, and **w** _∼_
_CN_ (0 _, σ_ [2] **I** _N_ ) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
vector with variance _σ_ [2] . In static scenario, the channel
remains unchanged over the duration of a transmission
block, thus the time-domain channel matrix **H** T is a cyclic
matrix [16].


B. Low-Complexity Decoding Algorithm


Our goal is to recover the indexes and values of non-zero
elements in the sparse vector **s** from the received signal
**y** . The maximum likelihood (ML) solution of the system
model in (7) can be formulated as


**s** _[∗]_ = arg max Pr( **y** _|_ **s** _,_ **Φ** ) _,_ (10)
_||_ **s** _||_ 0= _K_


where _||_ **s** _||_ 0 is the _ℓ_ 0-norm of **s** . Since our goal is to find
out the support of **s**, we alternatively have


_B_ _[∗]_ = arg min _||_ **y** _−_ **Φs** _B||_ [2] _._ (11)
_|B|_ = _K_


The existing MMP [2] can be used to solve the sparse
recovery problem in (11). Compared to conventional
OMP, the Multipath Matching Pursuit (MMP) algorithm
significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of
sparse signal recovery by exploring multiple candidate
support paths in parallel. However, when applied with
a dense measurement matrix, the MMP algorithm incurs
significantly higher computational cost due to the expensive orthogonal projection


**ˆs** ˆ _B_ [= (] **[Φ]** [T] _B_ ˆ **[Φ]** [ ˆ] _B_ [)] _[−]_ [1] **[Φ]** [T] _B_ ˆ **[y]** _[,]_ (12)


and residual updation


**r** = **y** _−_ **Φ** ˆ _B_ **[ˆs]** [ ˆ] _B_ _[,]_ (13)


which need to be performed in each iteration.
Note that the measurement matrix **Φ** is a sparse matrix
due to the diagonal structure of the equivalent channel
matrix **FH** T **F** [H] . Exploiting this sparsity, the Gram matrix
**U** = **Φ** [T] _B_ ˆ **[Φ]** [ ˆ] _B_ [can be performed element-wise as]

∑
**U** _k,l_ = Φ _[∗]_ _i,k_ [Φ] _[i,l][,]_ (14)

_i∈Sk∩Sl_


where _Sk_ is the non-zero index set of the _k_ -th column of
**Φ** _B∗_, Φ _i,l_ denotes the ( _i, l_ )-th element of **Φ** _B∗_ . Similarly,
the correlation calculation in (13) can be formulated as

∑

[ **Φ** [T] _B_ ˆ **[y]** []] _[k]_ [ =] Φ _[∗]_ _i,k_ _[y][i][.]_ (15)

_i∈Sk_


After obtaining the estimated values of the non-zero
elements of the sparse vector **s**, the demodulation problem
of QAM symbols can be described as

Replacing the codebook matrix **A** in equation (3) with
the sparse codebook matrix **A** **[¯]**, the random spreading
process can be expressed as:

∑ _K_
**x** = (8)

_k_ =1 **[¯a]** _[S][k]_ _[s][k][,]_

where _|Sk|_ = _D_ and **¯a** _Sk_ denote the index set of non-zero
elements and the corresponding non-zero value vector in
the _k_ -th codeword of **A** **[¯]**, respectively.
Fig. 2 shows the encoding complexity of the SSC scheme
as a function of the value of _b_ I. For example, when _R_ = 0 _._ 5,
the encoding complexity using the sparse codebook matrix
can be reduced by more than 50% compared to that of
the original dense codebook matrix.


III. Decoding of the Low-Complexity SSC Scheme
In this section, the decoding algorithm of the lowcomplexity SSC scheme is introduced and its decoding
complexity is analyzed.


A. Transmission of Spread Sequence
The signal **x** is transformed into the time domain via an
inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT), i.e., **x** T = **F** [H] **x**,
where **F** _∈_ C _[N]_ _[×][N]_ is a normalized DFT matrix. To mitigate
inter-symbol interference, a cyclic prefix (CP) of length
_L_ CP is appended to **x** T. At the receiver, after removing
the CP and applying the DFT, the received signal is given
by
**y** = **FH** T **F** [H] **[ ¯]** **As** + **w**

_,_ (9)
= **Φs** + **w**


where _A_ is a QAM alphabet with size _M_ mod. The LLR of
each bit can be calculated as



)



compared to the conventional SSC scheme [4]. However,
when the value of _R_ continues to decrease below this
threshold, the BLER performance deteriorates rapidly.
At larger _R_ values, the proposed SSC scheme achieves
BLER performance very close to that of the conventional
SSC scheme. For instance, when _R_ = 0 _._ 5, the SNR gap
between the proposed scheme and the conventional SSC
scheme is merely approximately 0.2 dB at BLER= 10 _[−]_ [5] .
This indicates that the proposed scheme can substantially
reduce the encoding and decoding complexity of SSC
schemes with only marginal BLER performance sacrifice.
Moreover, the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional SVC scheme [2] when _R >_ 0 _._ 375, demonstrating
superior performance over a wide range of sparsity factors.

where _bk,m_ _∈_ _A_, _∀m_ = 1 _,_ 2 _, · · ·,_ log2( _M_ mod). Note
that the conditional probabilities Pr(ˆ _sk|bk,m_ = 1) and
Pr(ˆ _sk|bk,m_ = 0) are calculated differently for different
modulation orders. The output bit can be given as

_bk,m_ = { 0 _,_ _f_ ( _bk,m_ ) _<_ 0 (18)
1 _,_ _f_ ( _bk,m_ ) _≥_ 0 _[.]_


Finally, the _b_ I bits can be recovered by sparse demapping of the non-zero index set _B_ _[∗]_, while the _b_ S bits can
be obtained after soft demodulation.


C. Complexity Analysis


The computational complexity of the MMP algorithm
varies significantly between dense and sparse codebook
matrices. For dense codebook matrices, the MMP decoding complexity is dominated by two operations: least
squares estimation for non-zero value recovery with complexity _O_ ( _K_ [3] + _MK_ [2] ), and residual update through
matrix-vector multiplication with complexity _O_ ( _NM_ ).
The overall complexity is _O_ ( _K_ [3] + _MK_ [2] + _NM_ ). In
contrast, when employing the proposed sparse codebook
matrix with sparsity factor _R_, the complexity for least
squares is given by _O_ ( _K_ [3] + _RMK_ [2] ). The complexity
of residual update is substantially reduced to _O_ ( _RNM_ )
due to the sparse structure of codebook, leading to an
overall complexity of _O_ ( _K_ [3] + _RMK_ [2] + _RNM_ ). This
analysis demonstrates that the sparse codebook matrix
achieves approximately _R_ -fold complexity reduction in
the decoding algorithm. The complexity reduction is
particularly significant when _NM ≪_ _K_ [2] _M_, which is
typical in practical SSC systems with large codebook
dimensions. For instance, with _R_ = 0 _._ 5, the sparse
codebook matrix achieves approximately 50% complexity
reduction. This substantial complexity reduction makes
the proposed sparse codebook matrix highly attractive
for resource-constrained URLLC applications while maintaining comparable decoding performance.


IV. Simulation Results


The BLER performance of proposed low-complexity
SSC scheme is evaluated in this section. The existing
SVC [2] and SSC [4]schemes are selected for performance
comparison. QPSK modulation is adopted for the SSC
and proposed schemes. The BLER is defined as the ratio
of number of packets received in error to total number of
transmitted packets.
Fig.3 shows the BLER performance of different schemes.
It can be observed that the BLER performance of the
proposed scheme degrades gradually as the sparsity factor _R_ decreases. Notably, for _R ≤_ 0 _._ 25, the proposed
scheme exhibits minimal BLER performance degradation


scheme exhibits similar advantages compared to conventional SVC and SSC schemes as observed in Fig. 3,
confirming the robustness of the performance gains across
different system configurations. These results validate
that the proposed scheme effectively balances the BLER
performance and encoding/decoding complexity for shortpacket transmission across varying transmission bit rates.
Fig. 5 shows the BLER performance of the proposed
scheme versus the sparsity factor _R_ . It can be observed
that the BLER performance deteriorates as the sparsity
factor _R_ decreases. Moreover, a sharp decline in BLER
is observed when _R <_ 0 _._ 3, indicating that decoding
performance benefits significantly from reduced sparsity
in this region. However, when _R >_ 0 _._ 3, the declining trend
of BLER becomes much more gradual. This indicates
that the proposed scheme achieves an optimal tradeoff between decoding performance and computational
complexity around _R_ = 0 _._ 3.

scheme under different sparsity factors _R_ and various block

exhibits BLER performance closely comparable to that
of the conventional scheme across different transmission
block lengths. However, when _R_ = 0 _._ 25, the BLER
performance gap between the proposed and conventional

decreases. This indicates that the proposed scheme with

transmission block lengths.
