**ABSTRACT**


Tri-hybrid beamforming architectures have been proposed to
enable energy-efficient communications systems in extra-largescale antenna arrays using low-cost programmable metasurface
antennas. We study the tri-hybrid beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to improve both
communications and sensing performances. Specifically, we
formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances
communications signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the sensing
power at a target direction, subject to constraints on the total
power consumption and physical limitations inherent to the trihybrid beamforming architecture. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm in which the variables are updated in a closed form
at each iteration, leading to a low-complexity and fast-execution
design. Numerical results show that the tri-hybrid architecture
improves spatial gain and energy efficiency, though with reduced
beam alignment capability compared to conventional hybrid
beamforming architectures.

**1. INTRODUCTION**


Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications enable integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) with
extra-large-scale antenna arrays, supporting ultra-high data rates
and fine sensing resolution [1]. However, conventional digital
beamforming requires a dedicated radio frequency (RF) chain
per antenna, which can incur prohibitively high power consumption and hardware cost, posing significant challenges for ISAC
efficiency [2]. The recently introduced tri-hybrid beamforming (tri-HBF) architecture integrates HBF with programmable
metasurface antennas, enabling the use of more antenna elements
while substantially reducing the number of required RF chains [3].
Consequently, tri-HBF is a promising solution to mitigate the
power consumption bottleneck in mmWave/THz ISAC systems.
Compared with conventional HBF, tri-HBF [3] introduces
reconfigurable antennas as a third beamforming layer, enabling
the compact integration of a large number of reconfigurable elements. In this design, the beamforming is performed across
three domains: digital baseband, analog network, and electromagnetic reconfigurable structures, realized through dynamic
metasurface antennas (DMA) [4] or reconfigurable intelligent



surfaces (RIS) [5, 6]. Recent works [7–10] have investigated
DMA-based ISAC transceivers and demonstrated their potential
benefits. Building on this direction, the tri-HBF architecture
introduces a three-stage beamforming structure that can further
reduce the number of phase shifters compared to HBF solutions
while maintaining high spatial multiplexing gains. Therefore,
tri-HBF can outperform the conventional digital and HBF architecture in energy efficiency (EE) [3,11,12]. However, the tri-HBF
architecture with DMA for ISAC systems remains unexplored, as
most existing works focus on deriving feasible solutions rather
than addressing the joint design and optimization of tri-HBF
beamforming [3, 11, 12]. We are motivated to bridge this gap in
this work.
We consider a mmWave ISAC system with a large antenna
array, implemented using a tri-HBF architecture. We aim to
enhance both communications signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the transmit power toward a direction by jointly optimizing the
digital, analog, and DMA beamformers. The formulated problem
is non-convex and highly challenging because of the constantmodulus constraint on the analog precoding coefficients (as in
the conventional HBF designs) and the additional hardware feasibility constraints imposed by the DMA. To overcome these
challenges, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm that exploits the problem structure to enable closed-form updates of the
beamformers in each iteration, leading to a low-complexity and
fast-execution design. Simulation results demonstrate that the trihybrid architecture significantly enhances the spatial gain and EE
of the communications functionality at a marginal performance
degradation of beam alignment compared to the conventional
HBF schemes. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is
among the first works to optimize tri-hybrid beamformers for
ISAC systems.


**2. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION**


We consider a mmWave mono-static ISAC system, where a
base station (BS) employs a tri-HBF architecture with the DMA
as illustrated in Fig. 1. The BS transmits data signals to one
single-antenna communications user and simultaneously leverage
the signal to probe a specified direction of sensing target. For
simplicity, we assume that the BS employs only one RF chain to
serve the single data stream toward the user.
**Tri-HBF Structure:** Let _w ∈_ C and **f** = [ _f_ 1 _, . . ., fN_ w ] [T] _∈_
C _[N]_ [w] _[×]_ [1] be the digital and analog beamformers at the BS, repec

tively, where _N_ w is the number of waveguides in the DMA. The
analog beamforming coefficients are subject to the unit-modulus
constraints:
_|fi|_ = 1 _,_ _∀i ∈N_ w _,_ (1)


where _N_ w ≜ _{_ 1 _, . . ., N_ w _}_ . Each waveguide of DMA contains _N_ u reconfigurable radiating elements. Thus, there are
_N_ r = _N_ w _N_ u radiating elements in total, indexed by _N_ r =
_{_ 1 _, . . ., N_ r _}_ . Each radiating element captures the signal from
its corresponding waveguide and applies a tunable phase shift
before transmission.
Let **m** = [ _m_ 1 _, . . ., mN_ r] [T] _∈_ C _[N]_ [r] be the vector of the
coefficients associated with all the radiating elements, where [13]

_mj_ = _qjαj,_ _∀j ∈N_ r _._ (2)

Here, _qj ∈_ C represents the propagation gain from the input
port of waveguide to the radiator. This coefficient depends on
the waveguide material properties and can be measured in advance [12], therefore we assume _qj_ is known at the BS. Moreover,
_αj ∈_ C is the tunable coefficient applied by the _j_ -th radiating
element, which satisfies the Lorentzian constraint [14]:

_αj_ = (j + _ψj_ ) _/_ 2 _,_ where _|ψj|_ = 1 _, ∀j ∈N_ r _._ (3)

Since the _N_ u radiating elements in a waveguide share a single
input port, the _N_ r antenna elements are naturally partitioned into
_N_ w subarrays, resulting in a block-diagonal structure of the DMA
beamformer, denoted by [3]


**M** =blkdiag ( **m** 1 _, . . .,_ **m** _N_ w ) _,_ (4)

where **m** _i_ ≜ [ _m_ ( _i−_ 1) _N_ u+1 _, . . ., miN_ u] [T] _∈_ C _[N]_ [u] _, ∀i ∈N_ w.
**Communications Model:** Let _s_ denote the transmit symbol,
with E - _|s|_ [2][�] = 1. The received signal at the communications
user is modeled as

_y_ c = **h** [¯][H] **Mf** _ws_ + _n,_ (5)

where **h** [¯] denotes the channel vector between the BS and the user,
assumed to be known at the BS in our initial analysis herein
(although we admit that its practical estimation is an important
problem on its own), and _n ∼CN_ (0 _, σ_ [2] ) represents the additive
white Gaussian noise with variance _σ_ [2] .The SNR for communications user is given by

SNR = _|_ **h** [H] **Mf** _w|_ [2] _,_ (6)

where **h** ≜ **h** [¯] _/σ_ denotes normalized channel vector.
**Radar Model:** Let ( _θ, ϕ_ ) denote the azimuth and elevation
angles specifying the direction of the sensing target relative to the
BS’s DMA. Denote by **g** ( _θ, ϕ_ ) the corresponding steering vector



at the BS. For ease of exposition, we omit the explicit dependence
on ( _θ, ϕ_ ) in the following. The radar probing signal toward the
target direction is expressed as

_y_ s = **g** [H] **Mf** _ws._ (7)


The transmit power for sensing is computed as [15]:

_P_ sensing = E     - _|y_ s _|_ [2][�] = _∥_ **g** [H] **Mf** _w∥_ [2] _._ (8)


**Problem Formulation:** We jointly design the DMA beamforming matrix **M**, the analog beamforming vector **f**, and the
digital beamforming weight _w_ in the tri-HBF architecture to
achieve high communications SNR and radar sensing power. The
problem of interest is formulated as


max (9a)
_w,_ **f** _,_ **M** _[δ]_ [c] _[|]_ **[h]** [H] **[Mf]** _[w][|]_ [2][ +] _[ δ]_ [s] _[|]_ **[g]** [H] **[Mf]** _[w][|]_ [2]


s.t. (1) _,_ (2) _,_ (3) _,_ (4) (9b)

_∥_ **Mf** _w∥_ [2] _≤_ _P_ t _,_ (9c)

where weights _δ_ c _≥_ 0 and _δ_ s _≥_ 0 control the trade-off between
communications and sensing performance, while _P_ t denotes the
total transmit power budget. Constraints in (9b) represent the
hardware limitations of analog and DMA beamformers while
constraint (9c) enforces the antenna power constraint. For the
design objective in (9), the fully-digital beamforming admits a
closed-form solution. In contrast, problem (9) is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard due to the unit-modulus constraint and the
strong coupling among the optimization variables. We propose
an efficient iterative algorithm that decouples the variables and
derives closed-form solutions for them, as detailed below.


**3. TRI-HYBRID BEAMFORMING DESIGN**


We employ alternating optimization as the general framework to
decouple the design vaiables. Sepecifically, for given **f** and **M**,
we first obtain a closed-form solution to _w_ . Then, the problem
can be simplified into a single-ratio fractional programming,
which is solved by using Dinkelbach’s transform [16]. The whole
procedure is elaborated in the following.


**Problem Reformulation:** For any given analog and DMA
beamformer **f** and **M**, problem (9) is reduced to

_P_ t
max _|w|_ [2][�] _δ_ c _|_ **h** [H] **Mf** _|_ [2] + _δ_ s _|_ **g** [H] **Mf** _|_ [2][�] _,_ s.t. _|w|_ [2] _≤_
_w_ _∥_ **Mf** _∥_ [2] _[,]_

whose optimal solution is any _w_ that satisfies

_|w|_ [2] = _∥_ **Mf** _P_ t _∥_ [2] _[.]_ (10)


By substituting it back into problem (9), we obtain the following
equivalent problem:

_δ_ c _|_ **h** [H] **Mf** _|_ [2] + _δ_ s _|_ **g** [H] **Mf** _|_ [2]
max _,_ s.t. (9b) _,_ (11)
**f** _,_ **M** Tr( **MM** [H] )


where we have used the fact that



_N_ u
��� _m_ ( _i−_ 1) _N_ u+ _jfi_ ��2 = Tr� **MM** [H][�] _._ (12)


_j_ =1



_∥_ **Mf** _∥_ [2] =



_N_ w



_i_ =1


Observing that problem (11) is a single-ratio fractional program,
we adopt the Dinkebach’s transform to recast it as


max
**f** _,_ **M** _[δ]_ [c] _[|]_ **[h]** [H] **[Mf]** _[|]_ [2] [+] _[δ]_ [s] _[|]_ **[g]** [H] **[Mf]** _[|]_ [2] _[−][z]_ [Tr(] **[MM]** [H][)] _[,]_ [ s.t. (][9b][)] _[,]_ [ (13)]

where _z_ is an introduced auxiliary variable. Problem (13) can
be solved by iteratively updating _z_, **f** and **M** . Specifically, in
iteration _t_ + 1, _z_ admits the following closed-form solution:

_z_ [[] _[t]_ [+1]] = [(] _[δ]_ [c] _[|]_ **[h]** [H] **[M]** [[] _[t]_ []] **[f]** [ [] _[t]_ []] _[|]_ [2] [+] _[δ]_ [s] _[|]_ **[g]** [H] **[M]** [[] _[t]_ []] **[f]** [ [] _[t]_ []] _[|]_ [2][)] _,_ (14)

Tr( **M** [[] _[t]_ []] **M** [[] _[t]_ []][H] )


We will derive the updates for **M** and **f** with _z_ fixed.

**DMA and Analog Beamformer Updates:** We first reformulate problem (11) into a more compact form. Specifically, we collect _qj_ and _ψj_ into vectors **q** and _**ψ**_, respectively, such that **m** =
(j **q** + _**ψ**_ _◦_ **q** ) _/_ 2, where _◦_ denotes the element-wise product. With
**H** ≜ blkdiag ( **h** (1 : _N_ u) _, . . .,_ **h** (( _N_ w _−_ 1) _N_ u + 1 : _N_ w _N_ u)),
we obtain
_|_ **h** [H] **Mf** _|_ [2] = _|_ **m** [T] **H** _[∗]_ **f** _|_ [2] = _|_ **m** [H] **Hf** _[∗]_ _|_ [2] = **m** [H] **Hf** _[∗]_ **f** [T] **H** [H] **m** _,_

where ( _·_ ) _[∗]_ denotes the element-wise complex conjugation. Using
this result and with **f** fixed, problem (13) reduces to

max **m** [H] **Am** _−_ _z_ **m** [H] **m** (15a)
**m**

s.t. **m** = (j **q** + _**ψ**_ _◦_ **q** ) _/_ 2 _,_ (15b)


_|_ [ _**ψ**_ ] _m|_ = 1 _, ∀m ∈N_ r _,_ (15c)

where we have denoted **A** ≜ _δ_ c **Hf** _[∗]_ **f** [T] **H** [H] + _δ_ s **Gf** _[∗]_ **f** [T] **G** [H],
and **G** is constructed analogously to **H** .
To solve (15), we add _z_ _**ψ**_ [H] _**ψ**_ to the objective function of
(15), considering that _**ψ**_ [H] _**ψ**_ = _N_ r is satisfied at any feasible
point. With such a transformation, the objective function becomes
convex without loss of optimality. Define _f_ ( _**ψ**_ ) = **m** [H] **Am** _−_
_z_ **m** [H] **m** + _z_ _**ψ**_ [H] _**ψ**_ . With **Q** ≜ diag( **q** ), the gradient vector and
Hessian matrix of _f_ ( _**ψ**_ ) are expressed as

_∇_ _**ψ**_ _f_ ( _**ψ**_ ) = (2 **Am** _−_ 2 _z_ **m** ) _◦_ **q** _[∗]_ + 2 _z_ _**ψ**_ _,_ (16)

_∇_ [2] _**ψ**_ _[f]_ [(] _**[ψ]**_ [) =] **[ Q]** [H] **[AQ]** _[ −]_ _[z]_ **[Q]** [H] **[Q]** [ +] _[ z]_ **[I]** _[.]_ (17)

Since **A** is a semi-positive definite matrix and 0 _< |qm,n| <_
1, the Hessian matrix must be positive definite, justifying the
convexity of _f_ ( _**ψ**_ ) with respect to _**ψ**_ . Based on the first-order
Taylor approximation [17], problem (15) can be approximated at
iteration _t_ as

     -      max _**ψ**_ _ℜ_ _**ψ**_ [H] _∇_ _**ψ**_ _f_ ( _**ψ**_ )�� _**ψ**_ = _**ψ**_ [[] _[t]_ []] _,_ s.t. (15c) _,_ (18)


whose optimal solution is given by


        -         - ��
_**ψ**_ [[] _[t]_ [+1]] = exp j∠ _∇_ _**ψ**_ _f_ ( _**ψ**_ )�� _**ψ**_ = _**ψ**_ [[] _[t]_ []] _,_ (19)


where ∠( **x** ) returns the phases of all the elements of vector **x** .
Then, the DMA beamformer can be obtained based on (15b).

With the other variables fixed, the subproblem with respect
to **f** is written as

max **f** [H] **M** [H] ( _δ_ c **hh** [H] + _δ_ s **gg** [H] ) **Mf** _,_ s.t. (1) _._ (20a)
**f**

By a similar approach as above, we can obtain **f** as


    -     **f** [[] _[t]_ [+1]] =exp j∠ **M** [[] _[t]_ [+1]][H] ( _δ_ c **hh** [H] + _δ_ s **gg** [H] ) **M** [[] _[t]_ [+1]] **f** [[] _[t]_ []][��] _._ (21)

**Overall Design:** The proposed low-complexity tri-HBF design is summarized in Algorithm 1. Specifically, given a feasible
initial point _{_ **M** [[0]] _,_ **f** [[0]] _}_, the auxiliary variable _z_, the DMA beamformer **M**, and the analog beamformer **f** are iteratively updated
in each iteration until the objective value in (9) converges, as
seen in steps 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The objective value is
non-decreasing after each update and bounded on the feasible
set, ensuring monotone convergence. This will be numerically
confirmed in the simulation results. The complexity of Algorithm
1 is dominated by the update of the DMA beamformer **m** in
(19). This requires a complexity of _O_ ( _N_ r [2][)][. Thus, the overall]
complexity of Algorithm 1 is _O_ ( _IN_ r [2][)][, where] _[ I]_ [ is the number of]
iterations.


**4. SIMULATION RESULTS**


**Simulation Setup:** In this section, we numerically evaluate the
proposed design. We set _N_ u = 16 _, N_ w = 8 _, P_ t = 10 dBm and
the noise variance is _σ_ [2] = 0 dBm. We consider a DMA-based BS
operating at a carrier frequency of _fc_ = 28 GHz corresponding
to a wavelength of _λc_ = 1 _._ 07 cm. The inter-waveguide spacing
is set to _λc/_ 2 while the spacing between adjacent rading elements
is _λc/_ 5 [18]. Following [13], the propagation gain is modeled
as _qj_ = _e_ _[−][d][j]_ [(] _[ν]_ [+j] _[ϖ]_ [)], where _dj_ denotes the physical distance
between the input and the element, _ν_ = 0 _._ 6 m _[−]_ [1] is the attenuation coefficient, and _ϖ_ = 827 _._ 67 m _[−]_ [1] is the wavenumber. The
channel vector is modeled using the Saleh–Valenzuela scattering
model [19]. The _N_ r DMA components are arranged in a rectangular shape, similar to a uniform planar array (UPA). Thus,
the DMA steering vectors are identically modeled as those for
UPAs [20]. The azimuth angle _θ_ is independently drawn from the
uniform distribution _U_ ( _−π/_ 3 _, π/_ 3), while the elevation angle
_ϕ_ is sampled from _U_ ( _π/_ 6 _,_ 5 _π/_ 6). All the simulation results are
averaged over 100 independent channel realizations.
Fig. 2 illustrates the convergence behavior as well as the required run time until convergence for Algorithm 1 under different
weight coefficients. For comparison, we include the baseline
“DT-Man”, wherein subproblems (15) and (20) are solved using
a manifold-based conjugate gradient method [21]. We show the
convergences for different values of _δ_ c with _δ_ s = 1 _−_ _δ_ c. Note
that in this figure, each marker corresponds to every second optimization iteration. The objective value is plotted starting from the
first iteration, and the initial value is omitted. As observed, the
proposed algorithm consistently achieves a monotonic increase

in the objective value and converges rapidly and stably. Moreover,
Algorithm 1 requires a comparable number of iterations as the DTMan scheme but converges significantly faster in terms of CPU
time. This is because DT-Man typically performs line search to
determine a suitable step size, while our proposed method enable
updating beamformers with closed-form solutions.


Fig. 3 shows the tradeoff between communications and sensing performances under different transceiver architectures. The
achievable rate is computed as log2(1 + SNR), and the EE is
obtained based on the power consumption model in [13], with details omitted due to space limitations. We compare the proposed
tri-HBF to fully digital (FD) and HBF architectures. In FD, each
antenna has a dedicated RF chain, while in HBF, antennas connect
to independent phase shifters that share one RF chain. Owing to
the reduced inter-element spacing of DMA ( _λc/_ 5 vs. _λc/_ 2), we
consider these two baseline architectures in two configurations:
(i) same number of antennas (SN) and (ii) same antenna aperture
with fewer radiating elements (SA).


In Fig. 3(a), we show the tradeoff between the communications achievable rate and sensing power of the considered
schemes. As expected, the achievable communications rate decreases when sensing power increases. It is observed that the
tri-HBF architecture exhibits a strictly smaller tradeoff region
than FD SN and HBF SN, mainly due to the physical limitations
of DMA, including waveguide loss, beamforming constraints,
and the subarray structure. However, tri-HBF attains higher
communications rates owing to its larger number of radiating
elements, which provide a greater spatial gain than the FD SA

to the number of radiating elements per waveguide _N_ u.


and HBF SA architectures. In contrast, FD SA and HBF SA
achieve higher sensing power, since this metric primarily reflects
beam alignment quality, i.e., how well the transmit beam aligns
with the steering vector. Fig. 3(b) further presents the tradeoff
between communications EE and sensing power. It is clear that
the tri-HBF architecture outperforms the compared benchmarks
in EE. This is due to the low-power consumption of DMAs and is
aligned well with the findings in [3, 12].
Fig. 4 illustrates the performance comparison of different
architectures for _N_ u _∈{_ 8 _,_ 16 _, . . .,_ 48 _}_ . Following Fig. 3(a),
we fix the weight as _δ_ c = 0 _._ 075 to balance the performance of
communications and sensing functionalities. Fig. 4(a) presents
the tradeoff between EE and achievable rate. It can be observed
that the proposed tri-HBF architecture achieves substantially
higher EE compared with HBF and FD, particularly in the extremely large-scale regime. As the achievable rate increases, the
EE of tri-HBF improves linearly. This is because the achievable
rate grows significantly while the additional elements do not
introduce extra hardware power consumption. What is more, for
HBF and FD, the EE first increases notably and then gradually
decreases. Fig. 4(b) further depicts the sensing power versus
_N_ u. In general, the sensing power decreases for all architectures
as _N_ u increases. This is because the improved channel gain of
communications links strengthens the SNR, which dominates the
objective function in beamforming design.


**5. CONCLUSION**


We proposed a tri-HBF architecture for mmWave ISAC system
with a large antenna array, where digital, analog, and DMA-based
beamformers are jointly optimized. By formulating a weighted
sum of communications SNR and sensing power, we developed
an efficient iterative algorithm with closed-form beamformer
updates. Simulation results show the proposed design achieves
low computational complexity, fast runtime, stable convergence,
and significantly improved communications EE and sensing
power compared to conventional architectures, while maintaining
competitive communications performance. Future work will
extend this design to multi-user, multi-target scenarios, aiming
to maximize system-wide sum-rate and sensing accuracy, while
addressingpracticalchallengessuchasprecisechannelestimation
and inter-user interference management.
