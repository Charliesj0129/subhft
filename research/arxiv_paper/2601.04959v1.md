**Abstract**


A quantitative understanding of the stochastic dynamics in limit order price changes is essential
for meaningful advances in market microstructure research and effective execution strategy design. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical analysis of intraday limit order price
change transition dynamics, treating ask and bid orders separately across different market capitalization tiers. Using high-frequency tick data from NASDAQ100 stocks, we employ a discrete-time
Markov chain framework to analyze the evolution of price adjustments throughout the trading day.
We categorize consecutive price changes into nine distinct states and estimate transition probability
matrices (TPMs) for six intraday intervals across High ( `HMC` ), Medium ( `MMC` ), and Low ( `LMC` ) market capitalization stocks. Elememt-wise comparison of TPMs reveals systematic intraday patterns:
price inertia i.e. self-transition probability, peaks during opening and closing hours, stabilizing at
lower levels during midday. A pronounced capitalization gradient is also observed: `HMC` stocks
exhibit the strongest price inertia, while `LMC` stocks demonstrate significantly lower stability and
pronounced bid-ask spread. Markov chain metrics, including spectral gap, entropy rate, and mean
recurrence times quantify these dynamics. Clustering analysis identifies three distinct temporal
phases on the bid side – Opening, Midday, and Closing and four phases on the ask side – Opening, Midday, Pre-Close, and Close, indicating that sellers initiate end-of-day positioning strategies
earlier than buyers. Stationary distributions reveal that limit order dynamics are predominantly
characterized by neutral and mild price changes. Furthermore, Jensen-Shannon divergence computed between stationary distributions across time-intervals confirms the closing hour as the most
distinct phase, with capitalization modulating the intensity of temporal contrasts and the degree
of bid-ask asymmetry. These findings advance the understanding of evolving intraday limit order
pricing behavior, offering direct applications for capitalization-aware and time-adaptive execution
algorithms and risk management frameworks.

**1. Introduction**


In equity markets, limit orders represent a critical component of the trading ecosystem, allowing traders to specify precise execution prices while contributing to market liquidity [1, 2, 3, 4].
Unlike market orders that execute immediately at prevailing prices, limit orders remain active
in the order book until matched or canceled. This creates a dynamic environment in which the
intraday evolution of limit order prices is driven by traders’ continuous strategic adjustments to
liquidity conditions, information arrival, and prevailing market sentiment [5, 6, 7, 8]. These adjustments manifest as sequences of discrete price revisions, generating complex stochastic dynamics
with systematic intraday regularities [9, 10].
The nature of these adjustments is fundamentally asymmetric: buy limit orders compete by improving prices toward the ask, while sell limit orders compete by lowering prices toward the bid,
reflecting their opposing economic objectives and inventory considerations [11, 12]. Understanding how these distinct buy- and sell-side price revision mechanisms evolve over the trading day
therefore represents a central challenge in market microstructure research, with direct implications
for algorithmic trading design, liquidity provision, and market efficiency.
Beyond intraday temporal effects, market capitalization plays a crucial role in shaping limit
order pricing behavior and the associated price change dynamics. High-capitalization stocks typically exhibit frequent but relatively small price adjustments, reflecting dense order books, intense
competition among liquidity providers, and narrow bid–ask spreads [6, 1, 8]. In such environments, traders engage in fine price shading to maintain queue priority while minimizing execution
costs [7, 4]. Medium-capitalization stocks display intermediate liquidity conditions, with more
pronounced variability in price changes due to less predictable order flow and reduced market
depth [2, 3]. In contrast, low-capitalization stocks are characterized by sparse order books, wider
spreads, and heightened information asymmetry, leading to less frequent but larger price revisions,
often triggered by liquidity shocks or information events [10, 9, 5]. These capitalization-dependent
features suggest that limit order price changes are governed by distinct stochastic mechanisms
across market segments, thereby motivating a stratified analytical approach.
A substantial body of literature has documented intraday regularities in financial markets
across multiple dimensions, including trading volume [13], transaction patterns [14], liquidity
provision [15], and bid–ask spread dynamics [16]. Market microstructure studies have further emphasized the role of order types in shaping these patterns [6, 4, 2, 3], stimulating extensive research
on order book resilience, transaction costs, and strategic liquidity provision [1, 7]. Within this
framework, empirical evidence shows that limit order submission strategies vary systematically
over the trading day [17, 18], with distinct regimes at the market open, midday, and close [19, 20].
The rise of high-frequency and algorithmic trading has further amplified these temporal patterns,
leading to clustering in price revisions and sequential price improvement behavior [3, 21, 22]. Despite this extensive literature, a critical gap remains. To the best of our knowledge, no existing
study has systematically examined the intraday evolution of limit order price change transitions,

treating buy and sell orders separately and jointly accounting for both intraday timing and market
capitalization effects.
Addressing this gap requires a modeling framework capable of capturing the discrete, statedependent nature of sequential price adjustments. Stochastic approaches based on Markov chains
are particularly well suited for this purpose, having proven effective in the analysis of discrete
financial processes [23, 24] and widely applied in market microstructure settings [25, 26, 12, 27].
While our prior works [28, 29] employed discrete-time Markov chains to study intraday order
transitions, it treated order types in aggregate and did not explicitly focus on the dynamics of price
revisions within limit orders. The present study extends this line of research by shifting the analytical focus to the intraday transition dynamics of limit order price changes themselves. Specifically,
we investigate how these transitions evolve across trading hours and market capitalization tiers,
and how they differ between the bid and ask sides of the order book.
Building on our established methodology [28, 29], we develop a discrete-time Markov chain
(DTMC) framework to analyze limit order price change transitions using high-frequency tickby-tick data for NASDAQ100 stocks. Consecutive limit order price changes are classified into
nine discrete states based on their magnitude and direction, yielding categorical time series that
capture the sequential nature of pricing decisions. For each intraday interval τ ∈{ `T1`, `T2`, . . ., `T6` }
and market capitalization tier _c_ ∈{ `HMC`, `MMC`, `LMC` }, we estimate transition probability matrices _P_ [(] _ij_ [τ,] _[c]_ [)]
describing the likelihood of transitioning from state _i_ to state _j_ . Treating bid and ask limit orders
separately allows us to explicitly account for directional asymmetries in price revision behavior.
Employing this DTMC framework, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of transition probabilities, stationary distributions, and key Markov chain metrics, including spectral gap,
entropy rate, and mean recurrence time. We further investigate cross-interval similarities using
clustering techniques and Jensen–Shannon divergence. Our results reveal pronounced intraday
regularities, with price inertia peaking at the market open and close, and a clear capitalization
gradient whereby high-capitalization stocks exhibit the greatest stability and low-capitalization
stocks the highest degree of dynamism. Clustering analysis uncovers distinct Opening, Midday,
and Closing regimes on both sides of the book, with an additional pre-close phase emerging on the
ask side. Stationary distributions indicate that limit order dynamics are dominated by neutral and
mild price changes, while the closing hour stands out as the most distinct temporal regime, with
capitalization modulating the intensity of intraday contrasts and bid–ask asymmetry.
The primary contribution of this paper is to provide the first data-driven Markov chain analysis of intraday limit order price change transition dynamics across market capitalization tiers. By
extending existing intraday order transition frameworks to the granular pricing behavior within
limit orders, our study offers new empirical insights into how time of day, market size, and order
direction jointly shape limit order price dynamics. These findings have direct implications for
time-adaptive and capitalization-aware execution strategies. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and intraday segmentation. Section 3 presents the
methodological framework. Section 4 reports the empirical findings, while Section 5 discusses
their robustness and implications. Section 6 concludes and outlines directions for future research.

**2. Data**


_2.1. Data Description_

The availability of high-frequency, micro-level stock market data has unlocked unprecedented
capabilities for granular empirical research in financial markets. We use tick-by-tick order sub[mission data obtained from Algoseek in this study. The data cover all order types placed from](https://www.algoseek.com)
04:00:00 to 20:00:00 Eastern Standard Time (EST) for stocks listed in the NASDAQ100 index.
Each trading day typically contains hundreds of millions of records, with raw CSV files of roughly
20–40 GB. Table 1 presents the dataset structure, with eight columns: Date, Timestamp, Order ID,
Event Type, Ticker Symbol, Price, Quantity, and Exchange.

Our empirical analysis focuses on the two event types – ADD-ASK and ADD-BID order types,
which correspond to the submission of new ask (selling) and bid (buying) limit orders, respectively. For each order type, we compute price differences between consecutive orders, then categorize these differences into discrete states, as presented in Table 4, that define our Markov chain
framework. The primary objective is to estimate the probabilities of transition between successive
limit-order price change states, with a particular focus on their intraday dynamics and variation
across different market capitalization tiers. The following subsection explains the segmentation of
a trading day for the intraday analysis and selected the stocks for each market capitalization tier.


_2.2. Stock Selection and Time-Interval Division_

For each market capitalization tier – High Market Capitalization ( `HMC` ), Medium Market Capitalization ( `MMC` ), and Low Market Capitalization ( `LMC` ), we select five stocks; extract tick data for
these five stocks separately from the full raw data shown in Table 1. The stock selection follows a
stratified approach across the capitalization tiers: for `HMC`, we consider ranks 1 _[st]_ –20 _[th]_ and choose
five stocks from distinct sectors to limit sector bias; similarly, we select five stocks from ranks
41 _[st]_ –60 _[th]_ for `MMC`, and 81 _[st]_ –100 _[th]_ `LMC`, as shown in Table 2. This analysis spans 12 trading days,
balanced between six days where the NASDAQ100 index closed higher than its opening price (0711-2018, 15-11-2018, 28-11-2018, 06-12-2018, 10-12-2018, 26-12-2018) and six days where it
closed lower (09-11-2018, 12-11-2018, 14-11-2018, 04-12-2018, 07-12-2018, 21-12-2018), a design that mitigates the risk of our results being driven by a single market trend. The entire process

of data extraction and preprocessing was performed efficiently using EmEditor, a tool capable of
handling the multi-gigabyte files involved.

To analyze the intraday patterns of limit order price change dynamics for these stocks, we
segment the trading hours i.e. 09:30:00.000 − 16:00:00.000, into six distinct intervals as shown in
Table 3. All intervals span one hour except `T3` and `T4` which are 75 minutes to accommodate the
distinctive, often less volatile, patterns of the mid-day trading period.

`T6` 15:00:00.000 - 16:00:00.000 60


The combination of time-based segmentation and capitalization-tiered stock selection across
diverse sectors and trading days creates a powerful, two-dimensional framework for comparative
analysis.


**3. Methodology**


Having established the stock selection and time segmentation protocol, we now present the
methodological framework for analyzing intraday limit order price change dynamics using highfrequency tick-by-tick data. The framework is designed to: (i) verify whether consecutive price


5


changes exhibit short-range dependence using the G-test of independence, (ii) conditional on detecting dependencies, model the resulting state-to-state revision mechanism through a discretetime Markov representation, and (iii) summarize and compare intraday dynamics across time intervals and market capitalization tiers, separately for bid and ask submissions. Finally, we complement transition-based analysis with metrics, similarity-based comparisons of transition matrices,
and stationary behavior to provide both local (one-step) and global (long-run) views of limit order
price revision dynamics.


_3.1. G-test of Independence_
To validate the presence of memory effects in high-frequency limit order price changes, we employ the G-test of independence [30, 31]. This likelihood ratio test evaluates whether consecutive
price changes exhibit statistical dependence, a prerequisite for Markov chain modeling. Operationally, the test is applied to the contingency table of consecutive state transitions constructed
within each intraday time interval and capitalization tier, and performed separately for the bid and
ask sides.
The test examines the null hypothesis of independence against the alternative of dependence:


_H_ 0 : Consecutive price changes are independent (1)
_H_ 1 : Consecutive price changes exhibit dependence (2)


The G-statistic quantifies the likelihood ratio between observed and expected frequencies under independence:




     - _Oi j_
_Oi j_ ln
_i_, _j_ _Ei j_




 _G_ = 2



_Ei j_




, (3)



where _Oi j_ represents observed transition frequencies from state _i_ to state _j_, and _Ei j_ denotes expected frequencies under independence:


_k_ _[O]_ _ik_ [)(][�] _k_ _[O]_ _k j_ [)]
_Eij_ = [(][�] ~~�~~ . (4)
_k_, _l_ _[O]_ _kl_


Under _H_ 0, the G-statistic follows a χ [2] distribution with ( _r_  - 1)( _c_  - 1) degrees of freedom, where
_r_ and _c_ are the dimensions of the transition matrix. We reject _H_ 0 at the 5% significance level if
the resulting p-value falls below 0.05. Rejection of the independence hypothesis indicates that
limit order price changes exhibit statistically significant short-range dependence. Consistent with
this evidence, we model the sequences using first-order Markov dynamics, where the next state
depends only on the current state. This step provides a formal statistical basis for the Markov
chain analysis and ensures that the subsequent estimation of transition matrices captures genuine
temporal structure rather than sampling noise.


_3.2. Discrete-Time Markov Chain for Limit Order Price Changes_
Markov chain belongs to a category of stochastic processes that are highly effective in describing sequences of categorical events [28, 32]. We employ a discrete-time Markov Chain (DTMC)


6


to model the dynamics of limit order price changes. A DTMC is a stochastic process comprising a series of random variables _X_ 1, _X_ 2, . . ., _Xn_ that obeys the Markov property [33], meaning the
probability of transitioning to any future state _Xn_ +1 depends solely on the current state _Xn_ and is
independent of all previous states [34]. In our setting, _Xn_ represents the categorical state of the _n_ th consecutive limit order price change for a fixed quote side, intraday interval, and capitalization
tier.
To apply this framework, we first categorize limit order price changes into nine distinct states
based on their percentage deviation from the previous limit order price, as defined in Table 4. The
set of possible states is therefore _S_ = _S_ 1, _S_ 2, . . ., _S_ 9. This discretization preserves both direction
and magnitude of revisions while enabling stable estimation of transition probabilities in a highfrequency setting.


Table 4: Categorization of limit order price change for Markov chain states.



**Markov**
**State**



**Price Change** **Price Change Category**



_S_ 1 >-5.0% A: Very Aggressive Sell
_S_ 2 -5.0% to -2.0% B: Aggressive Sell
_S_ 3 -2.0% to -1.0% C: Moderate Sell
_S_ 4 -1.0% to -0.01% D: Mild Sell
_S_ 5 0.0% E: Neutral
_S_ 6 +0.01% to +1.0% F: Mild Buy
_S_ 7 +1.0% to +2.0% G: Moderate Buy
_S_ 8 +2.0% to +5.0% H: Aggressive Buy
_S_ 9 >+5.0% I: Very Aggressive Buy


The core component of the first-order DTMC is the transition probability _pi j_, which represents
the probability of the price change transitioning from the current state _S i_ to state _S j_ in the next
time step [28]:
_pij_ = _P_ ( _Xn_ +1 = _S j_ | _Xn_ = _S i_ ) (5)


The complete probability distribution of transitions between all states is concisely represented
by a transition probability matrix, **P** :



_p_ 11 _p_ 12 - · · _p_ 19
_p_ 21 _p_ 22 - · · _p_ 29
... ... ... ...
_p_ 91 _p_ 92 - · · _p_ 99



(6)




**P** =







This matrix is subject to the constraints:


0 ≤ _pi j_ ≤ 1, ∀ _i_, _j_ ∈ _S_, (7)


9

     
_pi j_ = 1, ∀ _i_ ∈ _S_ . (8)
_j_ =1


7


To estimate the elements _pij_ of the matrix **P**, we use the Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(MLE) method [34, 35]. We estimate transition matrices separately for each intraday interval and
market capitalization tier, and for each quote side. A modified MATLAB code is used for this
estimation, with the original version available in Ref. [36]. These matrices capture the step-bystep dynamics of limit order price adjustments and enable systematic comparisons across time
intervals. To translate transition patterns into interpretable market features, we next compute metrics that summarize persistence and randomness. This stratified estimation design isolates (i)
within-day temporal effects, (ii) capitalization effects, and (iii) bid–ask asymmetries in a unified
probabilistic framework.


_3.3. Markov Chain Dynamics Metrics_
Beyond transition probabilities, several metrics derived from the transition matrix **P** characterize the dynamics of limit order price change processes, as listed below. We use these summaries
to compare how quickly price revision behavior stabilizes, how predictable it is given the current
state, and how frequently different degrees of aggressiveness occur.


_3.3.1. Spectral Gap and Relaxation Time_
The spectral gap γ measures the convergence rate to the stationary distribution π given later in
Eq. 14, defined as the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of **P** [37, 38]:


γ = 1 −|λ2|, (9)


where λ1 = 1 and λ2 is the second-largest eigenvalue in magnitude, with relaxation time τ defined
as:
τrel = [1] (10)

γ [.]

A large spectral gap indicates rapid convergence to equilibrium with short-lived memory effects.
Small gaps suggest persistent patterns and slower convergence to steady-state behavior.


_3.3.2. Entropy Rate_
The entropy rate quantifies the average information content per transition for a stationary
Markov chain, defined as [39]:



9


_pi j_ log _pi j_ . (11)
_j_ =1



_H_ (X) = −



9


π _i_
_i_ =1



High entropy rates indicate unpredictable price change sequences, while low rates suggest structured, predictable patterns given the current state.


_3.3.3. Mixing Rate_
The mixing rate describes convergence speed to the stationary distribution π in Eq. 14 from
arbitrary initial conditions, bounded by [38, 40]:

∥ **p** [(] _[n]_ [)]                   - π∥TV ≤ _Ce_ [−] _[n]_ [/τ][rel], (12)


where **p** [(] _[n]_ [)] is the state distribution after _n_ steps. Fast mixing implies rapid dissipation of initial
shock effects, while slow mixing indicates persistent path-dependency in price formation.


8


_3.3.4. Mean Recurrence Time_
For each state _S i_, the mean recurrence time represents the expected return interval [41]:


µ _i_ = [1], _i_ = 1, 2, . . ., 9. (13)

π _i_


µ _i_ values reveal typical cycles of order price aggressiveness, with small µ _i_ for neutral states indicating frequent orders at current market prices and large values for extreme states reflect rare
aggressive adjustments constrained by market impact.
While these metrics effectively quantify the overall dynamic properties, they do not capture the
structural similarity between entire transition matrices. To systematically group distinct trading
behaviors based on their full probabilistic structure, we reduce the transition data into a lowerdimensional representation suitable for clustering, as detailed in the next subsection. Accordingly,
we treat the embedding and clustering steps as complementary tools for comparing entire matrices
across time intervals and quote sides, rather than as core modeling contributions.


_3.4. Dimensionality Reduction of the TPMs_

To derive low-dimensional embeddings of the 9 × 9 transition probability matrices (TPMs),
each TPM is vectorized into **x** ∈ R [81] and reduced in two stages. First, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [42] and retain the top _k_ = 8 components (capturing over 95% of the variance), which provides a compact representation and stabilizes the subsequent embedding. Second,
the PCA-reduced data are mapped into two dimensions using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) [43, 29] to obtain a visualizable representation of similarities across TPMs.


_3.5. Clustering Techniques for Dimension-Reduced TPMs_

To summarize latent structures in the dimension-reduced TPM embeddings, we apply two
complementary clustering algorithms using the `scikit-learn` library [44]. First, we use Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering with Ward’s minimum-variance linkage [45] to obtain a dendrogram that highlights nested similarity patterns between time intervals. Second, we use DBSCAN [46, 29] to identify dense groups and potential outliers in the embedding space. These
algorithms allow us to group trading time intervals into naturally occurring behavioral phases.


_3.6. Stationary Distribution Analysis_

In an ergodic Markov chain, the long-run behavior is characterized by a stationary distribution, which specifies the steady-state probability associated with each state. Denoting the longterm probability of being in state _j_ by π _j_, this stationary vector is uniquely determined and must
satisfy [47, 28]:



π _j_ =



9


π _i_ _pi j_ (balance equation), (14)
_i_ =1



9


π _j_ = 1 (Normalization condition). (15)
_j_ =1


9


The stationary probabilities π _j_ are computed using the `PyDTMC` package [48]. To quantify
differences between stationary distributions across time intervals, we employ the Jensen–Shannon
Divergence (JSD). For two probability distributions _p_ and _q_ (each non-negative and summing to
one), the JSD is defined as [49]:




- - _p_ + _q_
+ KLD _q_
����� 2



JSD( _p_, _q_ ) = [1]

2




- - _p_ + _q_
KLD _p_
����� 2



��
, (16)



where the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) between two discrete distributions _u_ and _v_ is


        - _ui_
KLD( _u_ ∥ _v_ ) = _ui_ log2 _vi_ . (17)

_i_


In this formulation, _ui_ and _vi_ correspond to the probabilities assigned to state _i_ by the distributions _u_ and _v_, respectively. The Jensen-Shannon Divergence is symmetric by definition, takes
only non-negative values, and becomes zero precisely when the two distributions coincide [50].
This distributional analysis enables us to characterize the stable, long-run profile of limit order
price revisions and quantify the magnitude of behavioral shifts between different trading intervals.
With this comprehensive methodological framework established in Section 3, we now proceed to
Section 4 to detail the empirical findings derived from the NASDAQ100 dataset.


**4. Results**


How do price adjustments for ask and bid limit orders evolve intraday, and how are these
dynamics shaped by market capitalization? To answer this central question, this section presents
the empirical results from our discrete-time Markov chain framework. The findings are structured
to provide a comparative analysis across the six distinct trading intervals ( `T1` - `T6` ) and the three
market capitalization tiers: High ( `HMC` ), Medium ( `MMC` ), and Low ( `LMC` ).
We begin in Subsection 4.1 by applying the G-test of independence to validate the presence
of short-term memory in price change sequences, establishing that current price adjustments depend statistically on preceding events, thereby justifying the Markov chain modeling approach.
Subsection 4.2 examines the structure and dominant elements of the estimated transition probability matrices (TPMs), conducting systematic comparisons both temporally and cross-sectionally
across the capitalization tiers. The analysis in Subsection 4.3 quantifies the dynamic properties
of these TPMs through key Markov chain metrics including entropy rate, spectral gap, relaxation
time, and mean recurrence times, revealing how convergence speed and predictability patterns
vary across temporal and capitalization-size dimensions. Subsection 4.4 employs dimensionality
reduction techniques i.e. Principal Component Analysis and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, followed by clustering analysis with Hierarchical and DBSCAN algorithms to identify
latent structural patterns and classifications within the high-dimensional TPMs. Finally, Subsection 4.5 analyzes the stationary distributions of limit order price change states across time-intervals
and capitalization tiers, utilizing Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify distributional differences
and assess the stability of long-term adjustment patterns.

_4.1. G-test of independence_

To validate the use of Markov chains, we test for temporal dependence by applying the G-test
of independence and autocorrelation analysis separately to the ask and bid limit order price change
sequences. Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary material present the average G-test statistics for
ask and bid sequences respectively, calculated across all trading days for each market capitalization tier and time-interval combination. The results demonstrate consistently high G-statistics with
p-values well below the 0.05 significance threshold ( _p_ ≪ 0.05) across all capitalization tiers and
time-intervals. These findings provide strong statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis of
independence, confirming that price changes depend significantly on preceding adjustments. This
is corroborated by the autocorrelation analysis, which reveals statistically significant correlations
√
at lags 1 and 2, with magnitudes exceeding the 1/ _N_ significance threshold (where _N_ represents

the total number of price change events) [51]. Although modest, these correlations decay systematically, indicating the presence of short-term memory effects consistent with first-order Markov
properties [52].
The convergent evidence from both G-test and autocorrelation analyses validates our approach
using first-order discrete-time Markov chains. While higher-order dependencies may exist, the
predominant lag-1 correlations justify the first-order assumption, which offers computational tractability while capturing the essential temporal dependencies in limit order price adjustment behaviors.
Consequently, we proceed with Maximum Likelihood Estimation of first-order transition probability matrices and systematic comparisons of dominant elements temporally and cross-sectionally
across the capitalization tiers as detailed in the following subsection. We restrict our analysis to
only D, E, and F price changes as the count of price changes for A, B, C, G, H and I are very low,
as shown in Fig.S1 in the supplementary material.


_4.2. Transition Probability Matrix Analysis_

We analyze limit order price changes using a discrete-time Markov chain, with a nine state
space defined by the price change magnitudes, as shown in Table 4. The transition probability
matrices (TPMs) for this chain are estimated via Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The analysis
encompasses both bid and ask limit orders across six intraday time-intervals for each of the three
market capitalization tiers – `HMC`, `MMC`, and `LMC` over twelve trading days. This generates 2,160
individual 9 × 9 TPMs, which we aggregate to produce 36 representative matrices: 18 for ask-side
changes and 18 for bid-side changes, with six matrices per capitalization tier corresponding to the
six time-intervals. Fig. 1 presents representative heatmap visualizations of the ask and bid transition probability matrices (TPMs) for the opening interval `T1` . In these matrices, rows correspond to
the current price change state and columns to the subsequent state, with cell values indicating transition probabilities. For a comprehensive analysis, the complete set of ask-side TPMs across all
capitalization tiers ( `HMC`, `MMC`, `LMC` ) and time intervals ( `T1` - `T6` ) is provided in Supplementary Figures S2 and S3. The corresponding complete set of bid-side TPMs is available in Supplementary
Figures S4 and S5.

tiers.


_4.2.1. Inertia of Limit Order Prices_
Figure 2 illustrates the temporal variation in the probability of consecutive 0% limit order price
changes i.e. price inertia, on both the bid and ask sides. This metric, which captures the likelihood
of limit orders maintaining an identical price across successive submissions, shows systematic
variations across different time-intervals and market capitalization tiers. The analysis reveals two
key empirical findings: Point 1 identifies a shared intraday dynamic common to the `HMC`, `MMC`, and
`LMC`, while Point 2 highlights the distinct characteristics for each capitalization tier.

Figure 2: Temporal variation of transition probability for consecutive 0% limit order price changes across market
capitalization tiers and time intervals.


1. Intraday limit order price change transition dynamics: We observed a consistent temporal pattern in the transition probability for consecutive 0% price changes across all market
capitalization tiers for both bid and ask sides, as summarized below:


(a) Price inertia peaks at market opening `T1` indicating a strong tendency for limit orders
to be submitted consecutively at the same price. This behavior likely reflects defensive
positioning at anticipated support and resistance levels. Heightened opening volatility,
driven by the assimilation of overnight news and information asymmetries, creates
uncertainty that encourages defensive positioning outside the spread and concentration
of orders at specific price points to avoid adverse selection costs [53, 54].


(b) The inertia probability declines sharply post-open and stabilizes at a lower level throughout the midday session i.e. `T2`       - `T5` . The initial decrease aligns with the dynamic price
discovery process, where high volatility and fluctuating bid-ask spreads necessitate
frequent limit order price adjustments, reducing the repetition of orders at the same
price. As the market absorbs new information, volatility subsides and spread narrows [55, 53]. This post-discovery environment fosters more heterogeneous trading
conditions where diverse participants employ mixed strategies, leading to dispersed
order placement and a stable, lower probability of consecutive submissions at identical
prices.


(c) Finally, the inertia surges during the closing hour `T6`, often exceeding the opening peak.
This resurgence is driven by intense end-of-day portfolio rebalancing, as the urgency
to close positions and mitigate overnight risk prompts market participants to submit
orders at key price levels to ensure execution [56, 57]. This strategic shift prioritizes
order fulfillment over price optimization, leading to a pronounced reduction in price


13


adjustments and a corresponding peak in the probability of consecutive submissions at
the same price.


2. Differences in price change transition dynamics between `HMC`, `MMC`, and `LMC` stocks: Crosscapitalization analysis reveals systematic differences in these dynamics that persist across
all trading time intervals, reflecting the distinct characteristics of each market tier.


(a) A strong capitalization gradient is observed; `HMC` stocks exhibit the strongest price
inertia, followed by `MMC` and then `LMC` stocks. This hierarchy reflects fundamental differences in their market structure. Greater liquidity and trading volume in `HMC` stocks
attract sophisticated participants, including market makers and high-frequency traders.
These agents provide continuous liquidity by maintaining persistent limit orders at
specific prices, resulting in a relatively high self-transition probabilities i.e. higher inertia. Conversely, `LMC` stocks exhibit the lowest probability of consecutive unchanged
prices. Lower liquidity, relatively higher transaction costs, and greater information
asymmetries discourage passive order placement. This necessitates dynamic order
management, where participants frequently adjust prices to mitigate risk, resulting in
systematically lower inertia.


(b) A bid-ask asymmetry gradient is evident, scaling from minimal in `HMC` stocks to maximal in `LMC` stocks. For `LMC` stocks, ask-side transition probabilities consistently exceed
bid-side probabilities across all intervals. This pattern is likely driven by three factors
specific to illiquid stocks: market makers maintain persistent ask limit orders to manage inventory risk [58], greater information asymmetry increases adverse selection
costs on the bid side [59], and institutional frictions like short-selling costs disproportionately hinder bid-side liquidity provision [60]. Collectively, these factors heighten
the observed price inertia of ask-side limit orders.


In summary, these findings demonstrate that limit order price change inertia is not random but
follows predictable U-shaped intraday patterns and a distinct capitalization gradient. The results
show that high-capitalization stocks exhibit the greatest price stability due to deep, continuous
liquidity, whereas low-capitalization stocks are characterized by lower overall stability and significant bid-ask asymmetries. For traders, this implies that execution strategies can be optimized by
anticipating higher price persistence during the market opening and closing hours, particularly in
`HMC` stocks, while accounting for both the lower stability and the dominant ask-side inertia inherent
to `LMC` stocks.


_4.2.2. Directional Momentum of Limit Order Price Revisions_
Figure 3 illustrates transition probabilities from neutral i.e. 0% price change, to both negative
and positive price changes across market capitalization tiers and intraday intervals. We point out
two key empirical findings from this analysis: Point 1 examines the systematic capitalizationbased hierarchy in price revision intensity, while Point 2 analyzes subtle bid-ask asymmetries in
directional transition behaviors.

(b) 0% price change to both negative price change.



Figure 3: Transition probabilities from neutral i.e. 0% price change, to both negative and positive price changes across
market capitalization tiers and intraday intervals.


1. Hierarchy in Revision Intensity: Cross analysis reveals a systematic ordering in directional
transition probabilities that persist across all trading time intervals and capitalization tiers,
that reflects the distinct characteristics, as elaborated below.


(a) Temporally, the intraday evolution patterns reveal distinctive opening hour dynamics
where `HMC` and `MMC` stocks show significant increases in directional transitions: 4.0%–
5.0% for defensive positioning, and 1.0%–1.5% for aggressive positioning, while `LMC`
stocks exhibit contrarian behavior with slight decreases. This divergence suggests differential responses to opening volatility and information asymmetries, with `LMC` traders
adopting more conservative adjustment strategies during high-uncertainty hours [53,
55].


(b) In terms of capitalization asymmetry, we observed that `LMC` stocks exhibit the highest
directional transition probabilities, demonstrating elevated limit order price revision
frequencies. The elevated revision frequency in `LMC` stocks stems from their market
microstructure: wider bid-ask spreads, higher volatility, limited liquidity, and reduced
market maker presence. These conditions create larger gaps between optimal execution prices and current market levels, necessitating more frequent price adjustments
to maintain execution viability [61]. On the other hand, `HMC` stocks exhibit the lowest revision frequencies, reflecting their stable market environment characterized by
narrower spreads, higher liquidity, and greater institutional presence. The enhanced
market maker activity maintains stable pricing conditions, creating extended periods
of order competitiveness that reduce revision incentives [62].


2. Subtle Bid-Ask Asymmetries in Directional Revisions: We identify two subtle but persistent
bid-ask asymmetries, formalized as:


15


_P_ (Bid : Neutral → Negative) ≳ _P_ (Ask : Neutral → Negative)

_P_ (Ask : Neutral → Positive) ≳ _P_ (Bid : Neutral → Positive)


where ≳ denotes a modest but persistent difference. This pattern reflect nuanced differences
in trading behaviors:


(a) The first inequality reflects a stronger value-seeking motive among buyers, who are
more prone to lowering their bids to improve entry prices.


(b) The second inequality reveals a stronger profit-maximizing motive among sellers, who
are more prone to raising their asks to capture better execution.


These empirical findings provide guidance for optimizing order management for traders while
navigating different market capitalization segments. The dominant capitalization hierarchy implies
that static, patient order placement is a viable strategy in `HMC` stocks, whereas the high revision
frequency in `LMC` stocks necessitates dynamic, adaptive strategies to manage execution risk. This
contrast is sharpest at the market open, where `LMC` traders turn conservative, while `HMC` traders
actively reposition. The subtle, persistent bid-ask asymmetries can be used to fine-tune priceshading logic, accounting for the slight but predictable value-seeking (bid) and profit-maximizing
(ask) tendencies of other participants.


_4.3. Markov Chain Metrics_

We now compute key Markov chain metrics. While the analysis of individual transition probabilities characterize local, state-to-state transitions, these metrics quantify the global dynamic
properties of the price change process.


_4.3.1. Spectral Gap, Relaxation and Mixing_
The spectral gap γ is analyzed to measure the convergence speed to equilibrium, which serves
as a proxy for price discovery efficiency. This metric exhibits a clear intraday pattern inverted
relative to volatility. As shown in Table 5, the gap is smallest at the market open ( `T1` ; γ ≈ 0.56–
0.60), indicating the slowest convergence during high-information assimilation. It peaks midday
( `T3` - `T4` ; γ ≈ 0.71–0.74), reflecting the fastest convergence, before declining slightly at the close
( `T6` ; γ ≈ 0.65–0.69). In terms of capitalization, `HMC` and `MMC` stocks exhibit slightly larger spectral
gaps than `LMC` stocks during active trading ( `T2` - `T5` ), consistent with more efficient price discovery
in higher-liquidity assets. Further, bid-ask differences in γ are modest (≲ 0.05) and secondary to
the primary temporal and capitalization patterns.
For completeness, we also report complementary measures: Mixing rate, λ⋆ = 1 − γ and the
relaxation time, τ = 1/γ in Table 5. As the relaxation rate is defined as κ ≡ 1/τ = γ, κ is
numerically identical to the spectral gap, while λ⋆ is a linear reparameterization. Accordingly,
these metrics are all complementary: a high mixing rate corresponds to a long relaxation time and
a small spectral gap, indicating slow convergence. We include these for readers who prefer those
conventions rather than as distinct metrics.

_4.3.2. Entropy Rate_
The entropy rate is analyzed to quantify the unpredictability of the price change sequence. As
seen from Table 5, there is a clear capitalization hierarchy. `LMC` stocks consistently exhibit the
highest entropy rates, followed by `MMC`, and `HMC` . This gradient confirms that price change dynamics are least predictable in `LMC` stocks and most structured in `HMC` stocks, reflecting underlying
differences in market depth and information asymmetry. Temporally, entropy rates are highest
at `T1` and generally decline toward `T6`, suggesting a shift from information-heavy assimilation to
more orderly, execution-driven trading. Further, bid-side entropy rates are marginally higher than
ask-side, indicating slightly greater unpredictability in buy-side pricing, though this effect remains
secondary.


_4.3.3. Mean Recurrence Time_
Finally, we analyze the mean recurrence times (MRT), which measures the average number of
steps required for the process to return to a given state. As shown in Table 6, the MRTs clearly
distinguish between neutral, mild, and extreme limit-order price change states across intraday
intervals, market-capitalization tiers, and order side. The intraday dynamics show opposing trends
at the market close: neutral-state _S_ 5 MRTs compress, for example `HMC` shortens from 2.3 to 2.0
steps, due to execution urgency, while mild-states _S_ 4 and _S_ 6 MRTs lengthen, for example `HMC`
from 3.7 to 4.1 steps, as price fine-tuning subsides. Extreme states are most frequent, having the
shortest MRT, at the open `T1`, aligning with high initial volatility, a pattern most pronounced in
`LMC` stocks, such as the Ask state _S_ 1 MRT of 224.4.
Neutral changes, represented by state _S_ 5, recur most frequently with a capitalization hierarchy:


17


`HMC` : 2.0–2.4 steps, `MMC` : 2.4–3.2, and `LMC` : 2.8–3.6. This pattern reflects more stable order
maintenance in liquid stocks, whereas thinner `LMC` order books require more frequent non-neutral
revisions. Mild adjustments, i.e. states _S_ 4 and _S_ 6, show an inverted pattern, occurring most
often in `LMC` stocks at 2.9–3.2 steps, consistent with continuous fine-tuning under wider spreads.
Moderate states i.e. _S_ 3 and _S_ 7 lie between these benchmarks. Extreme states _S_ 1, _S_ 2, _S_ 8, and _S_ 9 are
rare, with mean recurrence measured in hundreds of steps, in all the cases. Further, a pronounced
bid-ask asymmetry appears, primarily in `LMC` extremes. For example, at `T2`, an extreme negative
revision i.e. state _S_ 1 recurs in 329.5 steps on the ask side versus 1051.3 steps on the bid side. This
is consistent with traders posting less aggressive bid-side limit orders to avoid accumulating long
inventory in illiquid stocks.
In summary, these Markov chain metrics quantify the global dynamics of limit order price
change process, confirming a clear capitalization hierarchy. `HMC` stocks are characterized by efficient price discovery with high γ, relatively higher predictability from low _H_, and stable persistence from low _S_ 5 MRT, supporting patient, queue-joining trading strategies. Conversely, `LMC`
stocks show a turbulent, less efficient regime with lower γ and higher _H_, and a rapid recurrence of
mild adjustments, evident from low _S_ 4 and _S_ 6 MRT, which necessitates dynamic, price-adaptive
order management. The extreme bid-side scarcity in `LMC` further warrants more conservative bidding, while the universal compression of neutral-state recurrence times at market close requires
intensified monitoring across all tiers as execution urgency increases.


_4.4. Clustering Analysis of Transition Dynamics_

We now examine the collective similarity of transition probability matrices (TPMs) through
clustering. This examination identifies natural groupings in limit order price change behaviors
across time intervals and market capitalization tiers. Each 9 × 9 TPM is flattened into an 81dimensional vector, yielding 18 vectors per side i.e., 6 intervals × 3 tiers. We then reduce the
dimensionality of the TPMs using principal component analysis (PCA) where only 9 components
are retain, followed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for 2D visualization
as shown in Fig. 4a and 4b, for ask and bid sides, respectively. We then apply hierarchical agglomerative clustering and DBSCAN to these embeddings.
Hierarchical clustering reveals significant ask-bid side differences in temporal structure, as
shown in Figs. 5a and 5b. The bid side exhibits greater heterogeneity, with linkage distances
ranging 0 − 700 versus 0 − 400 on the ask side. Despite this, the bid side shows clear temporal
segmentation. Opening `T1` and closing `T6` hours form distinct clusters. Midday trading hours i.e.,
`T2` - `T5` consolidates into a single cluster. In contrast, the ask side displays more complex temporal
dynamics. Midday intervals ( `T2` - `T4` ) show extensive interleaving. The pre-closing hour i.e. `T5`
separates from midday to cluster with the closing hour `T6` . This suggests that sellers initiate endof-day positioning strategies earlier than the formal closing hour.
DBSCAN analysis reinforces this key temporal asymmetry. The bid side produces three wellseparated, dense clusters corresponding to the traditional trading sessions: Opening `T1`, Midday
from `T2` to `T5`, and Closing `T6` . In contrast, the ask side yields four distinct clusters: Opening `T1`,
Midday from `T2` to `T4`, and two separate end-of-day clusters: Pre-Close `T5` and Close `T6` . The
clear separation of `T5` on the ask side provides data-driven evidence that sellers begin strategic
preparations for the closing open positions significantly earlier than buyers.

yields clearer Opening/Midday/Closing islands; Ask’s tighter layout produces more mid-interval blending unless ε is
reduced.


In summary, these clustering patterns reveal that market dynamics are primarily driven by timeof-day and order side, with market capitalization playing a secondary role. A key finding is the
greater heterogeneity of the bid side, which nonetheless organizes into a clear, three-regime structure: Opening `T1`, Midday `T2` - `T5`, and Closing `T6`, that supports structured execution algorithms
with predictable transition points. Conversely, the ask side, while more homogeneous, displays a
more complex, four-regime structure defined by the early emergence of a `T5` pre-closing dynamic,
implying sellers begin position unwinding earlier. For traders, this necessitates asymmetric timing: bid-side logic can follow the standard intraday pattern, while ask-side logic must anticipate
this early shift to closing dynamics.

(b) Bid-side dendrogram

(≈ 0–≈ 400), indicating greater heterogeneity on Bid. In both trees, _T_ 1, _T_ 5, _T_ 6 appear as tight triplets. Ask shows
heavier interleaving among _T_ 2, _T_ 3, _T_ 4; Bid forms cleaner adjacent sub-blocks for _T_ 2 and _T_ 3, with _T_ 4 bridging.


_4.5. Stationary distribution of limit-order price changes_

Having identified distinct temporal regimes through clustering, we now examine the stationary
distribution π to characterize the long-term equilibrium behavior of limit order price change states.
This distribution, representing the equilibrium state probabilities, reveals the predominant price
change tendencies and is reported in Tables S3 and S4 of the Supplementary Material. Across all
configurations, the distribution is heavily concentrated with over 97% probability in three states:
mild negative change π4, zero change π5, and mild positive change π6. A consistent capitalization
gradient emerges – moving from `HMC` to `LMC`, π5 declines substantially while π4 and π6 increase.
This confirms that lower-capitalization stocks exhibit less price inertia and require more frequent
small revisions. Furthermore, the probabilities of mild upward and downward changes remain
nearly symmetric, with π4 ≈ π6 within each tier.

on left and **Bid** on right.


To quantify the dissimilarity between these stationary distributions across different time intervals, we compute the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), as visualized in the heatmaps in Figs. 7–


20


9. The JSD analysis reveals a robust temporal structure common to both ask and bid sides. The
closing hour `T6` consistently emerges as the most distinct, showing the largest divergences from
the midday block `T2` - `T5` across all tiers. This pronounced divergence signals a fundamental shift in
market participants’ objectives: as the trading session concludes, the primary incentive transitions
from value-seeking price discovery to deadline-driven inventory management. The urgency to
square positions and mitigate overnight risk forces a structural reconfiguration of limit order submission probabilities, creating a unique equilibrium state that differs significantly from the steady
liquidity provision characterizing the midday regime. A secondary distinct shift occurs immediately post-open, with `T2` diverging significantly from `T1`, likely driven by the resolution of initial
information asymmetry. In contrast, the midday period spanning `T2` to `T5` remains relatively stable,
characterized by low pairwise JSD values between adjacent midday intervals. Comparing sides,
the bid generally exhibits larger JSD values, particularly at the close and post-open, confirming
previous findings from clustering and metrics that bid-side behavior varies more and changes more
significantly between periods, while the ask side is more consistently stable during midday.













Figure 8: Jensen–Shannon Divergence between π _s_ of different time intervals for `MMC` limit order price changes: **Ask**
on left and **Bid** on right.


Market capitalization further modulates the temporal divergences. `HMC` stocks exhibit the
smallest overall JSD differences with `T6` departures in the range of 0.040–0.049 on ask and 0.042–0.056
on bid. `T2` - `T1` breaks measure approximately 0.02–0.03, reflecting greater stability across trading
phases. Whereas, `MMC` stocks demonstrate the most pronounced closing differentiation. This pattern is particularly strong on the ask side where `T6` versus `T2` reaches 0.085. Bid-side `T6` gaps also
remain elevated. Finally, `LMC` stocks feature sharp post-open adjustments. The bid-side `T2` versus `T1` divergence equals 0.0437. Closing-hour divergences are substantial though remain below
`MMC` peaks. These systematic variations confirm that intraday phase remains the primary organizing force, while capitalization modulates both the intensity of temporal contrasts and the degree
of ask–bid asymmetry. These findings necessitate capitalization-aware parameterization: tighter
monitoring thresholds for `LMC` stocks during the post-open period i.e. between `T1` & `T2`, and the
lead-up to the close i.e. between `T5` & `T6`, and more conservative bid-side risk management during
phase shifts across all tiers.
In summary, the stationary distribution analysis confirms that limit order dynamics are predominantly characterized by neutral and mild price changes, with the lower probability of neu

tral states in `LMC` stocks underscoring their need for more frequent revisions. The JSD analysis
provides strong quantitative evidence for the three distinct intraday phases—Open, Midday, and
Close—previously identified via clustering. Crucially, it demonstrates that market capitalization
systematically modulates the intensity of divergences between these phases, with `HMC` stocks showing the greatest stability and `LMC` exhibiting amplified shifts, especially post-open. These findings
collectively reinforce the necessity of phase-aware and capitalization-aware trading strategies.
Furthermore, the consistently higher JSD values on the bid side confirm its greater heterogeneity, warranting tighter risk controls for buy-side liquidity provision during these critical phase
transitions.
To provide a holistic overview before concluding in Section 6, we present the overall study
workflow in Fig. 10 alongside a structured summary of the key empirical findings from Section 4.

While this study provides evidence on intraday limit order price change transitions, we recognize that the empirical findings can be sensitive to modeling and sampling choices. Our analysis
focuses on NASDAQ100 stocks during a twelve-day period, employs first-order Markov chains for
modeling state transitions, and divides the trading day into six unequal-duration intervals. Each
of these choices, while empirically motivated, represents one among several plausible approaches.
Accordingly, we explicitly assess whether the main conclusions are stable under alternative specifications, so that the documented patterns are not driven by arbitrary design decisions.
To ensure our findings reflect genuine market patterns rather than methodological artifacts, we
conducted four comprehensive robustness analyses that assess the sensitivity of our conclusions.
Detailed methodologies and complete results are provided in Supplementary Material Section S3.
For clarity, we summarize here the objective and outcome of each test, emphasizing the practical
(rather than purely statistical) magnitude of deviations. First, we validated the time-homogeneity
assumption by subdividing each interval into four sub-periods. While formal likelihood ratio tests
detected minor fluctuations (as expected under large sample sizes), mean absolute differences remained well below the 10% statistical threshold, confirming practical stability of transition probabilities within intervals. This supports the interpretation of each intraday segment as approximately stationary in transition dynamics. Second, we evaluated our first-order Markov specification against a second-order alternative. Although the latter was statistically favored, conditional
mutual information was negligible, out-of-sample predictive gains were minimal, and the secondorder specification required nearly four times as many parameters, supporting our parsimonious
first-order choice. In other words, higher-order dependence exists statistically but contributes little
incremental explanatory or predictive content relative to the complexity it introduces in a regimecomparison setting. Third, we assessed sensitivity to interval duration by comparing pooled onehour versus two-hour aggregations. he resulting transition probability matrices were numerically


24


indistinguishable at the level relevant for the metric, clustering, and divergence analyses. Fourth,
we examined our unequal-duration interval specification against uniform 65-minute segmentation.
The transition probabilities showed low mean absolute differences, with no statistically significant
differences after multiple testing correction. Taken together, these exercises indicate that the main
intraday patterns—including the capitalization gradient, the temporal clustering structure, and the
bid–ask asymmetries—are not artifacts of interval design. Overall, the robustness checks support
the conclusion that the documented transition dynamics reflect stable features of the underlying
order submission and revision process within the scope of our dataset.
Beyond statistical validity, the results also carry direct practical implications for market participants. For execution algorithms, the distinct capitalization gradient we document suggests that
static, patient execution logic is well suited for `HMC` stocks, where price adjustments are infrequent
and stable, whereas `LMC` stocks require more dynamic, price-adaptive strategies to accommodate
higher revision intensities. With respect to intraday regime detection, our clustering results show
that market phases are better characterized by behavioral shifts such as the early onset of ask-side
closing dynamics, rather than by fixed clock-based partitions, offering a data-driven approach to
regime switching. Finally, liquidity provision strategies can be improved by incorporating the
documented bid–ask asymmetries – in particular, market makers may tighten risk controls on the
bid side for `LMC` stocks, where extreme negative revisions are structurally less frequent, thereby
enabling more efficient inventory and spread management. The stability of the transition dynamics across alternative temporal aggregations, interval specifications, and Markov orders suggests
that the behaviors documented in this study are robust within modern electronic limit order book
trading.
While our methodological choices are validated within the current scope, several extensions
remain valuable. Applying the framework to other markets, asset classes, and longer time horizons would enable assessment of generalizability and detection of structural changes. In particular, extending the sample beyond a short window would clarify the extent to which the identified
regimes persist across volatility states, macro announcements, and market-wide liquidity conditions. Exploring non-Markovian specifications may capture additional dependence in sequential
price adjustments. For example, semi-Markov or variable-length specifications could directly account for state-dependent sojourn times and heterogeneous memory, potentially refining the characterization of intraday persistence. Finally, although our nine-state discretization captures key
dynamics, alternative state definitions or continuous-state approaches may reveal further nuances
in limit order price revisions. These may include state definitions anchored to tick-size constraints,
queue-position proxies, or spread-conditioned revisions, which could improve interpretability in
specific microstructure settings. These extensions would help generalize and deepen the insights
developed in this study.


**6. Conclusion**


This study provides the first systematic examination of intraday limit order price change transition dynamics, addressing a critical gap in market microstructure research by analyzing ask and bid
orders separately across High ( `HMC` ), Medium ( `MMC` ), and Low ( `LMC` ) market capitalization stocks.
By employing a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) framework on high-frequency tick-by-tick


25


NASDAQ-100 data, we have uncovered fundamental patterns that govern how traders adjust limit
order prices throughout the trading day, revealing complex interactions between temporal dynamics, market capitalization, and order side.
Time-interval wise comparison of transition probability matrices reveals systematic intraday
patterns in price change inertia. The probability of consecutive zero price changes exhibits a distinct temporal structure: peaking at market opening due to defensive positioning, declining and
stabilizing during midday as price discovery progresses, and surging again at the close—often
exceeding the opening peak—driven by execution urgency. A pronounced capitalization gradient
emerges in these dynamics. `HMC` stocks exhibit the strongest price inertia reflecting deep liquidity,
while `LMC` stocks demonstrate lower stability and pronounced bid-ask asymmetries. In extreme
price change states, ask-side transition probabilities consistently exceed bid-side probabilities in
`LMC` stocks, with extreme negative bid-side revisions recurring less frequently. Markov chain metrics quantify the global dynamic properties of these processes. The spectral gap, smallest at market
open and peaking midday, indicates that `HMC` and `MMC` stocks converge faster to equilibrium than
`LMC` stocks. The entropy rate reveals a clear capitalization hierarchy, with `LMC` stocks exhibiting
the highest unpredictability. Mean recurrence times show that neutral changes recur most frequently in `HMC` stocks, while mild adjustments occur most often in `LMC` stocks. Extreme states are
rare across all configurations, with pronounced bid-ask asymmetry in `LMC` stocks. These findings
enable execution strategy optimization: patient approaches in high-capitalization stocks during
midday versus dynamic strategies in low-capitalization stocks during phase shifts.
Clustering analysis reveals distinct temporal regimes differing fundamentally between order
sides. The bid side organizes into three regimes—Opening, Midday, and Closing—while the ask
side exhibits four—Opening, Midday, Pre-Close, and Close—providing data-driven evidence that
sellers begin strategic positioning earlier than buyers. Stationary distributions show heavy concentration with over 97% probability in mild negative, zero, and mild positive change states. Zerochange probability declines substantially from `HMC` to `LMC` stocks, confirming more frequent small
revisions in lower-capitalization stocks. Jensen-Shannon divergence computed between stationary
distributions across time intervals reveals robust temporal structure. The closing hour emerges
as the most distinct phase with largest divergences from midday, while a secondary shift occurs
post-open. The bid side exhibits larger divergence values, confirming greater variability. Market
capitalization modulates these contrasts: `HMC` stocks show smallest differences reflecting stability,
MMC stocks demonstrate pronounced closing differentiation, and `LMC` stocks feature sharp postopen adjustments. These variations confirm intraday phase as the primary organizing force, with
capitalization modulating the intensity of temporal contrasts and the degree of bid-ask asymmetry.
The early emergence of ask-side closing dynamics necessitates asymmetric timing in algorithmic
strategies.
This paper demonstrates that limit order price change dynamics are neither random nor homogeneous but follow systematic patterns shaped by the interplay of intraday timing, market
capitalization, and order side. The DTMC framework proves effective in capturing both shortterm sequential dependencies through transition probabilities and long-term equilibrium behaviors
through stationary distributions. By revealing the fundamental asymmetries between ask and bid
orders and quantifying how these dynamics vary across liquidity regimes, this research advances
understanding of modern equity markets and provides a foundation for developing context-aware


26


trading strategies. Future research could extend this framework by incorporating order book depth
and liquidity measures to analyze how price changes interact with available liquidity at different
price levels, and by examining the impact of specific news events or macroeconomic releases on
transition dynamics to illuminate how information shocks propagate through limit order pricing
behavior. As electronic trading continues to dominate financial markets, the insights from this
study become increasingly relevant for all market participants seeking to navigate the complex,
high-frequency environment of contemporary limit order books.

# **Supplementary Material: Intraday Limit** **Order Price Change Transition Dynamics** **Across Market Capitalizations Through** **Markov Analysis**

This document provides the supplementary material associated with the main article _Intraday Limit Order_
_Price Change Transition Dynamics Across Market Capitalizations Through Markov Analysis_ . The content is
organized as follows, presented in the order referenced in the main manuscript.


**Section S1. G-Test**
S1 presents supplementary Tables S1 and S2. These tables report the G-statistics and _p_ -values that assess the
Markov property by testing and rejecting the null hypothesis of independence between price change states.
The average count of limit order price change categories are also presented in Fig. S1.


**Section S2. Transition Probability Matrices**
S2 contains supplementary Figures S2–S5. These figures display the complete set of transition probability
matrices for both the ask and bid sides, across all market capitalization tiers and intraday time intervals.


**Section S3. Stationary Distribution of Price Change States**
S3 provides Tables S3 and S4. These tables present the estimated stationary distributions for all market
capitalization tiers, for both ask and bid sides, and for each intraday time interval.


**Section S4. Robustness Analyses**
S4 details the robustness analyses conducted to validate the study’s methodology and findings. This section is
further divided into two subsections:

 - **S4(a) Methodologies.** This subsection provides the formal mathematical descriptions for all robustness
and sensitivity checks, including tests for time-homogeneity, comparisons of first- and second-order
Markov models, and alternative interval segmentation schemes.

 - **S4(b) Results.** This subsection reports the findings of the robustness and sensitivity analyses, including
interpretation of how these results support the main empirical findings.


**S1. G-TEST**

Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 report the average G-statistics and corresponding p-values for each stock
in the `HMC`, `MMC` and `LMC` tiers across all intraday time-intervals, where the averages are computed over 12
trading days. In both tables, G-statistics remain high and all p-values satisfy _p_ 0.05, confirming that the
_≪_
null hypothesis of independence is decisively rejected for every scenario. These results imply that each limit
order price change depends significantly on the preceding change, indicating clear temporal dependence in
the sequences. Consequently, the application of the Markov property to analyze the limit order price change
dynamics is strongly validated.

**S4. ROBUSTNESS ANALYSES**

**S4 (a). Robustness Analyses Methodologies**
This subsection presents detailed methodologies for robustness analyses to validate the main findings of our
study on intraday limit order price change transitions. We perform four key robustness checks: (a1) comparison
with second-order Markov chains, (a2) time-homogeneity validation within intervals, (a3) sensitivity to interval
duration, and (a4) sensitivity to equal versus unequal interval segmentation, as given below.

_**S4 (a1). Comparison with Second-Order Markov Chains**_
While we employ first-order Markov chains based on statistical validation via G-test and autocorrelation
analysis, it is important to assess whether second-order dependencies provide substantial improvements in
model fit and predictive performance. This analysis justifies the parsimony of the first-order assumption.
With state space 1, _. . ._, 9 and sequence ( _Xt_ ) _[T]_ _t_ =1 [, the two Markov orders are defined as:]
_{_ _}_

First-order: _P_ ( _Xt_ = _j | Xt−_ 1 = _i_ ) = _pij_ [(][1][)][,] (S1)

Second-order: _P_ ( _Xt_ = _k | Xt−_ 1 = _j_, _Xt−_ 2 = _i_ ) = _pijk_ [(][2][)] [.] (S2)

For maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), we define the following transition and history counts:



_cij_ =


_cijk_ =




- _T_

**I** _{Xt−_ 1 = _i_, _Xt_ = _j}_, (S3)
_t_ =2

- _T_

**I** _{Xt−_ 2 = _i_, _Xt−_ 1 = _j_, _Xt_ = _k}_, (S4)
_t_ =3

and the row totals are defined by _ci·_ = [�]



_j_ _[c][ij]_ [ and] _[ c][ij][·]_ [ =][ �]



_k_ _[c][ijk]_ [. The MLEs are]



_p_ ˆ _ij_ [(][1][)] [=] _[c][ij]_

with the usual convention that terms with _cij_ = 0 or _cijk_ = 0 contribute zero.
We compute Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model
comparison [1], [2], [3]:



AIC1 = 2 _k_ 1 _−_ 2 _ℓ_ 1, AIC2 = 2 _k_ 2 _−_ 2 _ℓ_ 2, (S9)

BIC1 = _k_ 1 log( _N_ ) 2 _ℓ_ 1, BIC2 = _k_ 2 log( _N_ ) 2 _ℓ_ 2, (S10)

where 1 and 2 are the sets of origin states (or state pairs) with non-zero transitions, and _mi_ [(][1][)], _mij_ [(][2][)] are the
_I_ _I_
numbers of destination states with positive counts.
The likelihood ratio test statistic for comparing nested models is [4], [5]:

_G_ [2] = 2( _ℓ_ 2 _ℓ_ 1) _χ_ [2] df [,] df = _k_ 2 _k_ 1. (S13)
_−_ _∼_ _−_

**Information-theoretic measures:** The conditional mutual information quantifies the additional information provided by _Xt_ 2 about _Xt_ given _Xt_ 1 [6]:

_−_ _−_

_I_ ( _Xt−_ 2; _Xt | Xt−_ 1) = _[ℓ]_ [2] _[ −]_ _N_ _[ℓ]_ [1], (S14)

expressed in nats per event. To convert to bits per event:


_I_
_I_ bits = ~~log 2~~ [.] (S15)

**Mathematical equivalence tests:** A key property is that the first-order transition probabilities should
equal the marginal of the second-order probabilities [7], [8]. We verify:

**Out-of-sample validation:** To assess predictive performance, we split each sequence into training (first
80%) and testing (last 20%) subsets. We employ Dirichlet smoothing with hyperparameter _α_ to handle zero
counts [9]:


_cij_ + _α_

log _p_ ˜ _X_ [(][1] _t_ [)] _−_ 1, _Xt_
_t∈_ test 



, (S21)








, (S22)







where _N_ test is the number of test-set transitions used for each model. The difference ∆ _ℓ_ [test] = _ℓ_ [test] 2 _−_ _ℓ_ [test] 1
quantifies the predictive improvement of the second-order model. We report the mean, minimum, and maximum
across multiple smoothing parameters _α_ 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 .
_∈{_ _}_
The first-order assumption ( _M_ 1) is justified by a convergence of evidence, prioritizing parsimony and
practical performance. _M_ 1 is validated if: (1) information criteria, particularly the more stringent BIC1, favor
it (BIC1 _<_ BIC2); (2) the Conditional Mutual Information ( **CMI** ) is practically zero (e.g., _<_ 0.01 bits/event),
confirming _Xt_ 2 adds negligible information; (3) the marginal maximum absolute difference check (∆max) is

_−_
near machine-zero, confirming both models capture identical one-step dynamics; and (4) the out-of-sample
(OOS) predictive gain (mean _α_ OOS ∆ _ℓ_ [test] ) is negligible or negative. A statistically significant _G_ [2] ( _p <_ 0.05) is
expected with large datasets [5] and does not invalidate _M_ 1 if these practical, complexity-penalized, and OOS
metrics support it [3], [10].

_**S4 (a2). Time-Homogeneity**_
The discrete-time Markov chain framework assumes time-homogeneity within each intraday time interval,
meaning that transition probabilities remain constant throughout the interval. This assumption is critical
for valid inference. We test this assumption by dividing each interval into sub-intervals and comparing the
resulting transition probability matrices.
For each trading interval _τ ∈{_ `T1`, `T2`, _. . ._, `T6` _}_ and market capitalization tier _c ∈{_ `HMC`, `MMC`, `LMC` _}_, we load
the sequence of price change states _Xt_ _t_ =1 [where] _[ X][t][ ∈{]_ [1, 2,] _[ . . .]_ [, 9] _[}]_ [ represents the discretized price change]
_{_ _}_ _[T]_
category at time _t_ . Each sequence is partitioned into _K_ sub-intervals of approximately equal length using the
following procedure:
Sub-interval _k_ : _{Xt}t_ _[u]_ = _[k]_ _ℓk_ [,] _k_ = 1, 2, _. . ._, _K_, (S23)



where _ℓk_ and _uk_ denote the lower and upper indices of sub-interval _k_, determined by:




  ( _k_ 1) _T_
_ℓk_ = _−_




- _kT_
+ 1, _uk_ =



_K_



_K_




. (S24)



We use _K_ = 4 sub-intervals as the default specification, ensuring each sub-interval contains sufficient
transitions for stable estimation while providing adequate temporal resolution. For each sub-interval _k_, we
construct the transition count matrix **C** [(] _[k]_ [)] = [ _cij_ [(] _[k]_ [)][]][ where]



_cij_ [(] _[k]_ [)] [=]



_u_ - _k−_ 1

**I** _{Xt_ = _i_, _Xt_ +1 = _j}_ . (S25)
_t_ = _ℓk_



The corresponding transition probability matrix is obtained via row normalization:



_cij_ [(] _[k]_ [)]
_pij_ [(] _[k]_ [)] [=] ~~�9~~, if
_j_ _[′]_ =1 _[c]_ _ij_ [(] _[k][′]_ [)]


11



�9

_cij_ [(] _[k][′]_ [)] _[ >]_ [ 0,] (S26)
_j_ _[′]_ =1


and the pooled transition probability matrix across all sub-intervals is computed as:




 - _K_ _c_ [pool] _ij_

**C** [pool] = **C** [(] _[k]_ [)], _p_ [pool] _ij_ = ~~�9~~ . (S27)

_k_ =1 _j_ _[′]_ =1 _[c]_ _ij_ ~~[pool]~~ _[′]_



**Mean Absolute Difference Metric:** We quantify practical homogeneity using the mean absolute difference
(MAD) of transition probabilities across all pairs of sub-intervals:




- _K_


_k_ _[′]_ = _k_ +1



�9

( _k_ )
��� _pij_ _ij_ ��� . (S28)

A threshold of MAD _<_ 0.10 is used to support practical time-homogeneity, following established guidelines for
transition probability stability [11].
**Likelihood Ratio Test:** We perform a formal likelihood ratio test for homogeneity of transition matrices
across sub-intervals. The test statistic is [12], [13]:

where the expected count under the homogeneity hypothesis is:


_Eij_ [(] _[k]_ [)] = _ni_ [(] _[k]_ [)] _p_ [pool] _ij_, _ni_ [(] _[k]_ [)] =


The degrees of freedom are computed as:



�9

_cij_ [(] _[k]_ [)][.] (S30)
_j_ =1




 df =



( _K_ 1)( _mi_ 1), (S31)
_−_ _−_
_i∈I_



where = _i_ : [�][9] _j_ =1 _[c]_ _ij_ [pool] _>_ 0 is the set of origin states with non-zero transitions in the pooled data, and
_I_ _{_ _}_



_mi_ = _j_ : _c_ [pool] _ij_ _>_ 0 is the number of destination states with positive pooled counts for origin state _i_ .
_|{_ _}|_



Under the null hypothesis of time-homogeneity, _G_ _χ_ [2] df [. The] _[ p]_ [-value is computed as:]
_∼_



_p_ = _P_ ( _χ_ [2] df _χ_ [2] df [(] _[G]_ [)][.] (S32)

_[≥]_ _[G]_ [) =][ 1] _[ −]_ _[F]_



For each ( _τ_, _c_ ) we apply the following decision rules: (i) if MAD _<_ 0.10, the interval is considered practically
time-homogeneous; (ii) the LRT _p_ -value is reported for completeness but, given large-sample sensitivity [14],

[15], it does not overturn the practical-homogeneity conclusion in (i) unless accompanied by MAD 0.10; (iii)
_≥_
rows with zero pooled transitions are excluded from _G_ and df, and expected counts use pooled row-wise MLEs.

_**S4 (a3). Sensitivity to Interval Duration**_
Our primary analysis uses six unequal-duration intervals based on established market microstructure patterns.
To assess robustness, we compare transition probability matrices estimated from pooled one-hour intervals
versus pooled two-hour intervals formed by concatenating consecutive one-hour sequences.
To compare the different aggregation durations, we define two distinct pooling methods:




- **One-Hour Pooling:** Estimate transition counts separately for each of the six one-hour files, then sum
across all files:



�6



**C** [(][1] _[h]_ [)] =



**C** [(] _[h]_ [)], **P** [(][1] _[h]_ [)] = RowNorm( **C** [(][1] _[h]_ [)] ). (S33)
_h_ =1




- **Two-Hour Pooling:** Concatenate consecutive hour pairs (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6) to form three two-hour
_{_ _}_
sequences, estimate counts for each, then sum:



�3

**C** [(][2] _[h]_ [)] = **C** [(] _[p]_ [)], **P** [(][2] _[h]_ [)] = RowNorm( **C** [(][2] _[h]_ [)] ). (S34)

_p_ =1

We quantify the similarity between **P** [(][1] _[h]_ [)] and **P** [(][2] _[h]_ [)] using:

When concatenating hour pairs, the total number of transitions increases by the number of cross-boundary
transitions. For a pair ( _h_, _h_ + 1) with sequences _Xt_ [(] _[h]_ [)] and _Xt_ [(] _[h]_ [+][1][)], concatenation adds exactly one
_{_ _}_ _{_ _}_

transition: ( _XT_ [(] _[h]_ _h_ [)][,] _[ X]_ 1 [(] _[h]_ [+][1][)] ). The expected increase in total transitions is:



∆ _N_ =

Our interpretation of the distance metrics is as follows [16], [17]: if _dF <_ 10 _[−]_ [4] and _d_ max _<_ 10 _[−]_ [4], the TPMs
are considered numerically indistinguishable. If _dF <_ 10 _[−]_ [3] and _d_ max _<_ 10 _[−]_ [3], they are considered extremely
similar and the aggregation choice is immaterial. Otherwise, noticeable differences exist, and the sensitivity
should be reported.

_**S4 (a4). Sensitivity to Equal versus Unequal Interval Segmentation**_
Our baseline analysis utilizes six unequal-duration intervals specifically designed to capture distinct market
microstructure phases. To ensure our findings are not artifacts of this specific segmentation, we assess their
sensitivity by comparing them against a uniform grid of equal-duration intervals spanning the same trading
day.
To compare the different segmentation schemes, we define the following interval specifications:

 - **Unequal Intervals (Baseline):** Intervals are 60 minutes long, except for the midday periods `T3`
(11:30–12:45) and `T4` (12:45–14:00), which are extended to 75 minutes.

 - **Equal Intervals:** The trading day is strictly partitioned into six equal 65-minute intervals.

We focus our sensitivity analysis on three specific transitions from the neutral state (state 5): _p_ 5,5 (price
inertia), _p_ 5,4 (defensive positioning), and _p_ 5,6 (aggressive positioning). For each interval _i_ and focal transition
( _s_, _s_ _[′]_ ), we use the following statistical measures to compare ˆ _p_ [unequal,] _ss_ _[′]_ _[i]_ versus ˆ _p_ [equal,] _ss_ _[′]_ _[i]_ :
**Standard Errors (Binomial Approximation):**

Since this analysis involves 18 simultaneous comparisons (3 transitions 6 intervals), we apply the Benjamini_×_
Hochberg procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at _α_ = 0.05 [18].
Our interpretation of these sensitivity metrics is as follows [16], [17]: we deem the baseline results robust
if the mean absolute differences are small ( _<_ 0.01), few significant differences remain after FDR correction,
and effect sizes are negligible (mean _h_ _<_ 0.2). Substantial differences would indicate sensitivity to interval
_|_ _|_
definition, necessitating cautious interpretation of temporal patterns.

**S4 (b). Robustness Analyses Results**
The subsection presents the results of the robustness analyses that validates the findings of our study on limit
order price change transition dynamics.

_**S4 (b1). Comparison with Second-Order Markov Chains**_
We assessed whether incorporating second-order dependencies provides a substantial improvement over the
parsimonious first-order model. Tables S5 and S6 present representative results for Amazon (AMZN) on
November 7, 2018.
Consistent with the high-frequency nature of the data with large _N_ triples, formal in-sample statistical tests
heavily favor the more complex second-order model. The likelihood ratio test statistics ( _G_ [2] ) are all highly
significant ( _p <_ 0.001), and information criteria (AIC and BIC) generally confirm this statistical preference due
to the sheer volume of observations. However, multiple alternative metrics demonstrate that these statistically
significant gains are negligible in practice, justifying the sufficiency of the first-order assumption:

1. **Marginal Identity:** The maximum absolute difference (∆max) between the first-order MLE and the
marginalized second-order mixture is extremely small, typically _<_ 10 _[−]_ [3], and often _<_ 10 _[−]_ [4] . This confirms
that the one-step transition dynamics are effectively identical under both models.

2. **Information Gain:** The Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is very low, averaging approximately
0.057 bits per event for Ask and 0.056 bits per event for Bid sequences. This indicates that _Xt_ 2 provides

_−_
minimal additional predictive information once _Xt_ 1 is known.

_−_

3. **Predictive Performance:** The out-of-sample (OOS) log-likelihood gains (mean _α_ ∆ _ℓ_ [test] ) are minor,
averaging only 0.03 to 0.04 nats per event.
_≈_

4. **Complexity Cost:** The second-order model requires estimating approximately 4 times as many
parameters ( _k_ 2/ _k_ 1 _≈_ 3.8 to 4.0 on average), significantly increasing model complexity for marginal
predictive return.

This convergence of evidence—where formal statistical significance is driven by sample size rather than effect
size—was observed consistently across all 15 stocks and 12 trading days in our dataset. Therefore, we retain the
first-order Markov chain as the preferred model due to its parsimony and demonstrated practical sufficiency.

All _G_ [2] values are significant at _p <_ 0.001. OOS ∆ _ℓ_ is the mean across _α_ .


_**S4 (b2). Time-Homogeneity**_
We validated the assumption of time-homogeneity within each of the six intraday intervals `T1` - `T6` by subdividing
them into four smaller periods and comparing their transition structures. As a representative example, Tables
S7 and S8 present the results for Amazon (AMZN) on a single trading day (November 7, 2018). This specific
day and stock were selected from our wider dataset of 15 stocks across 12 trading days.
For this representative sample, every interval exhibited statistically significant deviations from perfect
homogeneity according to the Likelihood Ratio Test ( _G_ ). As shown in the tables, _p_ -values are consistently less
than 0.01. This statistical rejection is expected given the high frequency of the data, where intervals often
contain within the range of 30,000 – 80,000 transitions ( _N_ ), rendering the chi-squared test highly sensitive to
minor fluctuations.
Crucially, however, these deviations are negligible in practice. The Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) between
sub-interval transition matrices remained well below our conservative threshold of 0.10 for all intervals. For the
Ask sequence in Table S7, the average MAD was 0.035. For the Bid sequence as shown in Table S8, it was
0.030.
This pattern—statistical significance due to large sample sizes but practical homogeneity indicated by low
MAD scores—was consistent across the other remaining days and stocks in our dataset. Consequently, we
conclude that the transition probabilities are sufficiently stable within each 60–75 minute trading interval to
justify the use of time-homogeneous Markov chains for our primary analysis.

_**S4 (b3). Sensitivity to Interval Duration**_
We assessed the robustness of our baseline intraday segmentation comprising 60- and 75-minute intervals
by comparing the resulting pooled Transition Probability Matrices (TPMs) against those derived from
concatenating consecutive interval pairs.
Using AMZN on November 7, 2018, as a representative example, the differences between the TPMs estimated
from the baseline single intervals ( **P** [(][1] _[h]_ [)] ) versus paired intervals ( **P** [(][2] _[h]_ [)] ) pooled data were found to be negligible
in practice. For the Ask sequence, the Frobenius norm of the difference matrix was _dF_ = 1.9 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [5] and
the maximum absolute difference was _d_ max = 1.5 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [5] . Similarly, for the Bid sequence, we observed
_dF_ = 1.8 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [5] and _d_ max = 1.3 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [5] .
All these values are well below our conservative threshold of 10 _[−]_ [4], classifying the matrices as numerically
indistinguishable. Furthermore, the total transition counts differ only by exactly the expected number of
cross-boundary transitions created by concatenation (3 pairs 1 transition = 3), confirming data consistency.
_×_
This extreme similarity indicates that our primary findings are not sensitive to the choice between the baseline
aggregation window and longer, concatenated blocks.

_**S4 (b4). Sensitivity to Equal versus Unequal Interval Segmentation**_
We evaluated whether our baseline choice of unequal-duration trading intervals introduces systematic bias by
comparing it against a uniform 65-minute segmentation. We focused on three critical transitions from the
neutral state (state 5): inertia ( _p_ 5,5), defensive positioning ( _p_ 5,4), and aggressive positioning ( _p_ 5,6).
Tables S9 and S10 present the interval-by-interval comparison for Amazon (AMZN) on November 7, 2018.
The results indicate a high degree of robustness to the segmentation scheme. For the Ask side (Table S9),
the transition probabilities estimated from unequal intervals closely track those from equal intervals. The
maximum absolute difference observed for any single transition across all intervals was only 0.0087 (for _p_ 5,5
during the midday period).
Similarly, the Bid side (Table S10) shows remarkable consistency. The mean absolute difference across all
intervals for price inertia ( _p_ 5,5) was just 0.004. Crucially, after applying the Benjamini-Hochberg correction
for multiple testing, _none_ of the 36 compared pairs (18 for Ask, 18 for Bid) showed a statistically significant
difference ( _p_ adj _>_ 0.05 in all cases).
This analysis confirms that the specific boundaries of our baseline intervals do not artificially generate
the observed intraday patterns. The market microstructure dynamics captured by our model remain stable
regardless of whether standard 65-minute or tailored 60–75 minute windows are employed.
