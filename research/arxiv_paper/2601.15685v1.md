**Abstract**
We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to the _d_ -dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations ( _d ≥_ 3) with initial values _u_ 0 _∈_ _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ), _s ≥_

the proof, first, we construct a supercritical space which has very sparse
inverse logarithmic weight in the frequency domain, compared to the critical homogeneous Sobolev _H_ ˙ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] -norm. Then we obtain the energy
estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the supercritical norm as a factor of the upper bounds. Finally, we superpose the
energy norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of
the critical and subcritical norms independent of the viscosity coefficient
for the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.
As a direct application via the argument of vanishing viscosity, we
obtain global existence of a solution for the incompressible Euler equations
with initial values in _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ), _s ≥−_ 1+ _[d]_ [, which is unique when] _[ s >]_ [ 1+] _[d]_ [.]

### **1 Introduction and main results**


Let us consider the Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes equations:


_ut −_ _ν_ ∆ _u_ + ( _u · ∇_ ) _u_ + _∇p_ = 0 in (0 _, ∞_ ) _×_ R _[d]_ _,_



div _u_ = 0 in (0 _, ∞_ ) _×_ R _[d]_ _,_


_u_ (0 _, x_ ) = _u_ 0 in R _[d]_ _._



(1.1)



Since Leray [17] proved existence of a global weak solution (Leray-Hopf weak
solution) _u_ to (1.1) such that


_u ∈_ _L_ [2] (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ [1] (R _[d]_ )) _∩_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _L_ [2] (R _[d]_ ))

the problem of global regularity of the weak solution for _d ≥_ 3 has been a
consistent key issue.
There is a great number of articles on scaling-invariant regularity criteria
for weak solutions to (1.1). We recall that the Navier-Stokes equations are
invariant by the scaling _uλ_ ( _t, x_ ) _≡_ _λu_ ( _λ_ [2] _t, λx_ ) _, λ >_ 0 _,_ and a critical space for
the equations is the space whose norm is invariant with respect to the scaling


_u_ ( _x_ ) _�→_ _λu_ ( _λx_ ) _, λ >_ 0 _._


The following embedding holds between critical spaces for the _d_ -dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations:


_H_ ˙ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] _�→_ _L_ _[d]_ _�→_ _B_ ˙ _p,_ _[−]_ _∞_ [1+] _[d/p]_ _�→_ _BMO_ _[−]_ [1] _�→_ _B_ [˙] _∞_ _[−]_ [1] _,∞_ _[, d][ ≤]_ _[p <][ ∞][.]_


Eskauraiza, Seregin and Sv´erak in [7](2003) proved that a 3D Leray-Hopf weak
solution _u_ to (1.1) is regular in (0 _, T_ ] if


_u ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, T_ ; _L_ [3] (R [3] )) _,_


employing the backward uniqueness property of parabolic equations. By developing a profile decomposition technique and using the method of “critical
elements” developed in [14]-[16], Gallagher, Koch and Planchon proved for a
mild solution _u_ to (1.1) with initial values in _L_ [3] (R [3] ) that a potential singularity at _t_ = _T_ implies lim _t→T −_ 0 _∥u_ ( _t_ ) _∥_ 3 = _∞_ in [9](2013), and extended the
result from _L_ [3] (R [3] ) to wider critical Besov spaces _B_ [˙] _p,q_ _[−]_ [1+3] _[/p]_ (R [3] ), 3 _< p, q < ∞_
in [10](2016). In [19](2023), the author proved that the above results can be
extended to the largest critical space _B_ [˙] _∞_ _[−]_ [1] _,∞_ [(][R] _[d]_ [) for the case of general] _[ d][ ≥]_ [3,]
that is, a Leray-Hopf weak solution to (1.1) satisfying


_u ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, T_ ; _B_ [˙] _∞_ _[−]_ [1] _,∞_ [(][R] _[d]_ [))]


is regular in (0 _, T_ ] by developing a superposition method of energy norms of
high frequency parts for the weak solution.
Concerning supercritical regularity criteria, we mention recent results [3] and

[4] by Barker and Prange that a 3D Leray-Hopf weak solution _u_ satisfying the
local energy inequality is regular in (0 _, T_ ] if

based on a Tao’s result [21, 22] on quantitative bound of the critical _L_ [3] -norm

Pan [18] and Seregin [20] where logarithmically supercritical regularity criteria
for axisymmetric suitable weak solutions to (1.1) are obtained.


In this paper, we prove global regularity of the Leray-Hopf weak solutions
to (1.1) for initial values in _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ), _d ≥_ 3, _s ≥−_ 1 + _d/_ 2. More precisely, we
have:


**Theorem 1.1** Let _u_ be a Leray-Hopf weak solution to (1.1) with _u_ 0 _∈_ _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ),
_d ≥_ 3, _s ≥−_ 1 + _d/_ 2, and div _u_ 0 = 0. Then,


_u ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ )) _∩_ _L_ [2] (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ [+1] (R _[d]_ ))


and the estimate

holds true with a constant _C_ ( _s_ ) _>_ 0 depending only on _s_ and independent of _ν_
and _d_ . In particular, _u_ is globally regular and unique.


**Remark 1.2** (i) Combining the result of Theorem 1.1 with already known regularity theory of the Navier-Stokes equations, cf. e.g. [1], one can conclude the
following statement:
If _u_ 0 _∈_ _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ), _s ≥−_ 1 + _d/_ 2, div _u_ 0 = 0, then the problem (1.1) has a
unique global strong solution


_u ∈_ _C_ ([0 _, ∞_ ) _, H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ )) _∩_ _L_ [2] (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ [+1] (R _[d]_ ))


satisfying the estimate (1.3).
(ii) The statement of Theorem 1.1 that the estimate constants of higher-order
norms are independent of the viscosity is very important. This fact yields, by
vanishing viscosity, a global existence of solutions for Euler equations of ideal
incompressible fluids, see Theorem 4.2.


We use the following notations. The sets of all natural numbers and all
integers are denoted by N and Z, respectively. The usual _L_ _[p]_ -norm for 1 _≤_
_p ≤∞_ is denoted by _∥· ∥p_ . The Fourier transform of a function _u_ is given by
_Fu ≡_ _u_ ˆ = (2 _π_ ) _[−][d/]_ [2][ �] R _[d][ u]_ [(] _[t, x]_ [)] _[e][ix][·][ξ][ dx]_ [ and] _[ F]_ _[−]_ [1] _[u][ ≡]_ _[u]_ [ˇ][. For] _[ s][ ∈]_ [R][, ˙] _[H]_ _[s]_ [(][R] _[d]_ [) and]

_H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ) stand for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces with
norms


_∥u∥H_ ˙ _s_ (R _d_ ) _≡∥|ξ|_ _[s]_ _u_ ˆ( _ξ_ ) _∥_ 2 and _∥u∥H_ _s_ (R _d_ ) _≡∥_ (1 + _|ξ|_ [2] ) _[s/]_ [2] _u_ ˆ( _ξ_ ) _∥_ 2 _,_


respectively. We use the notation



_u_ _[k]_ ( _t, x_ ) := (2 _π_ ) _[−][d/]_ [2][ �]



_|ξ|≥k_ _[F][u]_ [(] _[t, ξ]_ [)] _[e][ix][·][ξ][ dξ,]_



(1.4)
_uk_ := _u −_ _u_ _[k]_ _, uh,k_ := _u_ _[h]_ _−_ _u_ _[k]_ for 0 _≤_ _h < k._



We do not distinguish between the spaces of vectorial functions and scalar functions.

Let us roughly explain the ideas for the proof of Theorem 1.1 for the particular case _d_ = 3 and _s_ = 1 _/_ 2; the idea is exactly the same for general _d ≥_ 3
and _s_ . As is well-known, the cancelation property (( _v · ∇_ ) _u, u_ ) = 0 for suitably
smooth _u, v_ with div _v_ = 0 is the key to obtain global existence of the LerayHopf weak solutions to (1.1). However, this innermost property was not used,
so long as the author knows, in most previous works for regularity. Indeed, as
long as the convection term ( _u · ∇_ ) _u_ is treated as merely a quadratic nonlinear
term, whatever improvement of its estimate could be made, global regularity
of the weak solution is obtained under a smallness condition of a critical norm
of initial values or under additional scaling-invariant conditions on the weak
solution itself.
In order to circumvent such situations, we use essentially the cancelation
property (( _u · ∇_ ) _u_ _[k]_ _, u_ _[k]_ ) = 0 by testing the momentum equation with high
frequency parts _u_ _[k]_, _k ∈_ N. Then, in the (local) time interval where the weak
solution is regular we have

2 _dt_ _[∥][u][k][∥]_ [2]


usually with a critical space _X_ or, through a more refined observation,


_d_
2 [+] _[ ν][∥∇][u][k][∥]_ 2 [2] _[≤]_ _[c]_ [(] _[k]_ [)] _[∥][u][∥][X]_ 1 _[∥∇][u][k/]_ [2] _[∥]_ [2] 2 _[,][ ∀][k][ ∈]_ [N] _[,]_
2 _dt_ _[∥][u][k][∥]_ [2]


with a supercritical space _X_ 1, where _c_ ( _k_ ) depends on the topology of _X_ 1.
Though this estimate, at the first glance, still seems of no special use due to the
factor _c_ ( _k_ ), we pay attention to the fact that

  - _[k]_ [2] [1] [2]   - _[k]_ [2] [1] [2]




- _∥u_ _[k]_ _∥_ [2] 2 _[∼∥][u]_ [1] _[∥]_ [2] _H_ ˙ 1 _/_ 2 _[,]_ 
_k∈_ N _k∈_ N




- _∥∇u_ _[k]_ _∥_ [2] 2 _[∼∥∇][u]_ [1] _[∥]_ [2] _H_ ˙ 1 _/_ 2

and

  



- _c_ ( _k_ ) _∥∇u_ _[k/]_ [2] _∥_ [2] 2 [≲] _[∥∇][u][∥]_ [2] 2 [+] 
_k∈_ N _n∈_ N



_n∈_ N

Thus, if we can construct a supercritical space _X_ 1 such that the averaging
condition [�] _k_ _[n]_ =1 _[c]_ [(] _[k]_ [)][ ≲] _[n]_ [ is satisfied, then we are led to]

yielding by energy inequality that

for each fixed _t_ . Hence, if additionally uniform smallness of _∥u_ ( _τ_ ) _∥X_ 1 in _τ ∈_ [0 _, t_ ]
can be guaranteed by a suitable re-scaling given for fixed _t_, then in the last term
of the right-hand side the part _c_ �0 _t_ _[∥][u][∥][X]_ [1] _[∥∇][u][∥]_ [2] _H_ ˙ 1 _/_ 2 _[dτ]_ [ can be absorbed into]

the left-hand side and the remaining part can be estimated using the energy
inequality. Thus _∥u_ ( _t_ ) _∥H_ ˙ 1 _/_ 2 ≲ _∥u_ 0 _∥H_ 1 _/_ 2 is obtained irrespective of the viscosity
and _t_ . Remark here that the re-scaling parameter should depend on _t_, but it
does not matter.
We successfully construct a supercritical space _X_ 1 with the above-mentioned
averaging condition and the uniform smallness property by re-scaling, which has
a very sparse inverse logarithmic weight in the frequency domain compared to
the critical _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] -norm, Section 2.
The proof of Theorem 1.1 is given in Section 3.
The regularity estimate for the Navier-Stokes equations, see (1.3), which are
uniform with respect to the viscosity coefficient _ν_ enables us to obtain easily
global solvability for the incompressible Euler equations, Section 4.

### **2 A frequency-weighted scaling-variant space**


In this section, we introduce a supercritical space, the norm of which is quite
slightly weaker than that of _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ).


Let


∆ _ju_ = ( _χj_ ( _ξ_ )ˆ _u_ ( _ξ_ )) _[∨]_ for _j ∈_ Z _, u ∈S_ _[′]_ (R _[d]_ ) with ˆ _u ∈_ _L_ [1] _loc_ [(][R] _ξ_ _[d]_ [)] _[,]_


where _χj_ is the characteristic function of the set _{ξ ∈_ R _[d]_ : 2 _[j][−]_ [1] _≤|ξ| <_ 2 _[j]_ _}_ and
_S_ _[′]_ (R _[d]_ ) is the space of tempered distributions.
It immediately follows by Plancherel’s theorem that for _s ∈_ R the homogeneous Sobolev norm _∥u∥H_ ˙ _s_ (R _d_ ) is equivalent to the norm


             - [�] _∥_ 2 _[sj]_ ∆ _ju∥_ [2] _L_ [2] (R _[d]_ )�1 _/_ 2 _._ (2.1)

_j∈_ Z


Let an infinite sequence _{a_ ( _j_ ) _}j∈_ Z _⊂_ R be such that



_a_ ( _j_ ) :=




log2 _j_ if _j_ = _i_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ for some _k ∈_ N _, i ∈_ Z _, −k ≤_ _i ≤_ _k,_

(2.2)
1 else _._



Let us define the space _X_ 1 by


_X_ 1 := _{v ∈S_ _[′]_ (R _[d]_ ) : ˆ _v_ ( _ξ_ ) _∈_ _L_ [1] _loc_ [(][R] _[d]_ _ξ_ [)] _[,][ {]_ [2] _[j]_ [(] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2)] _[a][−]_ [1][(] _[j]_ [)] _[∥]_ [∆] _[j][v][∥]_ [2] _[}][j][∈]_ [Z] _[ ∈]_ _[l]_ [2] _[}][,]_

_∥v∥X_ 1 := ��� _{_ 2 _a_ ( _j_ ) _∥_ ∆ _jv∥_ 2 _}j∈_ Z��� _l_ 2 _[,]_

(2.3)
where the sequence _{a_ ( _j_ ) _}_ is given by (2.2).
Obviously, _a_ ( _j_ ) = 1 for _j ≤_ 0 and _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ) is densely embedded into
_X_ 1, and
_∥v∥X_ 1 _≤∥v∥H_ ˙ _−_ 1+ _d/_ 2(R _d_ ) _, ∀v ∈_ _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ) _._


We pursue supercritical properties of the space _X_ 1 via the next lemma.

**Lemma 2.1** (i) Let _v ∈_ _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ). Then,

where _M >_ 0 is such that

(ii) Let _u ∈_ _C_ �[0 _, T_ ] _,_ _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )� with 0 _< T < ∞_ . Then, for any sufficiently small _ε >_ 0 there exists _l_ 0 _>_ 0 such that

**Proof:** - _Proof of (i)_ : Let _v ∈_ _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ) and fix _ε >_ 0 arbitrarily. Then, in

_∥v∥H_ ˙ _−_ 1+ _d/_ 2 _∼_ ��� _{_ 2 _∥_ ∆ _jv∥_ 2 _}j∈_ Z��� _l_ 2 _[,]_


there is _M_ = _M_ ( _ε, v_ ) _∈_ N satisfying (2.4).
In the proof, for the moment, we use a short notation _vλ_ := _λv_ ( _λ·_ ). By
definition of the space _X_ 1 we have


_j_ ( _−_ 1+ _d/_ 2) _−_ 1
_∥vλ∥X_ 1 = ��� _{_ 2 _a_ ( _j_ ) _∥_ ∆ _jvλ∥_ 2 _}j∈_ Z��� _l_ 2 _._


Observe that ( _Fvλ_ )( _ξ_ ) = _λ_ ( _Fv_ ( _λ·_ ))( _ξ_ ) = _λ_ [1] _[−][d]_ ( _Fv_ )( _λ_ _[ξ]_ [) for all] _[ λ >]_ [ 0. Then, for]

all _j ∈_ Z

2 _[j][−]_ [1] _≤|η|<_ 2 _[j][−]_ (2.5)

= _λ_ (∆ _j−_ 22 _l v_ )( _λx_ ) _,_



yielding



2 _[j]_ [(] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2)] ∆ _jvλ_ ( _x_ ) = 2 _[j]_ [(] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2)+2][2] _[l]_ (∆ _j−_ 22 _l v_ )( _λx_ ) _, ∀j ∈_ Z _._

Note that
_∥_ (∆ _j−_ 22 _l v_ )( _λ·_ ) _∥_ 2 = _λ_ _[−][d/]_ [2] _∥_ ∆ _j−_ 22 _l v∥_ 2 _._


Therefore, by (2.5) we have

_– Proof of (ii)_ : Let _u ∈_ _C_ ([0 _, T_ ]; _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )) and put


_f_ ( _t, s_ ) := _∥u_ 1 _/s_ ( _t_ ) _∥H_ ˙ _−_ 1+ _d/_ 2 + _∥u_ _[s]_ ( _t_ ) _∥H_ ˙ _−_ 1+ _d/_ 2 _,_ ( _t, s_ ) _∈_ [0 _, T_ ] _×_ [2 _, ∞_ ) _._


Then, _u ∈_ _C_ ([0 _, T_ ]; _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )) implies that _f ∈_ _BC_ ([0 _, T_ ] _×_ [2 _, ∞_ )) and for
all _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ] the mapping _s →_ _f_ ( _t, s_ ) is nonincreasing in _s_ and _f_ ( _t, s_ ) _→_ 0 as

_s →∞_ . Therefore, for any sufficiently small _ε >_ 0 and _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ] there exists
_s_ = _s_ ( _t_ ) satisfying _f_ ( _t, s_ ( _t_ )) = 2 [(] _[d][−]_ _ε_ [1)] _[/]_ [2] [, where one may choose] _[ s]_ [(] _[t]_ [) such that]


_∃N >_ 0 _, ∀t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ] : _|s_ ( _t_ ) _| ≤_ _N_ (2.8)


holds. In fact, if (2.8) does not hold true, there is a sequence _{tn} ⊂_ [0 _, T_ ]
satisfying _f_ ( _tn, s_ ( _tn_ )) = 2 [(] _[d][−]_ _ε_ [1)] _[/]_ [2] [and] _[ s]_ [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ →∞]_ [as] _[ n][ →∞]_ [. Without loss of]
generality, we may assume _tn →_ _t_ [˜] for some _t_ [˜] _∈_ [0 _, T_ ] for _n →∞_ . Then, in view
of _u ∈_ _C_ ([0 _, T_ ] _,_ _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )), we are led to


_ε_

which is a contradiction.
Consequently, if we put


_M_ := [log2 _N_ ] + 2 (with _N_ in (2.8))



then, in view of _N ≤_ 2 _[M]_ _[−]_ [1], we have

and thus (2.4) holds true for _u_ ( _t_ ) uniformly for all _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ].
Thus, for

**Proof:** Note that _a_ ( _j_ ) _≥_ 1 and _b_ ( _j_ + 1) = [1] 2 [(] _[b]_ [(] _[j]_ [) +] _[ a]_ [(] _[j]_ [ + 1)) for all] _[ j][ ∈]_ [N][.]

First we prove the lemma for _j_ = 1 _∼_ 2 [2][1] = 4. We have



_b_ (1) = 2 _[−]_ [2] _·_ 2 _· a_ (1) = [1]



2 _[< a]_ [(1) = 1] _[,]_



_b_ (2) = 2 _[−]_ [3] _·_ (2 + 2 [2] ) = [3]

2 _[a]_ [(3)] = [3+4 log] 8 [2][ 3]



_b_ (3) = _[b]_ [(2)+] _[a]_ [(3)]

(3.2)



_b_ (4) = _[b]_ [(3)+] 2 _[a]_ [(4)] _≤_ 2 = _a_ (4) _._



Next, let us fix any _k ∈_ N and prove the lemma for 2 [2] _[k]_ _< j ≤_ 2 [2] _[k]_ [+1] . Let
_j_ 1 = 2 [2] _[k]_ and assume in view of (3.2) that _b_ ( _j_ 1) _≤_ _a_ ( _j_ 1) which, at the moment,
is satisfied for _k_ = 1. Then, for all _l_ = 1 _,_ 2 _, . . ., k_ we have

Moreover, for _l ∈_ N with 1 _≤_ _l ≤_ 2 [2] _[k]_ [+1] _−_ (2 _k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ ) we have

Hence, if 1 _≤_ _l <_ log2 log2( _k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ ), then we have


_b_ ( _j_ 1 + _k_ + _l_ ) _≤_ log2( _k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ )


and, if log2 log2( _k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ ) _≤_ _l ≤_ 2 [2] _[k]_ [+1] _−_ (2 _k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ ), then we have


_b_ ( _j_ 1 + _k_ + _l_ ) _≤_ 2 _._


9


Note that _k <_ log2 log2( _k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ ) _< k_ + 1 for any _k ∈_ N. Consequently,


_b_ ( _j_ 1 + _k_ + _l_ ) _≤_ log2( _k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ ) _,_ for _l_ = 1 _, . . ., k,_

Finally, we shall prove

In fact, we have

2 _≤_ 2 _[k]_ [+1] = log2 2 [2] _[k]_ [+1] = _a_ (2 [2] _[k]_ [+1] ) _._



Here, in particular, _b_ (2 [2] _[k]_ [+1] ) _≤_ _a_ (2 [2] _[k]_ [+1] ) together with _b_ (4) _≤_ _a_ (4) implies by
induction that the assumption _b_ ( _j_ 1) _≤_ _a_ ( _j_ 1) is satisfied for all _k ∈_ N.
Thus, by (3.2) – (3.4), the proof of the lemma is complete.


In the below we use the notation


_S_ ( _n_ ) = _{l ∈_ N : _l ≤_ _n, −k_ + 2 [2] _[k]_ _≤_ _l ≤_ 2 [2] _[k]_ + 2 _k, ∃k ∈_ N _}, n ∈_ N _._ (3.5)


**Lemma 3.2** The cardinal number _|S_ ( _n_ ) _|_ of the set _S_ ( _n_ ) is estimated by


_|S_ ( _n_ ) _| ≤_ [(3 log][2][ log][2] _[ n]_ [ + 5) log][2][ log][2] _[ n]_ _._

2


**Proof:** Suppose that 2 [2] _[k][−]_ [1] _≤_ _n <_ 2 [2] _[k]_ for some _k ∈_ N. Then, by definition of
_S_ ( _n_ ), we have



_|S_ ( _n_ ) _|_ _≤_

Thus, the lemma is proved.

**Proof of Theorem 1.1:** Since _u_ 0 _∈_ _H_ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ), the problem (1.1) has
a unique local strong (mild) solution _u ∈_ _C_ ([0 _, T_ ) _,_ _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )) (This fact
follows by Kato’s approach just changing _L_ _[d]_ (R _[d]_ ) in [12] with _H_ [˙] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )), cf.

[13]) and it coincides in its existence interval with the corresponding Leray-Hopf
weak solution ([1], Theorem 0.8). Moreover, it is smooth in (0 _, T_ ), as is well
known (cf. e.g. [8]). Let (0 _, T_ ) be the maximal interval where a Leray-Hopf
weak solution _u_ to (1.1) with _u_ 0 _∈_ _H_ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R [3] ) is smooth. It is well-known
that energy inequality (1.2) (even energy equation) is satisfied in (0 _, T_ ).
The remaining proof is divided into two steps.


**Step 1. Energy estimate of high frequency parts:**
Recall the notation (1.4). By _L_ [2] -scalar product to the momentum equation
of (1.1) with _u_ _[k]_ ( _t_ ), _k ≥_ 1, _t ∈_ (0 _, T_ ), we have


_d_
2 _dt_ _[∥][u][k][∥]_ 2 [2] [+] _[ ν][∥∇][u][k][∥]_ 2 [2] [=] _[ −]_ [((] _[u][ · ∇]_ [)] _[u][k][, u][k]_ [)]

= _−_ (( _uk · ∇_ ) _uk_ + ( _u_ _[k]_ _· ∇_ ) _uk, u_ _[k]_ )

= _−_ (( _uk · ∇_ ) _uk/_ 2 _,k, u_ _[k]_ ) _−_ (( _uk/_ 2 _,k · ∇_ ) _uk/_ 2 _, u_ _[k]_ ) _−_ (( _u_ _[k]_ _· ∇_ ) _uk, u_ _[k]_ ) in (0 _, T_ )
(3.6)
in view of _uk_ = _uk/_ 2 + _uk/_ 2 _,k_ and


( _uk, u_ _[l]_ )2 = 0 _,_ supp ( [�] _ukul_ ) _⊂{ξ ∈_ R _[d]_ : _|ξ| ≤_ _k_ + _l},_ _k ≤_ _l < ∞._


In the right-hand side of (3.6) we have


_|_ (( _uk/_ 2 _,k · ∇_ ) _uk/_ 2 _, u_ _[k]_ ) + ( _u_ _[k]_ _· ∇_ ) _uk, u_ _[k]_ ) _| ≤_ ( _∥∇uk/_ 2 _∥∞_ + _∥∇uk∥∞_ ) _∥u_ _[k/]_ [2] _∥_ [2] 2


by H¨older’s inequality. On the other hand, we have


_|_ (( _uk · ∇_ ) _uk/_ 2 _,k, u_ _[k]_ ) _|_ _≤_ _∥uk∥∞∥∇uk/_ 2 _,k∥_ 2 _∥u_ _[k]_ _∥_ 2

_≤_ _k∥uk∥∞∥u_ _[k/]_ [2] _∥_ [2] 2 _[.]_


Therefore, we get from (3.6) that


2 _ddt_ _[∥][u][k][∥]_ 2 [2] [+] _[ ν][∥∇][u][k][∥]_ 2 [2] _[≤]_ [(] _[∥∇][u]_ _k/_ 2 _[∥][∞]_ [+] _[ ∥∇][u][k][∥][∞]_ [+] _[ k][∥][u][k][∥][∞]_ [)] _[∥][u][k/]_ [2] _[∥]_ [2] 2 in (0 _, T_ ) _._

Note here that _C_ ( _s_ ) is irrespective of _d_ and _t_, of course.
Thus we have obtained (3.30) for any fixed _t ∈_ (0 _, T_ ). Since _[s]_ [+1]

for _s ≥_ _d −_ 3, we can conclude from (3.30) that _T_ = _∞_ . Moreover, (3.30) with
_s ≥_ _d −_ 3 implies (1.3) with _s ≥−_ 1 + _d/_ 2.
The proof of the theorem is complete.

**Remark 3.3** The above argument essentially requires that the initial value _u_ 0
should be taken, at least, in _H_ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ) so that a local smooth solution can
exist and the uniform smallness condition (3.27) for the re-scaled solution can
be satisfied.

### **4 Application to global solvability for incom-** **pressible Euler equations**


The above regularity result for the Navier-Stokes system can be directly applied
to showing the global existence of solutions to the Euler equations of ideal
incompressible fluids:


_ut_ + ( _u · ∇_ ) _u_ + _∇p_ = 0 in (0 _, ∞_ ) _×_ R _[d]_ _,_



div _u_ = 0 in (0 _, ∞_ ) _×_ R _[d]_ _,_


_u_ (0 _, x_ ) = _u_ 0 in R _[d]_ ( _d ≥_ 3) _._



(4.1)



Let us denote by _a_ _⊗_ _b_ := ( _aibj_ ) for vectors _a, b ∈_ R _[d]_ and _A_ : _B_ =

[�]



Let us denote by _a_ _⊗_ _b_ := ( _aibj_ ) for vectors _a, b ∈_ R and _A_ : _B_ = [�] _i,j_ _[a][ij][b][ij]_

for matrices _A_ = ( _aij_ ) _, B_ = ( _bij_ ) _∈_ R _[d][×][d]_ . A _d_ -dimensional divergence-free
vector field _u ∈_ _L_ [2] loc [([0] _[,][ ∞]_ [)] _[ ×]_ [ R] _[d]_ [) is called a weak solution to (4.1) if it satisfies]
the equations in a weak sense, i.e.,

   - _∞_    -    0 R _[d]_ [(] _[u][ ·][ φ][t]_ [ + (] _[u][ ⊗]_ _[u]_ [) :] _[ ∇][φ]_ [)] _[dxdt]_ [ +] R _[d][ u]_ [0][(] _[x]_ [)] _[ ·][ φ]_ [(0] _[, x]_ [)] _[dx]_ [ = 0] _[,]_




               R _[d]_ [(] _[u][ ·][ φ][t]_ [ + (] _[u][ ⊗]_ _[u]_ [) :] _[ ∇][φ]_ [)] _[dxdt]_ [ +]



R _[d][ u]_ [0][(] _[x]_ [)] _[ ·][ φ]_ [(0] _[, x]_ [)] _[dx]_ [ = 0] _[,]_



(4.2)
_∀φ ∈_ _C_ 0 _[∞]_ [([0] _[,][ ∞]_ [)] _[ ×]_ [ R] _[d]_ [) (div] _[ φ]_ [ = 0)] _[.]_



**Remark 4.1** (i) If _u_ is a weak solution to (4.1), then by De Rham’s theorem
there is a distribution _p_ such that _{u, p}_ satisfies the equations of (4.1) in the
distribution sense.
(ii) Suppose a weak solution _u_ to (4.1) belongs to _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ )) for
_s >_ 1+ _[d]_ 2 [. It then follows by the Sobolev embedding] _[ H]_ _[s][−]_ [1][(][R] _[d]_ [)] _[ �][→]_ _[L][∞]_ [(][R] _[d]_ [) that]

( _u · ∇_ ) _u ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _L_ [2] (R _[d]_ )) and


_−_ ∆ _p_ = div ( _u · ∇_ ) _u ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[−]_ [1] (R _[d]_ ))


holds for the corresponding associated pressure _p_ . Consequently, _∇p_ and hence
_ut_ belong to _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _L_ [2] (R _[d]_ )). Therefore, _u_ becomes a strong solution to (4.1).


For (4.1) in 3D setting, nonuniqueness of weak solutions for some initial
values is proved (e.g. in [6],[11]) and local existence of a unique strong solution
for _u_ 0 _∈_ _H_ _[s]_ (R [3] ) _, s >_ 5 _/_ 2 _,_ is known (cf. [2]). However, there seems no general
establishment asserting global existence of a solution under a certain regularity
assumption on the initial values.


As a corollary of Theorem 1.1, we can obtain the following global solvability
for (4.1).


18


**Theorem 4.2** Let _u_ 0 _∈_ _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ), _d ≥_ 3, _s ≥−_ 1 + _d/_ 2, div _u_ 0 = 0. Then the
Cauchy problem (4.1) has a global weak solution such that


_u ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ))


and
_∥u∥L∞_ (0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _s_ (R _d_ )) _≤_ _C∥u_ 0 _∥H_ _s_ (R _d_ ) (4.3)


with some constant _C >_ 0. This solution is unique if _s >_ 1 + _d/_ 2.



**Proof:** The proof is based on the argument of Navier-Stokes regularization
of the problem (4.1) and vanishing viscosity. Observe the Navier-Stokes problem
(1.1) with the same initial value _u_ 0.
By Theorem 1.1, the Navier-Stokes problem (1.1) has a unique solution
_uν ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ )) satisfying

 - _∞_ - 0 R _[d]_ [(] _[u][ν][ ·][ φ][t][ −]_ _[ν][∇][u][ν][ · ∇][φ]_ [ + (] _[u][ν][ ⊗]_ _[u][ν]_ [) :] _[ ∇][φ]_ [)] _[dxdt]_ [ +] R _[d][ u]_ [0][(] _[x]_ [)] _[ ·][ φ]_ [(0] _[, x]_ [)] _[dx]_ [ = 0]

R _[d][ u]_ [0][(] _[x]_ [)] _[ ·][ φ]_ [(0] _[, x]_ [)] _[dx]_ [ = 0] _[,]_



_∀φ ∈_ _C_ 0 _[∞]_ [([0] _[,][ ∞]_ [)] _[ ×]_ [ R] _[d]_ [) (div] _[ φ]_ [ = 0)] _[,]_
(4.4)
and
_∥uν∥L∞_ (0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _s_ (R _d_ )) _≤_ _C_ ( _s_ ) _∥u_ 0 _∥H_ _s_ (R _d_ ) _,_ (4.5)


where _C_ ( _s_ ) is independent of _ν_ .
Let _u ∈_ _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ )) be the weak- _∗_ limit of a subsequence of _{uν}ν>_ 0
(say, _{uν}ν>_ 0 again). Since


_∞_   _ν_ ���0 R _[d][ ∇][u][ν][ · ∇][φ dxdt]_ �� _≤_ _ν∥uν∥L∞_ (0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _s_ (R _d_ )) _∥_ ∆ _φ∥L_ 1(0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _−s_ (R _d_ ))

_≤_ _νC∥u_ 0 _∥H_ _s_ (R _d_ ) _∥_ ∆ _φ∥L_ 1(0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _−s_ (R _d_ )) _→_ 0 ( _ν →_ 0)



for all _φ ∈_ _C_ 0 _[∞]_ [([0] _[,][ ∞]_ [)] _[ ×]_ [ R] _[d]_ [), the integral identity (4.2) will be satisfied by] _[ u]_
provided
�0 _∞_ �R _[d]_ [(] _[u][ν][ ⊗]_ _[u][ν]_ [) :] _[ ∇][φdxdt][ →]_ �0 _∞_ �R _[d]_ [(] _[u][ ⊗]_ _[u]_ [) :] _[ ∇][φdxdt]_ ( _ν →_ 0) _,_




            - _∞_            R _[d]_ [(] _[u][ν][ ⊗]_ _[u][ν]_ [) :] _[ ∇][φdxdt][ →]_ 0



R _[d]_ [(] _[u][ ⊗]_ _[u]_ [) :] _[ ∇][φdxdt]_ ( _ν →_ 0) _,_

_∀φ ∈_ _C_ 0 _[∞]_ [([0] _[,][ ∞]_ [)] _[ ×]_ [ R] _[d]_ [) (div] _[ φ]_ [ = 0)] _[.]_



Let a distribution _pν_ be an associated pressure for (1.1) corresponding to
_uν_, that is, the pair _{uν, pν}_ satisfies the momentum equation of (1.1) in the
distribution sense. Since


_H_ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ) _· H_ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ) _�→_ _H_ _[−]_ [1] _[/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ ) _, d ≥_ 3 _,_ (4.7)


it follows by (4.5) that _{uν⊗uν}ν>_ 0 is uniformly bounded in _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[−]_ [1] _[/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )).
On the other hand, since the associated pressure _pν_ satisfies


_−_ ∆ _pν_ = div div ( _uν ⊗_ _uν_ ) _,_


we have, in view of (4.7),


_∥pν∥L∞_ (0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _−_ 1 _/_ 2(R _d_ )) _≤_ _C∥uν ⊗_ _uν∥L∞_ (0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _−_ 1 _/_ 2(R _d_ ))
_≤_ _C∥uν∥_ [2] _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _,∞_ ; _H_ _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )) _[≤]_ _[C][∥][u]_ [0] _[∥]_ _H_ [2] _[−]_ [1+] _[d/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )


19


with _C >_ 0 independent of _ν >_ 0. Therefore, in view of


_uνt_ = ∆ _uν −_ div ( _uν ⊗_ _uν_ ) _−∇pν,_


it follows that _{uνt}ν>_ 0 is uniformly bounded in _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[−]_ [3] _[/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )).
Since _{uν}ν>_ 0 and _{uνt}ν>_ 0 are uniformly bounded in _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ ))
and in _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[−]_ [3] _[/]_ [2] (R _[d]_ )), respectively, the restriction of both sequences on
(0 _, T_ ) _× G_ for any finite _T >_ 0 and smooth bounded domain _G ⊂_ R _[d]_ are
uniformly bounded in _L_ [2] (0 _, T_ ; _H_ _[s]_ ( _G_ )) and in _L_ [2] (0 _, T_ ; _H_ _[−]_ [3] _[/]_ [2] ( _G_ )), respectively,
Therefore, it follows by Aubin’s lemma on compactness that, possibly with a
new subsequence,


_uν →_ _u_ in _L_ [2] (0 _, T_ ; _L_ [2] ( _G_ )) as _ν →_ 0 (strongly) _._



Consequently, (4.6) holds and _u_ is a weak solution satisfying (4.2) and (4.3).
Let us prove the uniqueness of the solution in _L_ _[∞]_ (0 _, ∞_ ; _H_ _[s]_ (R _[d]_ )) for _s >_
1 + _[d]_ 2 [. Let] _[ u]_ [1] _[, u]_ [2] _[ ∈]_ _[L][∞]_ [(0] _[,][ ∞]_ [;] _[ H]_ _[s]_ [(][R] _[d]_ [)),] _[ s >]_ [ 1 +] _[d]_ 2 [, be two solutions to (4.1), and]

let _u ≡_ _u_ 1 _−_ _u_ 2 and _p ≡_ _p_ 1 _−_ _p_ 2 with corresponding associated pressure _p_ 1, _p_ 2.
Then,
_ut_ + ( _u · ∇_ ) _u_ 1 + ( _u_ 2 _· ∇_ ) _u_ + _∇p_ = 0 in (0 _, ∞_ ) _._



Hence, in view of Remark 4.1 (ii), we have


( _ut, u_ ) _L_ 2 + �( _u · ∇_ ) _u_ 1 _, u_           

which yields



in (0 _, ∞_ ) _,_
_L_ [2][ = 0]

2 _dt_ _[∥][u]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[∥]_ [2]


Thus, by Gronwall’s inequality we have _u_ ( _t_ ) _≡_ 0 _, ∀t ∈_ (0 _, ∞_ ).
The proof of the theorem is complete.
