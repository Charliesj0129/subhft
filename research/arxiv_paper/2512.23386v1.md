**Abstract.** We study Arbitrum’s _Express Lane Auction_ (ELA), an aheadof-time second-price auction that grants the winner an exclusive latency
advantage for one minute. Building on a single-round model with riskaverse bidders, we propose a hypothesis that the value of priority access
is discounted relative to risk-neutral valuation due to the difficulty of
forecasting short-horizon volatility and bidders’ risk aversion. We test
these predictions using ELA bid records matched to high-frequency ETH
prices and find that the result is consistent with the model.

**1** **Introduction**


**1.1** **Background**


Timeboost, a novel transaction ordering policy introduced in [25] and subsequently implemented by Offchain Labs, has recently been deployed on the Arbitrum mainnet [31]. Under the Timeboost policy, transactions are delivered to the
sequencer through two distinct channels: the normal lane and the Express Lane
(EL). While the sequencer processes transactions in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
manner, transactions submitted via the normal lane incur a 200-millisecond delay before being forwarded to the sequencer. Conversely, the EL immediately
forwards received transactions, thereby offering its users a 200-millisecond latency advantage.
The temporary right to utilize the EL is periodically allocated for each
round—which lasts for one minute—via a second-price sealed-bid auction termed
the _Express Lane Auction (ELA)_ [3] . This auction operates on an ahead-of-time
basis; participants in the ELA are required to estimate the value of the good
(the right to use the EL in the forthcoming round), submit their bids, and pay if
they win, prior to exercising their EL access. Given that the latency differential
is barely noticeable to typical users, participation and bidding in the ELA are

it to other parties. For instance, [20] is currently running a secondary market that

primarily confined to latency-sensitive players, such as High-Frequency Traders
(HFTs). The primary objective of this mechanism is to capture a portion of
the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) generated, without compromising the
experience of the typical user, by imposing charges solely on strategic players,
frequently referred to as _searchers_ .
Searchers value access to EL due to the 200-millisecond latency advantage,
which is typically sufficient to secure the majority of CEX-DEX arbitrage opportunities for each arbitrage oppportunities [4] . Given that CEX-DEX arbitrage
profit is directly proportional to the integrated variance _IV_ ( _≡_ �0 _T_ _[σ]_ _t_ [2] _[dt]_ [)][ of risky]
assets, bidding in ELA yields a payoff analogous to a long position in a variance swap. Previous research has identified a discount in variance swap markets,
termed the _Variance Risk Premium (VRP)_, which represents the discrepancy
between the theoretical fair price (derived from a replicating portfolio) and the
observed market price. Studies such as [4] and [9] attribute the existence of VRP
to the stochastic nature of volatility and traders’ risk aversion. Consequently, a
similar question arises for ELA: do bidders submit bids below the expected CEXDEX arbitrage profit for an upcoming round? This study addresses questions
concerning the factors influencing Timeboost’s performance and their impact,
including the aforementioned phenomenon.
More specifically, we endeavor to answer the following research questions: _(i)_
Does a discount analogous to VRP exist in ELA? _(ii)_ If such a discount exists,
what is its primary causal mechanism? and _(iii)_ What is the intensity of this
discount effect?
Our findings indicate that _(i)_ a comparable discount does exist, and _(ii)_ it
is consistent with the inherent difficulty in forecasting the future volatility of
risky assets within a short time horizon. We also provide an estimation of the
intensity of this effect.
This study is one of the first empirical investigations into the performance
of Timeboost, examining the determinants of bidder valuations and the efficacy
of express lane auctions. As such, it establishes a foundational reference for subsequent research that employs more sophisticated methodologies and realistic
assumptions. Ultimately, this investigation seeks to enhance the understanding of time-based sequencing mechanisms, including Timeboost, within auction
frameworks.


**1.2** **Related Literature**


_Loss-versus-rebalancing and CEX-DEX Arbitrage._ Following the foundational
work of [12], which introduced the term Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), a
substantial body of literature has emerged exploring both its theoretical and empirical aspects. Early on, both academia and practitioners recognized CEX-DEX


4 This does not universally hold true. For instance, if the latency advantage is insufficiently large, a probabilistic strategy involving transaction spamming can still
capture a non-negligible portion of opportunities. For further details, refer to [24].
Generally, a 200-millisecond gap is considered big enough to mitigate such possibilities.

arbitrage as the primary source of MEV, commonly measured using short-term
( _≤_ 5 minutes) markouts [37,17,18,33,10,11]. Subsequently, [29] provided a theoretical justification for such a metric and introduced Loss-Versus-Rebalancing
(LVR), which has been generalized to more realistic settings in later works,
including [28] and [30]. These studies, while differing in their specific details,
consistently demonstrate a close relationship between CEX-DEX arbitrage and
LVR, which represents the adverse selection cost borne by Automated Market
Makers (AMMs). After abstracting away fees, gas costs, and inventory risk, the
leading term of this relationship is shown to be _O_ ( _σ_ [2] ), where _σ_ denotes the
instantaneous volatility of the asset price.


_Time-based Transaction Ordering Policies and Timeboost._ Even before the advent of blockchain technology, time-based transaction ordering policies and associated products were well established and widely adopted. For instance, since
the late 2000s, traditional finance (TradFi) exchanges have commercialized latency, offering “speed technology” to high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, generating revenues exceeding $ 700 million in 2017 [8]. The impact of asymmetric
speed bumps and micro-burst fees, exemplifying such exotic transaction ordering policies (priority rules), has been investigated by [2] and [7]. Timeboost,
as introduced in [25], aligns with these policies, and [24] and [16] provide a
comprehensive theoretical understanding of its mechanisms. While Timeboost
generated over 1400 ETH in revenue from May to October, demonstrating its
effectiveness, empirical research in this area remains nascent, with [27] and [26]
among the pioneering works that explore bidder behavior in ELA and the performance of Timeboost. In particular, the latter work claimed that the bidders’
bids can be used as a noisy proxy for the markout of arbitrageurs’ trades in the
subsequent round.


_Variance Risk Premia and Risk Aversion._ A large body of literature documents
a systematic wedge between the replication-based (risk-neutral) fair value of a
variance swap and its traded price, commonly referred to as the variance (or

volatility) risk premium (VRP). The “fair” strike for variance swap can be synthesized from an option strip [13] or via model-free implied variance [19], and the
VRP is typically measured as implied minus subsequently realized variance (RV)

[9]. Empirically, this wedge is time-varying and (on average) negative, consistent
with investors’ risk aversion and a stochastic nature of volatility that loads on
variance and tail risks [3,4,6,5]. Beyond level effects, the term structure and composition of premia matter as well: short-horizon variance premia are especially
volatile and command higher compensation, and downside (“bad”) variance carries a larger premium than upside variance [14,1,15]. The phenomenon is not
equity-specific: analogous variance premia appear in foreign exchange (FX) and
commodity markets, indicating a broad, asset-agnostic compensation for variance and jump risks [23,34,36]. Collectively, these results suggest that forwardlooking prices for variance-linked payoffs can be persistently discounted relative
to their “fair” values when risk is borne by risk-averse traders.


**1.3** **Roadmap**


The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides a theoretical foundation for the proposed model and hypothesis. Section 3
outlines the data sources and the analytical methodologies employed, presents
results, and discusses the findings and their implications. The paper concludes
with Section 4, which summarizes the key findings and potential future research
topics.


**2** **Theory**


In this section, we provide a theoretical derivation of how bidders value the
express lane (EL). We model each round of the express lane auction (ELA) as
a second-price sealed-bid auction for a single, exclusive right to use the EL for
a one-minute period, within a conditionally independent private value (CIPV)
framework. We assume the winner captures the arbitrage opportunity solely
during this period.
We first review how CEX-DEX arbitrage profit is related to the volatility of
risky assets. We then specify the auction environment and timing and derive the
bidders’ payoffs. From the payoff, we infer bidders’ valuations and their bids,
and finally present a reduced-form model and hypotheses for empirical testing.


**2.1** **Arbitrageurs’ Profit**


Since the value of the express lane is closely related to MEV, and most of
that MEV comes from CEX-DEX arbitrage, it is important to understand arbitrageurs’ profits to correctly value the express lane. In this section, as mentioned
earlier, we review the theory of CEX-DEX arbitrage. For simplicity, consider a
single constant product market maker (CPMM) pool with an invariant _L_ [2] that
consists of a risky asset and a stablecoin. We assume the log price of the risky

asset at CEX, which is a _true_ price, follows a semi-martingale process with
stochastic volatility,
_d_ (log _Pt_ ) = _µtdt_ + _σtdWt ._


[29] then showed that loss-versus-rebalancing, which is the arbitrageur’s revenue
under ideal settings (i.e., no gas fee and no friction in trading), is proportional
to the pool value and volatility of the risky asset.

revenue is proportional to the pool’s value and the square of the asset’s volatility.


**2.2** **Express Lane Auction**


Here, we clarify the mechanism of the express lane auction (ELA) and its timing.
Participants in ELA compete in each round, lasting a minute, for the exclusive
right to use the express lane. They want such a right because those with access to
the express lane can win all the CEX-DEX arbitrage opportunities. The auction
is conducted as a sealed-bid second-price auction, with the bidding deadline
strictly before the start of each round. Therefore, the bidders should calculate the
value of the express lane based on both public and private information provided
to each bidder, and submit a bid before the value is realized. We begin with the
following definitions.


**Definition 1 (Rounds, Periods, Bidders, Information, and Reward).**
_Let:_

**–** _r ∈_ N _be each round of ELA,_


6 K. Sunghun and J. Park


**–** [ _Tr, Tr_ +1) _be period of each round,_

**–** _Dr < Tr be the deadline of bid submission for each round,_

**–** _S ≡{_ 1 _,_ 2 _, · · ·, N_ _} be set of bidders,_

**–** _Fr and Sir be public and private information for bidder i available at Dr,_
_respectively,_

**–** _vir be bidder i’s valuation at round r, and_

**–** _bir be bidder i’s bid at round r._


**2.3** **Bidders’ Payoff and Valuation**


We now derive how bidders value the right to use the express lane in a given
round. For notational convenience, write


                  - _Tr_ +1
IV _r_ IV[ _Tr,Tr_ +1) = _σt_ [2] _[dt]_
_≡_ _Tr_


for the integrated variance over round _r_ . The winner at round _r_ will earn profit
from arbitrage opportunities within that round. Thus the reward _Rr_ is




   - _Tr_ +1
_Rr_ =

_Tr_



LVR _dt ≈_ _[L]_ �4 _PTr_ IV _r,_



where _L_ is liquidity available and IV[ _Tr,Tr_ +1) is integrated variance of risky asset
from _Tr_ to _Tr_ +1. [5] Note that _Rr_ is random variable and only fully realized after
time _Tr_ +1. In practice, even with express lane access, a bidder may only capture
a fraction of the available arbitrage, and may face idiosyncratic costs or benefits
(e.g., private order flow, infrastructure frictions). [6] We model the _net_ profit of
bidder _i_ from winning round _r_ as


_Πir_ = _αir_ + _βir_ IV _r_ ~~�~~ _PTr_ _,_ (5)


where:


**–** _αir_ collects components of profit and cost that do not scale with volatility
(e.g., fixed costs, long-tail MEV),

**–** _βir_ is bidder _i_ ’s _extraction efficiency_ in round _r_, summarizing how effectively the bidder converts volatility into arbitrage revenue. In particular, _βir_
subsumes both the liquidity factor _L/_ 4 and the bidder’s share of the total
arbitrage _Rr_ .


5 While traders use the entire liquidity available, beyond a single CPMM pool, if the
price does not move much within a round, we can still locally approximate it as a
single big CPMM pool; see [35]. Through the paper, we assume that _L_ is constant.
It is roughly true, since the majority of liquidity is provided by professional LPs who
concentrate liquidity near the current price most of the time.
6
Note that this does not necessarily imply that others can take advantage of it and
earn profit. If such friction exists, it is very likely that others will have to bear that
friction as well, which makes trade unprofitable.


Volatility and Time-Based Ordering Policies 7


Both _αir_ and _βir_ are measurable with respect to bidder _i_ ’s private information
_Sir_ and the public information _Fr_ available at the bidding deadline _Dr_ .
Conditional on ( _r,_ _ir_ ), bidder _i_ forms a belief on the distribution over IV _r_
_F_ _S_
and thus over _Πir_ . Let


_m_ [IV] _ir_ and _vir_ [IV] (6)

_[≡]_ [E][ [IV] _[r]_ _[| F][r][,][ S][ir]_ []] _[≡]_ [Var (IV] _[r]_ _[| F][r][,][ S][ir]_ [)]

denote bidder _i_ ’s forecast mean and variance of integrated variance for round _r_ .
Since _PTr_ is (approximately) known at _Dr_, we obtain



E[ _Πir | Fr, Sir_ ] = _αir_ + _βirm_ [IV] _ir_ 


_PTr,_ (7)



Var( _Πir | Fr, Sir_ ) = _βir_ [2] _[v]_ _ir_ [IV] _[P][T]_ _r_ _[.]_ (8)



We now introduce a key assumption: the conditional independence of bidders’
valuation and risk aversion.


**Assumption 1 (CIPV).** _Conditional on the public information_ _r, bidders’_
_F_
_valuations parameters_

_{_ ( _αir, βir, γir, m_ [IV] _ir_ _[, v]_ _ir_ [IV][)] _[}]_ _i_ _[N]_ =1

_are independently drawn._


Assumption 1 formalizes the “conditionally independent private values” (CIPV)
environment: public information _Fr_ is common to all bidders, while private signals _Sir_ generate heterogeneous valuations through the parameters

( _αir, βir, γir, m_ [IV] _ir_ _[, v]_ _ir_ [IV][)] _[,]_


which reflects the reality: while there are public signals observable to everyone,
such as recent prices and order flow on exchanges, each firm relies on one’s
proprietary models to forecast future volatility, and each firm’s edge or alpha of
finding optimal route or executing trades remain private.


**Assumption 2 (Preferences).** _Each bidder i is risk-averse and evaluates_
_random profits using a mean–variance functional. That is, there exists a risk-_
_aversion parameter ρir >_ 0 _such that the certainty equivalent (CE) of any profit_
_random variable X in round r is_


CE _ir_ ( _X_ ) = E[ _X_ ]
_−_ _[ρ]_ 2 _[ir]_ [Var(] _[X]_ [)] _[.]_


Under Assumption 2, bidder _i_ ’s valuation of the express lane in round _r_ is
the certainty equivalent of _Πir_ :


_vir_ CE _ir_ ( _Πir_ ) = E[ _Πir_ _r,_ _ir_ ] (9)
_≡_ _| F_ _S_ _−_ _[ρ]_ 2 _[ir]_ [Var(] _[Π][ir][ | F][r][,][ S][ir]_ [)] _[ .]_


Substituting (7) and (8) into (9) yields



_vir_ = _αir_ + _βirm_ [IV] _ir_ 

= _αir_ + _βirm_ [IV] _ir_  


_PTr_ _−_ _[ρ]_ 2 _[ir]_

_−_




_[ir]_

2 _[β]_ _ir_ [2] _[v]_ _ir_ [IV] _[P][T]_ _r_


8 K. Sunghun and J. Park


where we define
_γir_ _ir_ _[>]_ [ 0] _[.]_
_≡_ _[ρ]_ 2 _[ir]_ _[β]_ [2]

Equation (10) makes explicit that higher expected volatility (integrated variance)
increases valuations, while greater uncertainty about volatility lowers valuations
through the risk-aversion term.


**2.4** **Auction Equilibrium and Empirical Implications**


Given the valuation structure in (10), we now describe bidding behavior in the
express lane auction. In each round _r_, bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids
_{bir}i_ _[N]_ =1 [. The bidder with the highest bid wins the right to use the express lane]
during [ _Tr, Tr_ +1) and pays the second-highest bid, while all other bidders pay
zero. The following proposition justifies the use of the submitted bid as the
bidder’s valuation.


**Proposition 2 (Equilibrium Bidding).** _Under Assumptions 2 and 1, in each_
_round r of the express lane auction, it is a (weakly) dominant strategy for each_
_bidder to bid her valuation:_


_bir_ = _vir_ _for all i ∈{_ 1 _, . . ., N_ _}._

Proposition 2 is the standard truth-telling result for second-price auctions
with private values; see, for example, [21]. Combining Proposition 2 with (10),
we obtain the structural relationship



_bir_ = _αir_ + _βirm_ [IV] _ir_ 


_PTr_ _γirvir_ [IV] _[P][T]_ _r_ _[.]_ (11)
_−_



Equation (11) shows that, in our model, equilibrium bids are increasing in the
bidder’s forecast of integrated variance and decreasing in the forecast uncertainty
about integrated variance, with both effects scaled by the current asset price.
This link motivates our empirical specification.
In the data, we do not observe the latent objects ( _αir, βir, γir, m_ [IV] _ir_ _[, v]_ _ir_ [IV][)][ di-]
rectly. Instead, we approximate (11) by a reduced-form model in which expected
integrated variance and its uncertainty are replaced by observable proxies and
bidder- or round-specific components are absorbed into fixed effects. Specifically,
in the subsequent section we estimate regressions of the form



_bir_ = _θ_ 0 _,i_ + _θ_ 1 _,i_ E [�] [IV _r_ ]�



_PTr_ + _θ_ 2 _,i_ Var(IV� _r_ ) _PTr_ + _εir,_ (12)



where:

**–** E [�] [IV _r_ ] is a proxy of forecast mean _m_ [IV] _ir_ [,]

**–** Var(IV� _r_ ) is a proxy for the forecast variance _vir_ [IV][, and]

**–** _εir_ is an error term.


Under (11), the theory predicts _θ_ 1 _,i >_ 0 and _θ_ 2 _,i <_ 0: bids should increase with
expected volatility (more MEV to extract) and decrease with uncertainty about
volatility (stronger risk discount). These sign restrictions form our main testable
hypotheses.


Volatility and Time-Based Ordering Policies 9


**3** **Empirical Analysis**


**3.1** **Data**


_Auction Records._ For the auction bids, we obtained the data directly from Arbitrum’s database [32]. Our sample spans bids from May to October 2025. While
multiple bidders participate, we focus on the two most dominant participants,
`0x8c6f` and `0x95c0`, who together win over 90% of rounds between May and
October.


_Measuring Volatility._ We proxy market-wide volatility using high-frequency ETH
price data from Binance. As ETH is the most liquid crypto-asset on Arbitrum [7],
focusing on ETH serves as a low-friction approximation of overall market conditions. While price follows a stochastic process and thus the integrated variance is
also essentially random, all we have is historical data of a single _realized_ path out
of all possible outcomes. Therefore, we have to estimate E[IV] and Var(IV) from
the given path of price. We adopt a standard approach, treating the realized
variance (RV), the sum of squares of log returns _rt_, as E [�] [IV], while estimating
Var(IV)� with the following Newey-West estimator:



Var(IV) =� _T_ ( _γ_ 0 + 2

where

- _t_ =1 ( _rt_ [2] + _k_ _[−]_ _[r]_ [2][)(] _[r]_ _t_ [2] _[−]_ _[r]_ [2][)] and _r_ [2] _≡_ _T_ [1]

_t_ =1



for _k_ = 0 _,_ 1 _,_ 2 _, · · ·_, and _wk ≡_ 1 _−_ _L_ +1 _k_ [is weight function. The standard practice]
of setting _L_ is of _L_ = _O_ ( _T_ [1] _[/]_ [3] ). In our setting, we set _T_ = 60 and _L_ = 5.


_Bidder Forecasts._ The theoretical model proposed in Section 2 posits that bids
depend on bidders’ private forecasts of realized variance, which are unobservable.
We therefore adopt the following assumption to bridge the theory with our expost volatility measures:


**Assumption 3 (On-average Correct Forecast).** _Bidders are capable of_ onaverage _correctly forecasting the mean and variance of forthcoming_ IV _r based on_
_public and private information available at time Dr. That is, for_



_ϵir_ _m_ [IV] _ir_ _and_ _τir_ _vir_ [IV]
_≡_ _[−]_ [E][[IV] _[r]_ []] _≡_ _[−]_ [Var(IV] _[r]_ [)] _[,]_



E [ _ϵir|Fr_ ] = E [ _τir|Fr_ ] = 0 _._ [8]



7 We exclude stablecoins; see [22].
8
Note that this does not necessarily violate the CIPV framework. One can interpret
this assumption that, based on public information, it is possible to, on average,
correctly forecast the mean and variance of IV. Then _ϵir_ and _τir_ being independent
and private is sufficient for the CIPV setting.


10 K. Sunghun and J. Park


This errors-in-variables framework implies that our estimates of _θ_ 1 and _θ_ 2 will
be subject to attenuation bias, which will bias them towards zero. Consequently,
finding statistically significant coefficients despite this bias would provide a conservative and even stronger confirmation of our hypotheses.


**3.2** **Estimation**


Our dependent variable, the observed bid _bir_, is left-censored at the reserve price
_C_ = 0 _._ 001 ETH. To account for the fat tails often observed in financial data, we
employ a heteroskedastic Tobit model, assuming that the normalized residuals
follow a Student’s t distribution. Also, the bid unit is in ETH, while the bidder’s
valuation is in USD. Thus, we divide the bidder’s valuation by the ETH price
at each round. [9] Then, the model is defined as follows:


_bir_ = max( _C, vir_ _[∗]_ [)] (13)

E�[IV]
_vir_ _[∗]_ [=] _[ θ]_ [0] [+] _[ θ]_ [1] + _θ_ 2Var(IV) + [�] _εir_ (14)

where _vir_ _[∗]_ [is the latent valuation of bidder] _[ i]_ [ for round] _[ r]_ [,] _[ b][ir]_ [ is the observed bid,]
E�[IV] and Var(IV)� are estimated mean and variance of integrated variance of
given round, _σr_ is the conditional scale (standard deviation) of the latent valuation, modeled in log-linear form to ensure positivity, and _t_ ( _ν_ ) is the Student’s
t-distribution with _ν_ degrees of freedom, which is also estimated. We also ad

_Pr_
_×_ _×_ _×_
for numerical stability. Our hypotheses from the end of the previous section then
translate to testing the coefficients in the mean model (Equation 14):


**– H1** : _θ_ **1** _>_ **0** . A positive _θ_ 1 supports that higher expected volatility leads to
higher valuations.

**– H2** : _θ_ **2** _<_ **0** . A negative _θ_ 2 supports the conclusion that higher uncertainty
(forecast variance) leads to a larger risk-aversion discount and thus to lower
valuations.


In addition to the linear specification derived from the mean-variance framework, we also estimate a log-log specification (where both bids and volatility
measures are logged). While the linear model follows directly from our theoretical assumptions, the log-log specification offers strong empirical justifications.


9 The division on constant term is omitted, since the range of price (minimum 1 _._ 7k
and maximum 4 _._ 9k USD) was negligible compared to that of the estimated mean
and variance of IV.


Volatility and Time-Based Ordering Policies 11


First, it systematically enforces nonnegative valuations, ruling out the theoretical possibility of negative bids implied by linear risk adjustments. Second, since
the integrated variance and bids are numerically small values spanning multiple
orders of magnitude, the log-log transformation mitigates the influence of extreme outliers and heteroskedasticity. Under these conditions, the log-log form
can be interpreted as a first-order approximation of the equilibrium relationship,
capturing potential nonlinearities in risk aversion (e.g., CRRA preferences) while
serving as a strict robustness check for our main findings.

Table 1 shows the result of the estimates. For comparison, we also attach
the result from the restricted model, which is identical to the original model
except that the latent valuation depends only on E [�] [IV]. This corresponds to the
risk-neutral bidder’s valuation. The first column corresponds to the restricted
model, and the second to the previously introduced full model.
Across bidders, augmenting the specification with a variance term significantly improves the fit: LR tests are significant, and information criteria drop
substantially. In the location equation, _θ_ 1 _>_ 0 indicates that a higher expected
IV is associated with higher bids, consistent with the view that the expresslane option is more valuable when arbitrage intensity rises. Conversely, _θ_ 2 _<_ 0
on the standardized variance of the IV implies a risk discount: greater forecast
uncertainty lowers valuations. Estimated tail parameters ( _ν ≈_ 1 _._ 2–1 _._ 7) confirm
heavy-tailed residuals, justifying the Student- _t_ specification. Figures 2 and 3
provide comprehensive visualization of our result.
Interestingly, the log-log variant of the reduced and full models yielded better
results, although it lacks a theoretical justification. This may be due to the
aforementioned scaling issues with the independent variables. The magnitude of

to 10 _[−]_ [12], respectively, and residuals on the samples with large estimated IV
moments dominate in the process of MLE. See Table 2.

heteroskedastic tobit regression was done for each subsample. For visibility, the
figure is in log scale.


_Robustness._ We assess the robustness of the estimated relationships across different market conditions. To this end, we partition the dataset along both the
temporal and regime dimensions. Specifically, the full sample is divided into (i)
monthly subsamples from May through October and (ii) two volatility regimes
(low and high, with median as threshold) delineated by the cross-sectional median of volatility. The regression model is then re-estimated separately for each
subsample, and the corresponding estimates are reported in Table 3.
Although the magnitude of the estimated coefficients varies across subsamples, the sign pattern is preserved: the coefficient on the variance of variance
remains negative (interpreted as a discount) in all cases. A notable exception
arises in the low-volatility regime, where the estimate of the coefficient on _θ_ 2 is
disproportionately large. While we do not have a definitive explanation for this
outcome, we conjecture that it is attributable to a scaling issue. In particular,
Var(IV)� is approximately of the same order of magnitude as E [�] [IV]2, with its
minimum value on the order of 10 _[−]_ [22], and such extreme scaling potentially lead
to estimation bias and numerical instability in some cases.
To further verify our hypothesis without relying on the rational-expectations,
i.e., the on-average correct forecasts assumption, we also ran a regression using
lagged IV moment estimators, the estimated mean and variance of IV from the
previous round, which are available to bidders at the time of bidding. For the
result, see Tables 4 and 5. We found that not only does the discount remain
persistent, but the overall goodness of fit also improves significantly for both
linear and log-transformed models, suggesting the possibility of bidders relying

on a simple AR(1) model instead of trying to precisely forecast the volatility
distribution.


**3.4** **Discussion**


The empirical findings reveal a statistically significant discount attributed to
the inherent uncertainty (i.e., risk) associated with forecasting future volatility
and the generated arbitrage revenue. This suggests that the efficiency of the
ELA may diminish during periods of high market turbulence, not just because
volatility is high, but because it becomes less predictable. This discount leads
to lower bids relative to bidders’ expected value of CEX-DEX arbitrage profit
and, consequently, to a lower MEV capture rate. Further refinement of the ELA
mechanism is required to mitigate this observed inefficiency.
Given the challenges of accurately forecasting short-term volatility due to
its low signal-to-noise ratio and non-stationarity, extending the round length to
a longer duration, such as hourly or even daily, may be a more robust design.
While longer horizons introduce other challenges, such as increased capital requirements, they may filter high-frequency noise and improve the signal-to-noise
ratio of volatility forecasts. We also note that, instead of a seemingly arbitrary
0 _._ 001 ETH, the reserve price should be set strategically to maximize expected
revenue, balancing the guaranteed lower bound on payment with the probability
of failing to attract any bidders.
Alternatively, a subscription-based model could be considered for simultaneously offering the express lane to multiple market participants. This approach
has established precedents within traditional financial (TradFi) exchanges [8],
and recently launched perpetual exchanges such as Lighter and Paradex are
adopting it as well [10] .


_Limitations._ Although the data support our hypotheses, our model has several
limitations. Firstly, our model presents an oversimplified representation. Factors
such as Total Value Locked (TVL) and liquidity near the current price significantly influence bidders’ revenue; however, these elements are not incorporated
into our model, which may introduce bias into our estimations. Secondly, data
noise poses a challenge. Binance candles, generated from the last traded price,
are susceptible to sudden price spikes from large market orders, thereby becoming decoupled from the true price. The use of future values as a proxy for the
forecast also causes attenuation bias. We also remark that a significant portion
of rounds being censored in samples and subsamples further weakens our claims,
too.


**4** **Conclusion**


In this study, we hypothesized that Timeboost exhibits a lower MEV capture
rate under volatile market conditions and empirically tested this hypothesis. Our

methodology uses realized values to construct a noisy proxy for an unobserved
variable that captures bidders’ forecasts of future volatility. We developed a
bidder valuation model and proposed using the coefficient on the variance of
integrated variance (Var(IV)) as the risk premium for the uncertainty in the value
of access to the express lane (EL). Subsequently, we compared the regression
results of our model with those of a baseline model that excluded a risk premium,
demonstrating improvements in fit and a reduction in downward bias in the
restricted model. We further tested our hypothesis under various conditions to
check the robustness of the results.


This study shows that variance risk premiums are statistically significant
and negative. Specifically, it demonstrates that the full model provides a better
explanation of the findings compared to the restricted model. As expected, the
restricted model yields a downward-biased slope relative to the full model, reinforcing the overall argument. We further tested our hypothesis under various
conditions, checking the results with subsamples, using alternative measures of
volatility, dropping the rational-expectations assumption, and using forecasted
rather than realized values to assess robustness.


Based on the results, we provided an outline to improve the current Timeboost auction implementation and increase the sequencer’s revenue. Specifically,
we offered two suggestions: a more advanced method for setting the reserve
price and extending the round length, which helps bidders better estimate future (averaged) volatility, leading to less discounting. We also briefly mentioned
the option of switching to a subscription model, which is already popular in
traditional finance (TradFi).


Our methodology exhibits several notable limitations. Primarily, the model’s
simplicity results in the omission of numerous real-world complexities. For example, the model assumes that the liquidity available around the CEX price remains
constant throughout the analysis period and restricts its scope to ETH as the
only volatile asset within AMMs. Furthermore, reliance on the CIPV framework
may not fully capture the intricacies of actual market dynamics. The use of
future realized variance and Newey-West estimators, which are inherently unknown at the time of bidding, as noisy proxies for bidders’ forecasts, introduces
attenuation bias. Finally, the substantial rate of data censorship poses significant
challenges to the robustness and validity of the inferences drawn, despite the use
of tobit regression.


Despite of aforementioned limitations, this study is one of the first empirical
investigations of Timeboost, examining the determinants of bidders’ valuations
and the efficacy of the express lane auctions. As such, it provides a foundational
reference for subsequent research that employs more advanced methodologies
and incorporates realistic assumptions. Ultimately, this study aims to enhance
the understanding of time-based sequencing mechanisms within auction frameworks.
