**Abstract**


This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption


in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities,


and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through


a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as ex

pected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial

network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification


Factor—a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio


of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock.


A L´evy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures


critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual dif

fusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete


jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global


Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime char

acterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 69,

## **1 Introduction**

Technology adoption in networked markets exhibits distinctive dynamics that stan

dard models struggle to capture. When the value of a technology depends on


how many others have adopted—the defining feature of network externalities—


coordination failures can trap markets in inefficient equilibria even when superior


technologies are available. The transition from legacy payment systems to modern


financial technology illustrates these dynamics vividly: banks benefit from new pay

ment platforms only if their counterparties also adopt, and counterparties invest in


integration only if enough banks participate. This coordination problem can sustain


a low-adoption equilibrium indefinitely, even when all parties would prefer universal


adoption.


Recent empirical work has documented both the importance of coordination fric

tions and the potential for policy to overcome them. Crouzet et al. (2023) show that


India’s demonetization—a large but temporary shock to cash availability—produced


persistent increases in digital wallet adoption, with complementarities accounting for


45 percent of the adoption response. Higgins (2024) demonstrates that government


distribution of debit cards to poor households in Mexico triggered supply-side adop

tion of point-of-sale terminals, which then spilled over to increase other consumers’


card adoption by 21 percent. These findings confirm that coordination failures con

strain technology diffusion and that coordinated shocks can shift economies to supe

rior equilibria.


This paper develops a unified framework that captures three distinct channels


of technology spillovers in financial networks: spatial spillovers reflecting geographic


clustering of adopters, network spillovers reflecting adoption by business partners


and counterparties, and the interaction between these channels that arises when geo

graphic neighbors are also network-connected. Existing studies of network externali

ties focus exclusively on network linkages, neglecting spatial spillovers that arise from


geographic proximity. However, financial institutions form business relationships dis

3


proportionately with geographic neighbors due to information advantages, regulatory


similarities, and historical ties. The spatial-network interaction—absent from existing


models—captures amplification when both channels operate simultaneously, which is


empirically important in financial technology settings. The framework contributes to


understanding the externality structure of financial networks in three ways. First,


the Adoption Amplification Factor quantifies externalities by measuring how much a


shock at one institution affects the entire system beyond the direct effect. Second,


the channel decomposition reveals whether externalities flow primarily through net

work linkages, geographic proximity, or their interaction. Third, the Feynman-Kac


representation provides a path-based interpretation: externalities propagate along


all possible paths of economic linkage, weighted by probability and discounted by


adjustment frictions.


A central methodological contribution is extending the baseline diffusion frame

work to incorporate L´evy jump-diffusion dynamics with state-dependent intensity.


The baseline continuous model describes gradual adoption transmission appropriate


for the pre-critical-mass regime, where institutions learn from neighbors and incre

mentally adjust adoption decisions. However, technology adoption often exhibits sud

den cascades once critical mass is reached—adoption spreads rapidly through positive


feedback as network effects dominate individual cost-benefit calculations. The L´evy


extension captures these dynamics by adding a jump operator _J_ [ _τ_ ] whose intensity


depends on the current adoption level: _λJ_ ( _τ_ ) = _λ_ 0 + ( _λ_ 1 _−_ _λ_ 0) _· H_ ( _τ −_ _τ_ ¯ _[∗]_ ), where


_H_ ( _·_ ) is the Heaviside function and ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ is the critical mass threshold. Below threshold,


jumps are rare ( _λJ ≈_ _λ_ 0) and diffusion dominates; above threshold, jump intensity


increases to _λ_ 1 _≫_ _λ_ 0, generating rapid cascades. In the limit _λ_ 0 _→_ 0 and _λ_ 1 _→∞_,


the framework converges to deterministic cascade models, clarifying that continuous


and discrete approaches describe different regimes of the same phenomenon. This


nesting relationship unifies the gradual diffusion models of Guimaraes et al. (2020)


with the tipping point dynamics emphasized in Katz and Shapiro (1985) and Arthur


4


(1989).


The theoretical contribution centers on demonstrating that the continuous spatial

network framework nests several canonical models from the technology adoption


and dynamic coordination literatures as special cases through explicit discretiza

tion. The Katz-Shapiro model of network externalities and compatibility corre

sponds to the discrete network steady state, with the externality function identified as


_v_ ( _ni_ ) = _νn_ - _j_ _[G][ij][τ][j][/κ]_ [. The Frankel-Pauzner model of dynamic coordination, which]


shows how aggregate shocks can resolve multiple equilibria, emerges when spatial and


network dimensions collapse to a single aggregate state, with strategic complementar

ity parameter ( _νs_ + _νn_ ) _/κ_ . The Guimaraes-Machado-Pereira framework of dynamic


coordination with timing frictions maps directly to the decay parameter: their Pois

son arrival rate of revision opportunities _λ_ equals the adjustment rate _κ_ in the master


equation. Standard technology adoption hazard models correspond to the case where


diffusion coefficients are zero ( _νs_ = _νn_ = 0). These nesting relationships, established


through the discrete Feynman-Kac formula, demonstrate that the framework is not


an exotic alternative but a unification that reveals the common structure underlying


conventional methods.


The framework yields several insights for technology policy in financial systems.


The Adoption Amplification Factor identifies technology leaders whose adoption de

cisions have outsized influence on system-wide outcomes. Targeting subsidies or pi

lot programs at high-amplification institutions maximizes spillovers per dollar spent.


The channel decomposition reveals whether adoption spreads primarily through ge

ographic proximity, business relationships, or their interaction, informing whether


policy should target geographic clusters, network hubs, or institutions that are cen

tral on both dimensions. The critical mass analysis provides guidance on interven

tion size: temporary interventions must push adoption above threshold to produce


permanent effects, and the L´evy extension characterizes the threshold condition as

- _T_
0 _[I]_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _[ · A]_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _[ ds >]_ [ ¯] _[τ][ ∗]_ _[−]_ _[τ]_ [¯][0][, where cumulative amplified intervention effects must]


5


exceed the gap between initial adoption and critical mass.


I apply the framework to study SWIFT gpi adoption among Global Systemically


Important Banks in 2017. SWIFT gpi represents a major technological upgrade to


interbank payment messaging, offering same-day settlement, end-to-end tracking, and


confirmation of credit to beneficiary accounts. The adoption pattern provides a natu

ral test of the framework’s predictions: banks with higher amplification factors—those


more central in the combined spatial-network structure—should be earlier adopters.


The empirical analysis confirms this prediction strongly ( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 69, _p_ = 0 _._ 002), with


network-central banks adopting significantly earlier than peripheral banks. Founding


members, representing 29 percent of banks in the sample, account for 39 percent of


total system amplification, confirming that high-amplification institutions lead adop

tion. The two-regime dynamics predicted by the L´evy extension are evident in the


data: pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post

threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, _p_ = 0 _._ 010), and the cumulative adoption curve


exhibits classic S-curve dynamics. Controlling for network position reveals the role


of firm-level characteristics: CEO age delays adoption by 11–15 days per year condi

tional on firm size and network centrality.


The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the theoretical framework, be

ginning with the coordinate system and adoption representation, deriving the master


equation from three independent economic foundations (heterogeneous agent aggre

gation, market equilibrium, and cost minimization), presenting the complete master


equation with spatial-network interaction, establishing the Feynman-Kac representa

tion and its discrete analog, deriving the Adoption Amplification Factor, demonstrat

ing connections to conventional models through explicit mathematical identification,


and extending to L´evy jump-diffusion with state-dependent intensity to capture crit

ical mass dynamics. Section 3 presents Monte Carlo evidence validating the ampli

fication factor as a predictor of technology leadership and demonstrating threshold


dynamics. Section 4 applies the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among Global


6


Systemically Important Banks, presenting the empirical specification, regression re

sults, and evidence for two-regime dynamics. Section 5 concludes.

### **1.1 Related Literature**


This paper connects to several strands of literature on technology adoption, network


externalities, and dynamic coordination.


The foundational analysis of network externalities begins with Katz and Shapiro


(1985), who distinguish direct network effects from indirect network effects arising in


two-sided markets. Katz and Shapiro (1986) analyze technology adoption in the pres

ence of network externalities, showing that the market may fail to adopt a superior


technology due to coordination failure. Farrell and Saloner (1985) study standard

ization when firms have private information about technology value. The subsequent


literature has explored path dependence and lock-in (Arthur, 1989; David, 1985),


with Liebowitz and Margolis (1994) and Guimaraes and Pereira (2016) providing


important qualifications about when lock-in to inferior technologies actually occurs.


The theoretical foundations for equilibrium selection in coordination games de

velop in two related traditions. The global games approach, pioneered by Carlsson


and Van Damme (1993) and extended by Morris and Shin (1998, 2003) and Frankel


et al. (2003), uses private information to select among equilibria. The dynamic ap

proach, developed by Frankel and Pauzner (2000) and Burdzy et al. (2001), introduces


aggregate shocks that move the game through dominance regions. Guimaraes et al.


(2020) develop a general framework for dynamic coordination with timing frictions:


agents receive Poisson opportunities to revise their actions, with the revision rate


determining how quickly the economy adjusts to changing fundamentals. This paper


shows that the timing friction in Guimaraes et al. (2020) corresponds precisely to the


decay parameter _κ_ in the master equation, with the discrete Feynman-Kac formula


providing the explicit mathematical bridge.


The application to financial technology connects to a growing literature on fin

7


tech adoption and banking networks. Buchak et al. (2018) document the growth


of fintech lending, while Fuster et al. (2019) study technology’s effect on mortgage


lending. The network dimension links to the financial contagion literature: Allen


and Gale (2000) and Freixas et al. (2000) develop foundational contagion models,


while Acemoglu et al. (2015) characterize how network structure determines whether


connections facilitate risk sharing or amplify shocks. The framework developed here


shares the Feynman-Kac foundation and L´evy extension structure with recent work on


financial contagion (Kikuchi, 2025), but analyzes positive externalities—technology


adoption that benefits counterparties—rather than negative externalities arising from


stress transmission. This parallel structure suggests that the same network positions


that make institutions systemically important for crisis propagation also make them


technology leaders whose adoption decisions cascade broadly through the financial


system.

## **2 Theoretical Framework**


This section develops the theoretical framework in five stages. I first present the co

ordinate system and adoption representation. I then derive the master equation from


three independent economic foundations—heterogeneous agent aggregation, market


equilibrium, and cost minimization—establishing that the framework rests on funda

mental principles rather than ad hoc specifications. Third, I present the Feynman-Kac


representation and its discrete analog. Fourth, I develop the Adoption Amplifica

tion Factor. Finally, I demonstrate through explicit mathematical identification how


canonical models emerge as special cases.

### **2.1 Coordinate System and Adoption Representation**


We represent financial institutions by coordinates ( **x** _, α_ ) where **x** _∈_ Ω _⊆_ R _[d]_ denotes


spatial location and _α ∈N ⊆_ R denotes position in the network of business relation

8


ships. The adoption functional _τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) : Ω _× N ×_ [0 _, T_ ] _→_ R represents adoption


intensity at each point in this coordinate space.


**Definition 2.1** (Spatial and Network Coordinates) **.** _The spatial coordinate_ **x** _repre-_


_sents geographic location—latitude, longitude, and potentially economic distance met-_


_rics reflecting transportation costs or communication frictions._


_The network position coordinate α represents position in economic networks—_


_centrality in correspondent banking relationships, position in payment flows, or role_


_in interbank lending markets._


The continuous representation avoids three limitations of discrete methods. First,


it avoids arbitrary discretization of adoption intensity into binary indicators, preserv

ing the dose-response relationship central to technology diffusion. Second, it avoids


arbitrary spatial boundaries between regions, allowing smooth geographic variation in


adoption patterns. Third, it avoids discrete network categories, enabling continuous


market position that captures fine gradations in institutional relationships.


**Definition 2.2** (Source Term) **.** _The source term S_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) _represents exogenous adop-_


_tion shocks entering the system. In technology adoption contexts, S measures the in-_


_tensity of direct adoption incentives at each location-network-time cell, arising from_


_regulatory mandates, technological breakthroughs, or coordinated industry initiatives._


The distinction between source _S_ and adoption functional _τ_ is fundamental. The


source represents direct, exogenous adoption pressure; the adoption functional rep

resents the equilibrium response incorporating both direct effects and all spillovers


through spatial and network channels.

### **2.2 Derivation from Heterogeneous Agent Aggregation**


The first derivation proceeds from aggregating heterogeneous agent behavior, follow

ing the tradition of Aiyagari (1994) and Huggett (1993) in macroeconomics.


9


Consider a continuum of heterogeneous institutions indexed by type _θ ∈_ Θ


distributed over space and network positions. Each institution has idiosyncratic


characteristics—size, risk appetite, technological capacity—captured by _θ_ . Institu

tion _i_ of type _θ_ at location **x** with network position _α_ experiences adoption intensity:


_τi_ ( **x** _, α, t, θ_ ) = _τ_ 0( **x** _, α_ ) + _τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) + _εi_ ( _θ_ ) (1)


where _τ_ 0 is baseline adoption, _τ_ is the aggregate adoption effect to be determined,


and _εi_ ( _θ_ ) captures idiosyncratic variation.


Institutions optimize location and network position subject to adjustment costs.


The state of institution _i_ evolves according to the stochastic differential equations:


_dXt_ _[i]_ [=] _[ µ][s]_ [(] _[X]_ _t_ _[i][, A][i]_ _t_ _[, θ][i]_ [)] _[ dt]_ [ +] _[ σ][s]_ [(] _[X]_ _t_ _[i][, A][i]_ _t_ _[, θ][i]_ [)] _[ dB]_ _t_ _[s]_ (2)


_dA_ _[i]_ _t_ [=] _[ µ][n]_ [(] _[X]_ _t_ _[i][, A][i]_ _t_ _[, θ][i]_ [)] _[ dt]_ [ +] _[ σ][n]_ [(] _[X]_ _t_ _[i][, A][i]_ _t_ _[, θ][i]_ [)] _[ dB]_ _t_ _[n]_ (3)


where ( _Bt_ _[s][, B]_ _t_ _[n]_ [) are independent Brownian motions representing location and network]


uncertainty. The drift terms _µs, µn_ capture directed adjustments—institutions mov

ing toward more favorable positions. The diffusion terms _σs, σn_ capture randomness in


adjustment outcomes—search frictions, information imperfections, and relationship


formation uncertainty.


The joint density _f_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) of institutions over spatial and network coordinates


evolves according to the Kolmogorov forward equation:



_∂f_

_∂t_ [=] _[ −∇·]_ [ (] _**[µ]**_ _[s][f]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[∂]_

_∂α_ [2] [(] _[σ]_ [2]



_∂f_




_[∂]_

_∂α_ [(] _[µ][n][f]_ [) + ][1] 2



This equation describes how the population distribution shifts as institutions re

locate and adjust network positions.


**Proposition 2.1** (Aggregation Result) **.** _Under the following regularity conditions:_


_(i) bounded heterogeneity:_ sup _θ ∥σ_ ( _·, θ_ ) _∥_ _< ∞; (ii) ergodic dynamics: the process_


10


( _Xt, At_ ) _has a unique stationary distribution for each θ; (iii) smooth aggregation: the_


_mapping θ �→_ _τ_ ( _·, θ_ ) _is measurable; the aggregate adoption functional satisfies:_


_∂τ_ _∂_ [2] _τ_

_[−]_ _[κτ]_ [ +] _[ S]_ [(] **[x]** _[, α, t]_ [)] (5)
_∂t_ [=] _[ ν][s][∇]_ [2] _[τ]_ [ +] _[ ν][n]_ _∂α_ [2]



_where νs_ = [1]




[1] 2 [E] _[θ]_ [[] _[σ]_ _s_ [2][(] _[θ]_ [)]] _[ is mean spatial diffusivity,][ ν][n]_ [=] 2 [1]



2 [1] [E] _[θ]_ [[] _[σ]_ _n_ [2][(] _[θ]_ [)]] _[ is mean network]_



_diffusivity, and κ reflects mean reversion from competitive pressure._


The aggregation result shows that heterogeneous institution behavior generates


aggregate dynamics governed by a partial differential equation. The diffusion coeffi

cients ( _νs, νn_ ) emerge from averaging individual mobility variances across types; they


measure how quickly adoption spreads through the population as institutions adjust


positions and form new relationships.

### **2.3 Derivation from Market Equilibrium**


An independent derivation proceeds from market equilibrium conditions, connecting


observed adoption volatility to underlying market structure.


In markets with search frictions, matching delays, or information asymmetries,


adoption rates fluctuate around equilibrium values. The observed volatility _σ_ [2] of


adoption processes relates to underlying market adjustment through the equilibrium


volatility relation:


_σ_ [2] = 2 _Dκ_ (6)


where _D_ is a diffusion coefficient measuring the amplitude of fluctuations and _κ_ is


the adjustment rate toward equilibrium.


This relation emerges from the stochastic process governing adoption dynamics:


_dτ_ = _−κ_ ( _τ −_ _τ_ _[∗]_ ) _dt_ + _σ dB_ (7)


where _τ_ _[∗]_ is equilibrium adoption and _κ_ governs mean reversion speed. At stationarity,


11


variance satisfies Var( _τ_ ) = _σ_ [2] _/_ (2 _κ_ ), which rearranges to (6).


Connecting observed dynamics to adoption propagation: spatial adoption volatil

ity _σs_ [2] [implies spatial diffusion] _[ ν][s]_ [=] _[ σ]_ _s_ [2] _[/]_ [(2] _[κ]_ [); network adoption volatility] _[ σ]_ _n_ [2] [implies]

network diffusion _νn_ = _σn_ [2] _[/]_ [(2] _[κ]_ [). Markets with high adoption volatility—active ex-]


perimentation, frequent technology updates—exhibit rapid spatial diffusion; markets


with stable adoption patterns exhibit slow diffusion.

### **2.4 Derivation from Cost Minimization**


A third derivation proceeds from cost minimization, following variational principles


underlying market equilibrium.


**Definition 2.3** (Adjustment Cost Functional) **.** _The total adjustment cost functional_


_is:_




- _∂τ_


_∂t_

_C_ [ _τ_ ] =

The terms have economic interpretations in the technology adoption context. The


term [1]

2 [(] _[∂τ/∂t]_ [)][2][ captures temporal adjustment costs: rapidly changing adoption is]


costly due to integration frictions, training requirements, and coordination failures.


The term _[ν][s]_

2 _[|∇][τ]_ _[|]_ [2][ captures spatial gradient costs: maintaining adoption differentials]


across space is costly due to competitive pressure from neighboring institutions. The


term _[ν][n]_

2 [(] _[∂τ/∂α]_ [)][2][ captures network gradient costs: maintaining adoption differentials]


across network positions is costly due to interoperability pressure from counterparties.


The term _[κ]_

2 _[τ]_ [ 2][ captures level costs: deviating from baseline technology is costly due]


to switching costs and legacy system maintenance. The term _−Sτ_ captures policy


benefits: the intervention _S_ shifts optimal adoption.


**Proposition 2.2** (Euler-Lagrange Equation) **.** _The adoption functional τ_ _[∗]_ _minimizing_


_C_ [ _τ_ ] _satisfies:_
_∂τ_ _∂_ [2] _τ_

_[−]_ _[κτ]_ [ +] _[ S]_ (9)
_∂t_ [=] _[ ν][s][∇]_ [2] _[τ]_ [ +] _[ ν][n]_ _∂α_ [2]


12


_Proof._ The first variation of _C_ with respect to _τ_ must vanish for all admissible varia

tions _η_ :

_∂t_ [2] _∂α_ [2]



For quasi-static evolution where _∂_ [2] _τ/∂t_ [2] _≈_ 0, this yields the master equation.


The cost minimization derivation connects the master equation to optimization


principles. The parameters ( _νs, νn, κ_ ) have natural interpretations as relative costs:


high _νs_ means spatial arbitrage is rapid (low cost of spatial gradients); high _κ_ means


competitive pressure is strong (high cost of deviating from baseline technology).

### **2.5 The Complete Master Equation with Interaction**


The three derivations above establish the basic master equation without spatial

network interaction. The complete specification adds the interaction term capturing


amplification when geographic and network proximity coincide.


**Definition 2.4** (Master Equation) **.** _The adoption field τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) _evolves according to:_



_∂τ_ _∂_ [2] _τ_ _[∂]_ [2] _[τ]_

[+] _[ λ]_
_∂t_ [=] _[ ν][s][∇]_ [2] _[τ]_ [ +] _[ ν][n]_ _∂α_ [2] _∂_ **x**



_∂τ_



(12)
_∂_ **x** _∂α_ _[−]_ _[κτ]_ [ +] _[ S]_ [(] **[x]** _[, α, t]_ [)]



_where νs ≥_ 0 _is spatial diffusion, νn ≥_ 0 _is network diffusion, λ is spatial-network_


_interaction, κ >_ 0 _is adjustment speed, and S is the exogenous adoption shock._


The interaction term _λ∂_ [2] _τ/∂_ **x** _∂α_ captures amplification when institutions are


proximate on both dimensions. In financial networks, institutions form business re

lationships disproportionately with geographic neighbors due to information advan

13


tages, regulatory similarities, and historical ties. When a geographic neighbor is also


a network partner, adoption influence compounds: the neighbor’s adoption affects the


focal institution through both demonstration effects (spatial channel) and interoper

ability benefits (network channel), with the interaction term capturing reinforcement


beyond the sum of separate effects.


**Remark 2.1** (Parameter Interpretation for Technology Adoption) **.** _The parameters_


_have structural interpretations in the adoption context:_


_The spatial diffusion coefficient νs measures geographic adoption spillovers reflect-_


_ing local demonstration effects, labor mobility spreading technological knowledge, and_


_regional market integration creating competitive pressure to adopt._


_The network diffusion coefficient νn measures adoption spillovers through business_


_relationships reflecting interoperability benefits when counterparties adopt, learning_


_from network partners’ experiences, and coordination incentives in bilateral transac-_


_tions._


_The interaction coefficient λ captures amplification when both channels coincide,_


_common in financial markets where correspondent banks, payment network partners,_


_and syndicate members are often geographic neighbors._


_The adjustment parameter κ measures how rapidly institutions respond to adoption_


_incentives, corresponding to the timing friction in Guimaraes et al. (2020): higher_


_κ implies faster adjustment and shorter waiting times until adoption decisions are_


_revised._

### **2.6 Feynman-Kac Representation and Discrete Analog**


The master equation admits a probabilistic solution that provides both computational


methods and economic intuition.


**Theorem 2.1** (Feynman-Kac Representation) **.** _The solution to the master equation_


14


_(12) admits the representation:_



_τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) = E( **x** _,α_ )




- - _t_ _e_ _[−][κt]_ _τ_ 0( _Xt, At_ ) + _e_ _[−][κ]_ [(] _[t][−][s]_ [)] _S_ ( _Xs, As, s_ ) _ds_ (13)

0



_where_ ( _Xs, As_ ) _s≥_ 0 _is the diffusion process with generator L_ = _νs∇_ [2] + _νn∂_ [2] _/∂α_ [2] +


_λ∂_ [2] _/∂_ **x** _∂α started at_ ( _X_ 0 _, A_ 0) = ( **x** _, α_ ) _._


_Proof._ Define the transformed function _u_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) = _e_ _[κt]_ _τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ). Substituting into the


master equation yields _∂u/∂t_ = _Lu_ + _e_ _[κt]_ _S_ . By the standard Feynman-Kac formula


for parabolic PDEs:



_u_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) = E( **x** _,α_ )




- - _t_ _u_ 0( _Xt, At_ ) + _e_ _[κs]_ _S_ ( _Xs, As, s_ ) _ds_ (14)

0



Substituting _u_ = _e_ _[κt]_ _τ_ and rearranging yields (13).


The representation has direct economic content: adoption intensity equals the ex

pected cumulative exposure to adoption shocks along all paths of economic linkage,


discounted at rate _κ_ . Institutions in densely connected network regions or geographi

cally central locations receive contributions from more paths, elevating their adoption


intensity even without direct shocks.


**Proposition 2.3** (Discrete Feynman-Kac Formula) **.** _For discrete time periods t_ =


0 _,_ 1 _, . . ., T and discrete units i_ = 1 _, . . ., N_ _, the Feynman-Kac representation admits_


_the discrete analog:_



_τi,t_ =



_t−_ 1


(1 _−_ _κ_ ∆ _t_ ) _[t][−][s]_ _·_ E[ _Si_ ( _s_ ) _,s|i_ ( _t_ ) = _i_ ] _·_ ∆ _t_ (15)

_s_ =0



_where i_ ( _s_ ) _traces a stochastic path backward through the network from unit i at time_


_t to earlier times, and_ (1 _−_ _κ_ ∆ _t_ ) _[t][−][s]_ _are exponentially decaying weights._


This discrete formula provides the bridge to conventional econometric methods


and enables the nesting relationships developed below.

### **2.7 Adoption Amplification Factor**

The Feynman-Kac representation motivates a natural measure of technology leader

ship.


**Definition 2.5** (Adoption Amplification Factor) **.** _For an institution at location_


( **x** _i, αi_ ) _, the Adoption Amplification Factor is:_




 _X_ _N_ _[τ]_ [(] **[x]** _[, α, t]_ [)] _[ dα d]_ **[x]** _[ dt]_

~~�~~ ~~_∞_~~ (16)
0 _[τ]_ [(] **[x]** _[i][, α][i][, t]_ [)] _[ dt]_



_Ai_ =




- _∞_ 0



_measuring the ratio of total system-wide adoption to direct adoption at institution i_


_following a localized shock at i._


An amplification factor of _Ai_ = 10 means that total system-wide adoption follow

ing a shock at institution _i_ is ten times larger than direct adoption at _i_ alone—the


remaining nine-tenths represent spillovers along paths of economic linkage through


space and network.


**Proposition 2.4** (Channel Decomposition) **.** _The Adoption Amplification Factor de-_


_composes as:_


_Ai_ = 1 + _A_ _[spatial]_ _i_ + _A_ _[network]_ _i_ + _A_ _[interaction]_ _i_ (17)


_where A_ _[spatial]_ _i_ _captures spillovers through geographic proximity, A_ _[network]_ _i_ _captures_


_spillovers through business relationships, and A_ _[interaction]_ _i_ _captures amplification from_


_coincident proximity._


This decomposition reveals which transmission channel contributes most to each


institution’s role as a technology leader, informing targeted policy interventions.

### **2.8 Connection to Conventional Models**


The master equation framework nests several canonical models as special cases. This


section establishes these connections through explicit mathematical identification.


16


**Katz-Shapiro Network Externalities.** Katz and Shapiro (1985) model network


externalities through the utility function _ui_ = _v_ ( _n_ ) _−_ _p_ where _v_ ( _n_ ) is the value of


adoption when _n_ others have adopted, with _v_ _[′]_ ( _n_ ) _>_ 0 capturing the positive exter

nality.


**Proposition 2.5** (Katz-Shapiro as Discrete Network Steady State) **.** _At steady state_


_(∂τ/∂t_ = 0 _) with discrete network structure and no spatial diffusion (νs_ = 0 _), the_


_master equation yields:_


      _κτi_ = _νn_ _Gij_ ( _τj −_ _τi_ ) + _Si_ (18)


_j_


_Rearranging gives:_







1
_τi_ =
_κ_ + _νndi_





  _Si_ + _νn_ _Gijτj_


_j_



(19)



_where di_ = [�] _j_ _[G][ij][ is node degree. This corresponds to the Katz-Shapiro equilibrium]_

_with network externality v_ ( _ni_ ) = _νn_ - _j_ _[G][ij][τ][j][/κ][.]_


**Frankel-Pauzner Dynamic Coordination.** Frankel and Pauzner (2000) show


that when agents choose between two actions with payoffs depending on the fraction


choosing each action, and the payoff-relevant parameter follows Brownian motion, a


unique equilibrium emerges.


**Proposition 2.6** (Frankel-Pauzner as Aggregate Limit) **.** _When spatial and network_


_coordinates collapse to a single dimension, the master equation reduces to:_


_dτ_ ¯

(20)
_dt_ [=] _[ −][κ][τ]_ [¯][ + ¯] _[S]_ [(] _[t]_ [) +] _[ ν][ ·]_ [ ¯] _[τ]_


_where_ ¯ _τ is aggregate adoption,_ _S_ [¯] _is aggregate shock, and ν_ = _νs_ + _νn. This corresponds_


_to the Frankel-Pauzner dynamics with strategic complementarity parameter ν/κ._


**Guimaraes-Machado-Pereira Timing Frictions.** Guimaraes et al. (2020) de

velop a framework where agents receive Poisson opportunities to revise actions at


17


rate _λ_ . The state evolution satisfies:


_dn_

(21)
_dt_ [=] _[ λ][ ·]_ [ [] _[F]_ [(] _[θ, n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[n]_ []]


**Proposition 2.7** (Timing Friction Correspondence) **.** _The decay parameter κ in the_


_master equation corresponds exactly to the Poisson revision rate λ in Guimaraes et al._


_(2020):_


_κ_ = _λ_ (22)


_The discrete Feynman-Kac formula (15) with time step_ ∆ _t yields dynamics matching_


_Guimaraes-Machado-Pereira with λ_ = _κ._


This identification has important implications. The timing friction _λ_ _[−]_ [1] —the ex

pected waiting time until revision—equals _κ_ _[−]_ [1] in the master equation. The half-life


of adoption effects is _t_ 1 _/_ 2 = ln(2) _/κ_, independent of observation frequency.


**Adoption** **Hazard** **Models.** Standard duration models specify hazard rate


_h_ ( _t|Xi_ ) = _h_ 0( _t_ ) exp( _Xi_ _[′][β]_ [).]


**Proposition 2.8** (Hazard Models as No-Spillover Limit) **.** _When νs_ = _νn_ = 0 _, the_


_master equation implies:_
_dτi_

(23)
_dt_ [=] _[ −][κτ][i]_ [ +] _[ S][i]_ [(] _[t]_ [)]


_corresponding to independent adoption with hazard hi_ = _κ_ + _Si. The no-spillover case_


_is a testable restriction._


Table 1 summarizes these relationships.

and discretization. The full model generalizes all approaches.

### **2.9 L´evy Extension: Critical Mass and Cascade Dynamics**


The baseline framework describes continuous adoption transmission appropriate for


gradual diffusion regimes. To capture the sudden adoption cascades that occur when


critical mass is reached—where adoption spreads rapidly through positive feedback


rather than gradual diffusion—I extend the framework to incorporate jumps through


L´evy processes.


**Jump-Diffusion Dynamics.** The extended dynamics replace pure diffusion with


a jump-diffusion process:



_∂τ_ _∂_ [2] _τ_ _[∂]_ [2] _[τ]_

[+] _[ λ]_
_∂t_ [=] _[ ν][s][∇]_ [2] _[τ]_ [ +] _[ ν][n]_ _∂α_ [2] _∂_ **x**



_∂τ_



(24)
_∂_ **x** _∂α_ _[−]_ _[κτ]_ [ +] _[ S]_ [ +] _[ J]_ [ [] _[τ]_ []]



where the jump operator _J_ [ _τ_ ] captures sudden adoption events distinct from gradual


diffusion, defined by




_ν_ ( _dz_ ) (25)




   _J_ [ _τ_ ] =


R




_τ_ ( **x** _, α_ + _z, t_ ) _−_ _τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) _−_ _z_ _[∂τ]_

_∂α_ **[1]** _[|][z][|][<]_ [1]



Here _ν_ ( _dz_ ) is the L´evy measure characterizing jump intensity and size distribution.


The compensator term _z∂τ/∂α ·_ **1** _|z|<_ 1 ensures the integral is well-defined for L´evy


19


measures with infinite activity near zero.


In the technology adoption context, jumps represent sudden adoption events dis

tinct from gradual diffusion. When adoption reaches critical mass, network effects


trigger rapid cascades—institutions observe successful adoption by counterparties and


revise their own adoption decisions discretely rather than incrementally. The L´evy


measure _ν_ ( _dz_ ) captures both how frequently such cascade events occur (total mass


of _ν_ ) and the distribution of adoption spillover magnitudes when they occur (shape


of _ν_ ).


For a compound Poisson process with intensity _λJ_ and jump size distribution _F_,


the L´evy measure is _ν_ ( _dz_ ) = _λJ_ _dF_ ( _z_ ), and the jump operator simplifies to


     


_J_ [ _τ_ ] = _λJ_




[ _τ_ ( **x** _, α_ + _z, t_ ) _−_ _τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ )] _dF_ ( _z_ ) = _λJ_ (E[ _τ_ ( **x** _, α_ + _Z, t_ )] _−_ _τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ))

R

(26)



where _Z ∼_ _F_ represents the random jump size. This has intuitive interpretation: at


rate _λJ_, an institution’s adoption intensity jumps by an amount determined by the


cascade spillover from adopting counterparties at network distance _Z_ .


**State-Dependent Jump Intensity.** The key innovation capturing critical mass


dynamics makes jump intensity depend on the current adoption level:


_λJ_ ( _τ_ ) = _λ_ 0 + ( _λ_ 1 _−_ _λ_ 0) _· H_ ( _τ −_ _τ_ ¯ _[∗]_ ) (27)


where _H_ ( _·_ ) is the Heaviside function, ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ is the critical mass threshold, _λ_ 0 is baseline


jump intensity (gradual adoption regime), and _λ_ 1 _≫_ _λ_ 0 is elevated intensity above


threshold (cascade regime).


The state-dependent specification captures the central insight of the coordination


literature: below critical mass, adoption proceeds gradually as institutions weigh costs


and benefits individually; above critical mass, positive feedback accelerates adoption


as network effects dominate. The threshold ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ corresponds to the tipping point in


20


Arthur (1989) and the critical mass in Katz and Shapiro (1985).


**Proposition 2.9** (Cascade Limit) **.** _In the limit λ_ 0 _→_ 0 _and λ_ 1 _→∞, the dynamics_


_converge to deterministic cascade dynamics: below threshold, only diffusive transmis-_


_sion occurs; above threshold, immediate cascade with adoption spreading instanta-_


_neously to all connected institutions._


_Proof._ Consider the jump-diffusion dynamics with state-dependent intensity. For


_τ <_ ¯ ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_, _λJ_ ( _τ_ ) = _λ_ 0 _→_ 0, so the jump term vanishes and dynamics reduce to pure



diffusion:
_∂τ_



(28)
_∂_ **x** _∂α_ _[−]_ _[κτ]_ [ +] _[ S]_



_∂τ_ _∂_ [2] _τ_ _[∂]_ [2] _[τ]_

[+] _[ λ]_
_∂t_ [=] _[ ν][s][∇]_ [2] _[τ]_ [ +] _[ ν][n]_ _∂α_ [2] _∂_ **x**



For ¯ _τ ≥_ _τ_ ¯ _[∗]_, _λJ_ ( _τ_ ) = _λ_ 1 _→∞_ . In this limit, the jump term dominates and forces


instantaneous equilibration: _τ_ ( **x** _, α_ + _z, t_ ) = _τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) for all _z_ in the support of _F_,


implying uniform adoption across network-connected institutions. This is precisely


the cascade outcome where adoption spreads immediately upon crossing threshold.


This nesting relationship clarifies that continuous diffusion and discrete cascades


describe different regimes of the same phenomenon. Diffusion captures pre-critical

mass dynamics (gradual demonstration effects, incremental learning), while jumps


capture discrete adoption cascades when critical mass materializes. The framework


thus unifies the gradual diffusion models of Guimaraes et al. (2020) with the tipping


point dynamics emphasized in Katz and Shapiro (1985) and Arthur (1989).


**Feynman-Kac Representation with Jumps.** The Feynman-Kac representation


extends to the L´evy case by replacing the diffusion process with a jump-diffusion:


**Theorem 2.2** (L´evy-Feynman-Kac Representation) **.** _The solution to the L´evy-_


_extended master equation (24) admits the representation:_



_τ_ ( **x** _, α, t_ ) = E( **x** _,α_ )




- - _t_ _e_ _[−][κt]_ _τ_ 0( _Xt, At_ ) + _e_ _[−][κ]_ [(] _[t][−][s]_ [)] _S_ ( _Xs, As, s_ ) _ds_ (29)

0


21


_where_ ( _Xs, As_ ) _s≥_ 0 _is now a L´evy process combining diffusion with jumps governed by_


_measure ν_ ( _dz_ ) _._


The economic interpretation remains: adoption intensity equals expected cumula

tive exposure to adoption shocks along all paths through spatial-network space, but


paths now include both continuous diffusion and discrete jumps. The jump com

ponent captures cascade pathways where adoption spreads instantaneously through


network links when critical mass is reached.


**Temporary Interventions and Critical Mass.** The L´evy extension provides


rigorous foundations for analyzing when temporary interventions produce permanent


adoption shifts.


**Definition 2.6** (Intervention Intensity) **.** _The intervention intensity function I_ :


[0 _, T_ ] _→_ R+ _measures the rate at which the policy shock affects adoption at each_


_instant s ∈_ [0 _, T_ ] _:_




   _I_ ( _s_ ) =

_X_





_S_ ( **x** _, α, s_ ) _dα d_ **x** (30)
_N_



_representing spatially and network-integrated shock intensity at time s._


**Corollary 2.1** (Temporary Intervention Threshold) **.** _Consider a temporary interven-_


_tion of duration T with time-varying intensity I_ ( _s_ ) _as defined in Definition 2.6. Let_


_A_ ( _s_ ) _denote the time-varying system-wide amplification factor at time s. The inter-_


_vention produces permanent adoption gains if and only if cumulative amplified effects_


_exceed the critical mass gap:_


           - _T_

_I_ ( _s_ ) _· A_ ( _s_ ) _ds >_ ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ _−_ _τ_ ¯0 (31)
0


_where_ ¯ _τ_ 0 _is initial average adoption and the left-hand side represents cumulative am-_


_plified intervention effects._


_Proof._ Under the L´evy dynamics with state-dependent jump intensity (27), the sys

tem exhibits two stable regimes: a low-adoption equilibrium with ¯ _τ <_ ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ and a


22


high-adoption equilibrium with ¯ _τ >_ ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ . The intervention shifts average adoption by:


              - _T_
∆¯ _τ_ ( _T_ ) = _e_ _[−][κ]_ [(] _[T]_ _[−][s]_ [)] _I_ ( _s_ ) _· A_ ( _s_ ) _ds_ (32)

0


following from the Feynman-Kac representation integrated over space and network.


For permanent effects, the intervention must push adoption above threshold before


time _T_ : ¯ _τ_ 0 + ∆¯ _τ_ ( _T_ ) _>_ ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ . Rearranging and noting that _e_ _[−][κ]_ [(] _[T]_ _[−][s]_ [)] _≤_ 1 gives the


sufficient condition (31).


The condition has intuitive content: the cumulative intervention, weighted by the


amplification factor at each instant, must exceed the gap between initial adoption and


critical mass. Larger, more concentrated interventions are more likely to cross the


threshold than equivalent total resources spread thinly over time. This rationalizes


the findings in Crouzet et al. (2023) regarding India’s demonetization: the large but


temporary shock pushed digital wallet adoption above critical mass in high-exposure


regions, producing persistent increases even after cash availability normalized. In low

exposure regions, the shock fell short of the threshold, and adoption gains dissipated.


**Two-Regime Dynamics.** The L´evy extension generates qualitatively different dy

namics in the two regimes:


**Proposition 2.10** (Two-Regime Characterization) **.** _Under the state-dependent L´evy_


_dynamics:_


_(i) Below threshold (τ <_ ¯ ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ _): Adoption evolves through gradual diffusion with char-_


_acteristic time scale κ_ _[−]_ [1] _. The half-life of adoption responses is t_ 1 _/_ 2 = ln(2) _/κ,_


_and spatial-network spillovers spread at rates governed by νs and νn._


_(ii) Above threshold (τ_ ¯ _≥_ _τ_ ¯ _[∗]_ _): Jump intensity increases to λ_ 1 _, generating rapid cas-_

_cade dynamics. The characteristic time scale becomes λ_ _[−]_ 1 [1] _≪_ _κ_ _[−]_ [1] _, and adoption_


_spreads through discrete jumps rather than continuous diffusion._


23


_(iii) Transition dynamics: Near threshold, the system exhibits critical slowing—small_


_perturbations produce large, long-lasting responses as the system approaches the_


_bifurcation point._


This two-regime structure explains why technology adoption often exhibits S

curve dynamics: slow initial growth (below-threshold diffusion), rapid acceleration


(above-threshold cascade), and eventual saturation. The framework provides micro

foundations for this pattern through the state-dependent jump intensity mechanism.


**Remark 2.2** (Connection to Empirical Patterns) **.** _The L´evy extension rationalizes_


_several empirical patterns documented in the technology adoption literature. The sharp_


_contrast between gradual pre-threshold dynamics and rapid post-threshold cascades_


_matches the “hockey stick” adoption curves observed for successful technologies. The_


_critical slowing near threshold explains why adoption often appears to stall before sud-_


_denly accelerating. The permanent effects of sufficiently large temporary interventions_


_rationalize how coordinated industry initiatives or regulatory mandates can overcome_


_coordination failures that market forces alone cannot resolve._

## **3 Monte Carlo Evidence**


This section presents Monte Carlo simulations validating the theoretical predictions.

### **3.1 Simulation Design**


The simulations implement the discrete network formulation for networks of _N_ =


30 to 40 agents. I consider three network structures: random networks, scale-free


networks, and clustered networks where agents connect preferentially to geographic


neighbors. The baseline parameters are _νs_ = 0 _._ 5, _νn_ = 0 _._ 8, _λ_ = 0 _._ 3, _κ_ = 0 _._ 15, and


critical mass threshold ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ = 0 _._ 35.


24


### **3.2 Results**

Figure 1 illustrates the two-regime dynamics predicted by Proposition **??** . Panel (a)


compares adoption trajectories following small and large shocks. The small shock


targets 5 nodes (17 percent) while the large shock targets 18 nodes (60 percent).


Under the small shock, adoption rises during intervention but decays to 4.6 percent at


terminal date—the shock fails to cross critical mass. Under the large shock, adoption


crosses threshold and terminal adoption reaches 67.3 percent, nearly fifteen times


higher. Panel (b) shows the cross-sectional distribution: the large shock produces


bimodal adoption with mass near full adoption, while the small shock concentrates


near zero.


Figure 1: Critical Mass Dynamics


Notes: Panel (a) shows average adoption over time following small and large
shocks. The small shock fails to reach critical mass. The large shock crosses
threshold and triggers self-sustaining cascade. Panel (b) shows final adoption
distribution. Parameters: _N_ = 30, _νs_ = 0 _._ 8, _νn_ = 1 _._ 2, _λ_ = 0 _._ 4, _κ_ = 0 _._ 1,
_τ_ ¯ _[∗]_ = 0 _._ 35.


Figure 2 examines intervention duration effects as characterized in Corollary 2.1.


Short interventions ( _T_ = 1 _,_ 2) fail to cross threshold and produce terminal adoption of


only 1.6–1.8 percent. Longer interventions ( _T_ = 4 _,_ 7) succeed, with terminal adoption


of 37–45 percent. The sharp contrast illustrates threshold nonlinearity: resources


concentrated into interventions exceeding critical duration produce permanent shifts,


25


while equivalent resources spread below threshold have negligible permanent effects.


Figure 2: Effect of Intervention Duration on Adoption Dynamics


Notes: Short interventions ( _T_ = 1 _,_ 2) produce only temporary effects. Longer
interventions ( _T_ = 4 _,_ 7) cross critical mass and produce permanent shifts. Parameters: _N_ = 30, _νs_ = 0 _._ 5, _νn_ = 0 _._ 8, _λ_ = 0 _._ 3, _κ_ = 0 _._ 15, ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ = 0 _._ 35.


Figure 3 validates the Adoption Amplification Factor. Unit shocks are applied to


each node separately, and total adoption is measured at terminal date. The correlation


between simulated effects and theoretical amplification factors is 0.996 ( _p <_ 0 _._ 001),


confirming that the amplification factor accurately identifies technology leaders.


26


Figure 3: Validation of the Adoption Amplification Factor


Notes: Simulated total adoption effects plotted against theoretical amplification
factors. Correlation of 0.996 ( _p <_ 0 _._ 001) confirms that the amplification factor

_νn_ = 1 _._ 2, _λ_ = 0 _._ 4, _κ_ = 0 _._ 1.


Table 2 presents channel decomposition for the 15 highest-amplification nodes.


Network components dominate (reflecting _νn_ = 1 _._ 2 _> νs_ = 0 _._ 8), and interaction


terms are negative, indicating overlap between spatial and network centrality.

## **4 Empirical Application: SWIFT gpi Adoption**

### **4.1 Institutional Setting and Data**


SWIFT gpi (Global Payments Innovation) represents a major technological upgrade


to the interbank payment messaging system. Launched on February 1, 2017, gpi offers


same-day settlement, end-to-end tracking, and confirmation of credit to beneficiary


accounts. The technology exhibits strong network externalities: banks benefit only if


correspondent banks also adopt.


The sample consists of 17 Global Systemically Important Banks with complete


data on adoption timing, CEO characteristics, and network position. The dependent


variable is days from launch to adoption, ranging from 0 (founding members) to 305


days. The Amplification Factor is computed from the spatial-network framework


using BIS bilateral exposure data and geographic coordinates.


28


### **4.2 Empirical Specification**

The theoretical framework generates predictions about the relationship between net

work position, firm characteristics, and adoption timing. I estimate the following


specification:


Days _i_ = _β_ 0 + _β_ 1 _·_ CEO Age _i_ + _β_ 2 _· Ai_ + _β_ 3 _·_ log(Assets _i_ ) + _γ_ _[′]_ **R** _i_ + _εi_ (33)


where Days _i_ is the number of days from SWIFT gpi launch (February 1, 2017)


to bank _i_ ’s adoption date; CEO Age _i_ is the age of bank _i_ ’s CEO at the time of


the adoption decision; _Ai_ is the Adoption Amplification Factor measuring network


centrality; log(Assets _i_ ) is log total assets controlling for firm size; and **R** _i_ is a vector


of regional indicators (Europe, Asia-Pacific, with North America as baseline).


The theoretical predictions are: _β_ 2 _<_ 0 (network-central banks adopt earlier, re

flecting their higher returns from adoption due to larger spillovers); _β_ 3 _<_ 0 (larger


banks adopt earlier, reflecting greater resources and network effects); and _β_ 1 _>_ 0


(older CEOs adopt later, conditional on network position and size, reflecting technol

ogy hesitancy).

### **4.3 Results**


Figure 4 displays the relationship between Amplification Factor and adoption timing.


The correlation is strongly negative ( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 69, _p_ = 0 _._ 002): network-central banks


adopt significantly earlier. This pattern confirms the framework’s central prediction


that institutions with higher amplification factors—those whose adoption decisions


cascade most strongly through the system—are technology leaders who adopt first.


29


Figure 4: Amplification Factor and Adoption Timing


Notes: Scatter plot of Adoption Amplification Factor against days from SWIFT
gpi launch to adoption. The strong negative correlation ( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 69, _p_ = 0 _._ 002)
confirms that network-central banks adopt earlier. Colors indicate regions: blue
= North America, green = Europe, red = Asia-Pacific.


Table 3 presents regression results. Column (1) shows the baseline specification


without size controls: the amplification factor is negative and marginally significant


( _−_ 15 _._ 6 days per unit, _p_ = 0 _._ 07). Column (2) adds log assets, which is strongly


significant ( _−_ 195 days per log unit, _p <_ 0 _._ 01) and absorbs much of the amplification


effect. Crucially, the CEO age coefficient increases from 6.0 to 15.2 days per year


and becomes highly significant ( _p_ = 0 _._ 01) once size is controlled—firm size was a


confounding variable. Columns (3)–(4) add regional controls and CEO tenure; the


CEO age effect remains robust at 11–12 days per year.

Figure 5 presents the partial regression plot for CEO age, residualizing both the


dependent variable and CEO age on firm size and amplification factor. The positive


slope confirms that older CEOs adopt later conditional on network position and size.


31


Figure 5: Partial Regression: CEO Age Effect


Notes: Partial regression plot showing the relationship between CEO age and
adoption timing after controlling for log total assets and amplification factor.
Both variables are residualized on the controls. The positive slope indicates
that older CEOs adopt later, conditional on firm size and network centrality.


Figure 6 shows cumulative adoption over time. Five banks (29%) adopted at


launch as founding members, but these banks account for 42% of total system am

plification, confirming that the highest-amplification institutions led adoption. The


adoption curve for amplification-weighted adoption rises faster than the count-based


curve, indicating that network-central banks adopted disproportionately early.


32


Figure 6: Cumulative Adoption and Amplification


Notes: Cumulative adoption over time since SWIFT gpi launch. Solid line:

network-central banks adopted earlier.

### **4.4 Two-Regime Dynamics: Empirical Evidence**


The L´evy extension with state-dependent jump intensity (Proposition 2.10) predicts


qualitatively different adoption dynamics before and after critical mass is reached.


This subsection tests whether SWIFT gpi adoption exhibits the two-regime pattern:


gradual diffusion below threshold followed by accelerated cascade dynamics above


threshold.


I identify the critical mass threshold using the amplification-weighted adoption


measure. The founding members—Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Mitsubishi


UFJ, and BNP Paribas—adopted at launch (day 0). While these five banks represent


only 29 percent of the sample by count, they account for 39 percent of total system


amplification. Their simultaneous adoption created sufficient network externalities to


trigger cascade dynamics: subsequent banks could observe successful implementation


by major counterparties, reducing uncertainty and coordination costs.


33


Table 4 compares adoption patterns across three periods: pre-threshold (found

ing members), early post-threshold (days 1–100), and late post-threshold (days


101+). The results strongly support the two-regime characterization. Pre-threshold


adopters have significantly higher mean amplification factors (11.81) compared to


post-threshold adopters (7.82), with the difference statistically significant ( _t_ = 2 _._ 96,


_p_ = 0 _._ 010). This confirms the framework’s prediction that high-amplification


institutions—those whose adoption decisions cascade most strongly—adopt first,


pushing the system above critical mass.

_Notes:_ Pre-threshold adopters (founding members) have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters ( _t_ = 2 _._ 96, _p_ = 0 _._ 010). Within the
post-threshold period, amplification and adoption timing remain negatively correlated ( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 60, _p_ = 0 _._ 039).


Within the post-threshold period, the framework predicts continued negative cor

relation between amplification and adoption timing, as higher-amplification banks


benefit more from network externalities and thus adopt earlier even after critical


mass is reached. The data confirm this prediction: among post-threshold adopters,


amplification and days to adoption are significantly negatively correlated ( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 60,


_p_ = 0 _._ 039). Banks in the early post-threshold period (days 1–100) have mean am

plification of 8.99, while late adopters (days 101+) have mean amplification of only


34


6.66.


Figure 7 displays the two-regime dynamics graphically. Panel (A) shows cumu

lative adoption over time, with the pre-threshold regime (blue shading) and post

threshold regime (red shading) clearly demarcated. The founding members’ adoption


at day 0 represents crossing the critical mass threshold, after which adoption proceeds


through cascade dynamics. The cumulative amplification curve (dashed) rises faster


than the bank count curve (solid), confirming that high-amplification institutions


adopted disproportionately early.


Panel (B) shows adoption velocity over time. The spike at day 0 reflects the coor

dinated adoption by founding members—precisely the “large shock” that Corollary


2.1 identifies as necessary to cross the critical mass threshold. Subsequent adoption


proceeds at a more gradual pace, with velocity declining over time as the remaining


low-amplification banks adopt.


Figure 7: Two-Regime Adoption Dynamics


Notes: Panel (A) shows cumulative adoption (solid) and cumulative amplification (dashed)
over time. Blue shading indicates the pre-threshold regime; red shading indicates the
post-threshold regime. The founding members’ adoption at day 0 crosses the critical
mass threshold (42% of total amplification). Panel (B) shows adoption velocity (banks
per month) by time period. The spike at day 0 reflects coordinated founding member
adoption.


Figure 8 provides additional evidence for the two-regime characterization. Panel


(A) fits a logistic S-curve to the cumulative adoption data. The estimated inflection


point _t_ 0 = 89 days corresponds to the transition from accelerating to decelerating


35


adoption—the point at which half of eventual adopters have joined. This S-curve pat

tern is precisely what the L´evy extension predicts: slow initial growth (pre-threshold


diffusion), rapid acceleration (post-threshold cascade), and eventual saturation.


Panel (B) compares pre-threshold and post-threshold adopters directly. Founding


members have both higher count-weighted importance (5 banks) and dramatically


higher amplification-weighted importance (mean _A_ = 11 _._ 81 versus 7.82 for post

threshold adopters). This pattern confirms that critical mass was reached through


adoption by the highest-amplification institutions, consistent with the framework’s


prediction that technology leaders with outsized network influence adopt first.


Figure 8: S-Curve Dynamics and Pre- versus Post-Threshold Comparison


Notes: Panel (A) shows cumulative adoption with logistic S-curve fit. The inflection point
_t_ 0 = 89 days marks the transition from accelerating to decelerating adoption. Panel (B)
compares pre-threshold (founding members) and post-threshold adopters. Pre-threshold
adopters have significantly higher mean amplification factors ( _t_ = 2 _._ 96, _p_ = 0 _._ 010).


These empirical patterns provide strong support for the Two-Regime Character

ization (Proposition 2.10). The founding members’ coordinated adoption at launch


created sufficient network externalities to trigger cascade dynamics, with subsequent


adoption proceeding through the post-threshold regime where positive feedback accel

erates diffusion. The declining amplification profile of successive adopters—from 11.81


(founding members) to 8.99 (early post-threshold) to 6.66 (late post-threshold)—


confirms that technology leaders adopt first, followed by progressively more peripheral


institutions as network externalities make adoption increasingly attractive.

## **5 Conclusion**

This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in fi

nancial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their


interaction. The framework is grounded in a master equation whose solution ad

mits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along


stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive


the Adoption Amplification Factor—a structural measure of technology leadership


that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a


localized shock.


The framework makes three contributions to the literature on technology adop

tion and dynamic coordination. First, it provides a unified treatment that nests


canonical models as special cases through explicit mathematical identification. The


network externality model of Katz and Shapiro (1985) emerges at discrete network


steady state with the externality function _v_ ( _ni_ ) = _νn_ - _j_ _[G][ij][τ][j][/κ]_ [. The dynamic co-]


ordination model of Frankel and Pauzner (2000) emerges when spatial and network


dimensions collapse to a single aggregate state, with strategic complementarity pa

rameter ( _νs_ + _νn_ ) _/κ_ . The timing friction framework of Guimaraes et al. (2020) cor

responds directly to the decay parameter: their Poisson revision rate _λ_ equals the


adjustment rate _κ_ in the master equation. These nesting relationships, established


through the discrete Feynman-Kac formula, clarify how existing insights generalize to


richer spatial-network settings while demonstrating that the framework unifies rather


than replaces conventional methods.


Second, the framework introduces the spatial-network interaction as a distinct


channel of technology spillovers. Existing models consider either spatial diffusion or


network effects in isolation. The interaction term captures amplification when both


channels operate simultaneously—when geographic neighbors are also network part

ners, as is common in financial markets where institutions form business relationships


disproportionately with geographic neighbors. The channel decomposition of the am

37


plification factor reveals the relative importance of spatial, network, and interaction


channels for each institution’s role as a technology leader. Monte Carlo simulations


confirm that the amplification factor accurately predicts technology leadership, with


correlation of 0.996 between theoretical amplification and simulated cascade effects.


Third, the L´evy extension with state-dependent jump intensity provides a rig

orous treatment of critical mass dynamics that generates testable predictions about


two-regime adoption patterns. The jump-diffusion framework predicts that below


critical mass, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above critical mass, cas

cade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. In the limit where jump


intensity becomes infinite above threshold, the framework converges to deterministic


cascade models, clarifying that continuous diffusion and discrete cascades describe


different regimes of the same phenomenon rather than competing approaches.


The empirical application to SWIFT gpi adoption among Global Systemically


Important Banks provides strong validation of the framework’s predictions, including


the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier


( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 69, _p_ = 0 _._ 002), with founding members representing 29 percent of banks


but 39 percent of total system amplification. This concentration of amplification


among early adopters is precisely what the framework predicts: high-amplification


institutions—those whose adoption decisions cascade most strongly through the


system—adopt first, pushing the market above critical mass.


The two-regime dynamics are strikingly evident in the data. Pre-threshold


adopters (founding members) have significantly higher mean amplification factors


than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, _t_ = 2 _._ 96, _p_ = 0 _._ 010). Within the


post-threshold period, amplification and adoption timing remain negatively correlated


( _ρ_ = _−_ 0 _._ 60, _p_ = 0 _._ 039), with mean amplification declining from 8.99 for early post

threshold adopters to 6.66 for late adopters. This declining amplification profile—


from technology leaders to progressively more peripheral institutions—matches the


theoretical prediction that network externalities make adoption increasingly attrac

38


tive as critical mass is reached, drawing in lower-amplification institutions who benefit


from the network effects created by earlier adopters. The cumulative adoption curve


exhibits classic S-curve dynamics with inflection point at approximately 89 days, con

sistent with the transition from accelerating to decelerating growth predicted by the


L´evy extension.


Controlling for network position and firm size reveals that CEO age delays adop

tion by 11–15 days per year, consistent with the management literature on technol

ogy hesitancy among older executives. This finding demonstrates that both network


structure and individual characteristics matter for technology diffusion in financial


systems, and that the framework can identify firm-level determinants of adoption


timing after accounting for network effects.


The framework has implications for technology policy in financial infrastructure.


The Adoption Amplification Factor identifies technology leaders whose adoption de

cisions have outsized influence on system-wide outcomes. Policy interventions—


subsidies, mandates, pilot programs—should target high-amplification institutions to


maximize spillovers per dollar spent. The two-regime dynamics suggest that interven

tion timing matters: resources should be concentrated to push adoption above critical


mass rather than spread thinly over time. The empirical finding that five founding


members (29% of banks) were sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics by contributing


39% of system amplification provides concrete guidance on the scale of coordinated


action required to overcome coordination failures.


Several directions for future research emerge from this analysis. Extensions to


competing technologies can characterize the dynamics of standards competition and


the conditions for tipping to dominant standards. The dual externality extension


balancing adoption benefits against systemic risk from technology concentration can


inform optimal standardization policy—universal adoption creates interoperability


benefits but also systemic vulnerability if the common platform fails. Applying the


framework to other financial technologies, including distributed ledger systems, real

39


time payment networks, and regulatory technology platforms, can test the generality


of the two-regime adoption patterns documented here. Finally, structural estimation


of the diffusion parameters ( _νs, νn, κ_ ) and critical mass threshold ¯ _τ_ _[∗]_ using adoption


timing data would enable quantitative policy analysis and counterfactual simulations.
