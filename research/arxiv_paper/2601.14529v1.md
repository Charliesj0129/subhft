# From Columns to Heaps: Dimensionless Similarity with PSD-Distributed Damk¨ohler Numbers and Dual-Porosity Flow

#### Juan J. Segura [∗] January 22, 2026

**Abstract**


This work develops a unified, dimensionless framework for comparing geometri

cally similar reacting porous-flow systems across scale, with emphasis on hydromet

allurgical heap leaching, when particle size distribution (PSD) and intraparticle


pore structure differ. Under dynamic similarity, the dimensionless liquid residence

time distribution (RTD) is identical, but differences in PSD and internal porosity


break microscopic similarity. Using the shrinking-core model (SCM), the analy

sis shows how a PSD in particle diameter maps to a distribution of particle-scale


Damk¨ohler numbers that governs heap-averaged conversion.


Explicit PSD to Damk¨ohler transformations are derived for (i) external film con

trol, (ii) intraparticle diffusion control, and (iii) mixed control via additive rates.


Dual-porosity hydrology relevant to sedimentary or strongly stratified ores is then


incorporated by coupling SCM kinetics to mobile and immobile liquid domains,


introducing additional dimensionless groups that describe interporosity exchange.


Two numerical examples map a lognormal PSD into film- and diffusion-controlled


Damk¨ohler distributions and compare column/heap conversion for different PSDs.


A practical workflow is outlined for hydrometallurgical column-test interpretation,

combining tracer RTD calibration with PSD-aware kinetic fitting in dimensionless


time. The framework clarifies why diffusion-controlled leaching is far more sensi

tive to PSD tails and dual-porosity structure than film-controlled leaching, and it


identifies the compact set of dimensionless groups that must be matched to ensure


similarity between laboratory columns and industrial heaps.

### **1 Introduction**


Heap leaching is a key unit operation in the hydrometallurgical processing of copper,


gold, uranium and other commodities, and is likely to remain so as lower-grade and more


complex ores are brought into production [Dixon and Petersen, 2003, 2004, Dixon et al.,


2021]. Industrial heaps are large, highly heterogeneous systems in which chemistry, flow


and transport interact over a wide range of time and length scales. Despite the advances


of the last two decades in column testing, 1D and 2D modelling, and field monitoring,


scale-up from laboratory columns and on-off pads to multi-lift commercial heaps still


relies heavily on engineering judgement and empirical factors [Dixon, 2003, ElGhamrawy


et al., 2022, Robertson, 2017, Miao et al., 2017, Blackmore et al., 2018].


Two aspects are particularly important in practice. First, the hydrodynamics of drip

irrigated heaps—including unsaturated flow, channeling, and dual-porosity behaviour—


control the residence time distribution (RTD) of the leaching solution, the extent of


ponding and saturation, and the degree to which the solution actually contacts reactive


mineral surfaces [Dixon, 2003, McBride et al., 2018, Rodrigues et al., 2023, Robertson,


2017, Miao et al., 2017, 2021]. Second, the mineral itself is distributed among a range


of particle sizes and internal pore structures. The particle size distribution (PSD), inter

nal porosity and the presence of product layers within particles jointly determine which


rate-controlling mechanisms (external mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion, or surface re

action) are most important, and how much of the mineral becomes effectively “locked” in


diffusion-limited domains [Szekely et al., 1975, Fuerstenau, 2005, Fogler, 2005, Moreno

Pulido et al., 2025].


Most mechanistic heap-leach models developed for hydrometallurgical systems incor

porate some combination of advection–dispersion flow, dual-porosity or dual-permeability


structure, and shrinking-core or related intraparticle kinetics [Dixon and Petersen, 2003,


2004, Dixon et al., 2021, Robertson, 2017, Miao et al., 2017, 2021, ElGhamrawy et al.,


2022]. These models are powerful, but their complexity can make it difficult to see clearly


which dimensionless groups control behaviour, how particle-scale heterogeneities map to


heap-scale responses, and what conditions must be matched between column tests and


industrial heaps to ensure meaningful similarity.


The purpose of this work is to provide a compact, dimensionless framework to clarify


these issues, with a focus on industrially relevant heap-leach systems. We proceed in


three main steps:


1. We discuss geometric and dynamic similarity at the reactor or heap scale, and show


how matching a small set of macroscopic dimensionless groups (e.g. Peclet number,


capillary and Bond numbers) leads to similar dimensionless RTDs for the liquid


phase in geometrically similar heaps.


2. Using the shrinking-core model (SCM), we show how a PSD induces a distribution


of particle-scale Damk¨ohler numbers under three commonly encountered regimes:


external film (convection) control, intraparticle diffusion control, and mixed control.


We derive explicit expressions that map a given PSD to a distribution of Damk¨ohler


numbers in each case, and we quantify how the coarse and fine tails of the PSD


affect the overall kinetics.


3. We embed the SCM into a dual-porosity hydrological framework of the type used


for sedimentary and strongly stratified ores [Robertson, 2017, Miao et al., 2017,


2021, Blackmore et al., 2018], and identify the additional dimensionless param

eters governing exchange between mobile (advective) and immobile (stagnant or


slowly flowing) liquid domains. We then illustrate the combined framework with


two simple numerical examples: (i) mapping a lognormal PSD into external- and


diffusion-controlled Damk¨ohler distributions, and (ii) an illustrative column/heap


example comparing heap-averaged conversion for fine and coarse PSDs under dif

3


ferent rate-controlling mechanisms.


The resulting dimensionless formulation is not a replacement for detailed numerical


models, but a complement. It provides a transparent language for interpreting laboratory


testwork, for comparing heaps with different PSDs and internal pore structures, and for


identifying which dimensionless groups must be matched to achieve physically meaningful


scale-up in hydrometallurgical heap leaching.

### **2 Analysis of the problem**

#### **2.1 Geometric similarity, RTD and Damk¨ohler numbers**


Non-ideal reactors, including packed beds and heaps, are often described using res

idence time distributions _E_ ( _t_ ) and corresponding dimensionless functions [Levenspiel,


1999, Fogler, 2016, Dixon, 2003, Rodrigues et al., 2023]. For a reactor of volume _V_ and


volumetric flow _Q_, the mean residence time is _τ_ = _V/Q_ . The dimensionless time and


RTD are

_θ_ = _[t]_ _E_ _[∗]_ ( _θ_ ) = _τE_ ( _t_ ) _._ (1)

_τ_ _[,]_


If two reactors are geometrically similar (all length ratios are equal) and dynamically


similar (e.g. same Reynolds, Froude and other relevant dimensionless numbers for the


carrier fluid), then the dimensionless RTD _E_ _[∗]_ ( _θ_ ) of the fluid phase is identical in both


units.


Chemical reactions introduce further dimensionless groups, notably Damk¨ohler num

bers

Da = [reaction timescale] _,_ (2)

flow timescale


and, in distributed systems, Peclet numbers comparing advection and dispersion. In


heterogeneous systems, additional groups characterise intraparticle diffusion (e.g. Thiele


moduli) and the relative importance of mass transfer resistances [Fogler, 2016, Szekely


et al., 1975, Fogler, 2005, Moreno-Pulido et al., 2025].

#### **2.2 Heap leaching as a porous reactor**

Consider a heap of height _H_, irrigated from the top with superficial liquid flux _q_ and


porosity _ε_ . The interstitial velocity is _u_ = _q/ε_, and a natural macroscopic time scale is


the advective residence time




_[εH]_
_u_ [=] _q_



_τ_ heap = _[H]_



(3)
_q_ _[.]_



We introduce dimensionless variables


_t_

_Z_ = _[z]_ Θ = _,_ (4)

_H_ _[,]_ _τ_ heap


and write a standard 1D advection–dispersion equation for the reagent concentration


_C_ ( _z, t_ ),




_[∂C]_ _∂X_ [¯]

_∂t_ [+ (1] _[ −]_ _[ε]_ [)] _[ ρ][s]_ _∂t_




_[∂C]_ _[∂]_

_∂z_ [=]




_,_ (5)



_∂z_



_ε_ _[∂C]_



_X_

_∂t_ [+] _[ u]_ _[∂C]_ _∂z_




- _∂C_
_D_ ax

_∂z_



where _X_ [¯] ( _z, t_ ) is the local, particle-averaged solid conversion, _D_ ax is an effective axial


dispersion coefficient, and _ρs_ is the solid density. The corresponding Peclet number is


Peheap = _[uH]_ _._ (6)

_D_ ax


For two geometrically similar heaps operated at the same Peheap and similar satura

tion/wetting conditions, the dimensionless RTD of the liquid phase is expected to be


similar [Dixon, 2003, McBride et al., 2018, Dixon et al., 2021].


In addition to the heap-scale length _H_, the system includes a second length scale, the


particle diameter _dp_ . A fundamental geometric ratio is


_δ_ = _[d][p]_ (7)

_H_ _[,]_


and the heap is characterised by a PSD _f_ ( _dp_ ), often expressed as a volume- or mass-based


probability density.


If two heaps are geometrically similar at the macroscopic level, but the PSDs differ,


then microscopic similarity is broken. Even if Peheap and other heap-scale hydrodynamic


5


groups are matched, the intraparticle transport and reaction behaviour will differ, and so


will the overall conversion.

### **3 Material and methods**

#### **3.1 Shrinking-core model for individual particles**


We briefly recall the SCM for spherical particles, which provides a natural microscopic


description for leaching and gas–solid reactions [Szekely et al., 1975, Fogler, 2005, Fuer

stenau, 2005, Moreno-Pulido et al., 2025].


Consider a spherical particle of initial radius _R_ 0 = _dp/_ 2, density _ρs_, and reactive solid


A, contacted by a reagent in the surrounding fluid at concentration _C∞_ . In the classical


SCM, an unreacted core of radius _R_ ( _t_ ) shrinks with time, surrounded by a product layer


through which the reagent must diffuse. Depending on the relative importance of external


mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion, and intrinsic interfacial reaction, different limiting


regimes arise.


In the regime where external mass transfer through a fluid film controls the rate, the


characteristic time scale for conversion follows


_ρsdp_
_t_ ext( _dp_ ) = _,_ (8)
6 _kf_ _C∞_


where _kf_ is a mass transfer coefficient.


The conversion of a single particle may be expressed as




_,_ (9)



_xp_ ( _dp, t_ ) = _g_ ext




- _t_
_t_ ext( _dp_ ) _[, C][∞]_



with a known function _g_ ext depending on the specific SCM formulation and reaction order.


When diffusion through the product layer is rate-limiting, the characteristic time scale


is

_ρsd_ [2] _p_
_t_ diff( _dp_ ) = _,_ (10)
6 _D_ eff _C∞_


6


where _D_ eff is an effective diffusivity in the product layer. The conversion of a particle is




_,_ (11)



_xp_ ( _dp, t_ ) = _g_ diff




- _t_
_t_ diff( _dp_ ) _[, C][∞]_



with _g_ diff again determined by the SCM expressions, e.g. the well-known diffusion-controlled


shrinking-core formula 1 _−_ 3(1 _−_ _x_ ) [2] _[/]_ [3] + 2(1 _−_ _x_ ) = const _× t_ .


Eqs. (8) and (10) exhibit the key scale dependencies:


_t_ ext _∝_ _dp,_ _t_ diff _∝_ _d_ [2] _p_ _[.]_ (12)


Thus, for a given heap-scale time _τ_ heap, the ratio



_R_ ( _dp_ ) = _[t]_ [dif]




_[t]_ [dif] = _[K]_ [ext]

_t_ ext _K_ diff



_dp_ (13)
_K_ diff



varies with _dp_, where _K_ ext and _K_ diff are constants defined below. Small particles tend


to be more affected by diffusion control, large particles by film control, and intermediate


sizes may lie in a mixed regime.

#### **3.2 Particle-scale Damk¨ohler numbers and their distributions**


For a heap with characteristic time _τ_ heap, it is natural to define particle-scale Damk¨ohler


numbers for the film- and diffusion-controlled mechanisms:



_τ_ heap
Daext( _dp_ ) = [6] _[k][f]_ _[C][∞][τ]_ [heap]
_t_ ext( _dp_ ) [=] _ρs_



1
= _[K]_ [ext] _,_ (14)
_dp_ _dp_



_τ_ heap _[C][∞][τ]_ [heap]
Dadiff( _dp_ ) =
_t_ diff( _dp_ ) [= ][6] _[D]_ [ef] _ρs_



1
= _[K]_ [dif] _,_ (15)
_d_ [2] _p_ _d_ [2] _p_



with




_[∞][τ]_ [heap] _[C][∞][τ]_ [heap]

_,_ _K_ diff = [6] _[D]_ [ef]
_ρs_ _ρs_



_K_ ext = [6] _[k][f]_ _[C][∞][τ]_ [heap]



_._ (16)
_ρs_



7


For a given dimensionless heap time Θ = _t/τ_ heap, one can write



_xp_ ( _dp,_ Θ) =










_g_ ext�Θ Daext( _dp_ ) _, C∞_ - _,_ film control _,_



(17)
_g_ diff�Θ Dadiff( _dp_ ) _, C∞_ - _,_ diffusion control _._









The heap-averaged conversion at time Θ is then


               - _∞_
_X_ heap(Θ) = _xp_ ( _dp,_ Θ) _f_ ( _dp_ ) _ddp,_ (18)

0


where _f_ ( _dp_ ) is the PSD.


Let _f_ ( _dp_ ) be a normalised PSD,


              - _∞_

_f_ ( _dp_ ) _ddp_ = 1 _._ (19)
0


We wish to determine the induced probability density _g_ (Da) of a Damk¨ohler number of


interest, using change-of-variable formulas.


**3.2.1** **External film control**


For external control, Da = Daext = _K_ ext _/dp_, so




[ext] _ddp_

Da _[,]_ _d_ Da [=] _[ −][K]_ Da [ext][2]



_dp_ = _[K]_ [ext]




_[.]_ (20)
Da [2]



Thus, the pdf _g_ ext(Da) is


          - _K_ ext
_g_ ext(Da) = _f_

Da



_ddp_  - _K_ ext

= _f_

����� _d_ Da���� Da




- _K_ ext

_[.]_ (21)
Da [2]



Even if _f_ ( _dp_ ) is smooth and unimodal, the factor Da _[−]_ [2] can skew the Da-distribution.


8


**3.2.2** **Intraparticle diffusion control**


For diffusion control, Da = Dadiff = _K_ diff _/d_ [2] _p_ [, so]







_K_ dif



dif _ddp_

Da _[,]_ _d_ Da [=] _[ −]_ [1] 2



_dp_ =


The pdf _g_ diff(Da) becomes

~~�~~

_K_ diff Da _[−]_ [3] _[/]_ [2] _._ (22)




- ~~�~~



_K_ dif

2



_g_ diff(Da) = _f_




~~�~~

_K_ diff Da _[−]_ [3] _[/]_ [2] _._ (23)



Here the weighting Da _[−]_ [3] _[/]_ [2] and the square-root mapping in the argument of _f_ make the


resulting Da-distribution even more sensitive to the small-particle (large-Da) tail of the


PSD than in the film-controlled case.


**3.2.3** **Mixed control (series resistances)**


When both external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion contribute significantly, the


SCM becomes more complex [Szekely et al., 1975, Fogler, 2005, Moreno-Pulido et al.,


2025]. For scaling and similarity arguments, a useful approximation is to treat the two


mechanisms as resistances in series, with an effective characteristic time satisfying


1 1 1
_≈_ + _._ (24)
_t_ char _t_ ext _t_ diff


This leads to an effective Damk¨ohler number



_τ_ heap
Daeff( _dp_ ) = _[K]_ [ext]
_t_ char( _dp_ ) _[≈]_ [Da][ext][(] _[d][p]_ [) + Da][diff][(] _[d][p]_ [) =] _dp_




[ext]

+ _[K]_ [dif]
_dp_ _d_ [2] _p_



_._ (25)
_d_ [2] _p_



To construct the corresponding distribution _g_ mix(Da), we solve for _dp_ as a function of


Da. Multiplying Eq. (25) by _d_ [2] _p_ [,]


Da _d_ [2] _p_ [=] _[ K]_ [ext] _[d][p]_ [+] _[ K]_ [diff] _[,]_ (26)


9


so _dp_ satisfies a quadratic equation


Da _d_ [2] _p_ _[−]_ _[K]_ [ext] _[d][p]_ _[−]_ _[K]_ [diff] [= 0] _[.]_ (27)


The physically relevant (positive) root is




    - _K_ ext [2] [+ 4] _[K]_ [dif][Da]
_dp_ (Da) = _[K]_ [ext][ +] _._ (28)

2 Da



Differentiating Daeff( _dp_ ) with respect to _dp_ gives



_d_ Da




[ext] _−_ [2] _[K]_ [dif]

_d_ [2] _p_ _d_ [3] _p_



_d_ Da

and hence
_ddp_
���� _d_ Da



_d_ [3] _p_

���� _K_ ext _dp_ + 2 _K_ diff



The mixed-control Damk¨ohler pdf is therefore


_g_ mix(Da) = _f_           - _dp_ (Da)� _dp_ (Da) [3] _,_ (31)

_K_ ext _dp_ (Da) + 2 _K_ diff


with _dp_ (Da) given by Eq. (28).

#### **3.3 Coupling shrinking-core kinetics to dual-porosity flow**


Many ore bodies, particularly sedimentary or strongly stratified deposits, exhibit internal


structure that naturally suggests a dual-porosity or dual-pore-system description: rela

tively open macropores or preferential channels that carry most of the advective flow,


and a larger volume of microporous matrix where most of the mineral resides and flow


is slow, diffusive, or quasi-stagnant. This picture is closely related to dual-porosity and


dual-permeability models developed in petroleum and hydrogeology [Barenblatt et al.,


1960, Warren and Root, 1963, Zimmerman et al., 1993, Dogru and Pruess, 2020], and


has been adapted to heap leaching in 1D column models and 3D pore-scale simulations


[Robertson, 2017, Miao et al., 2017, 2021, Blackmore et al., 2018, Dixon et al., 2021].


10


In a dual-porosity interpretation of heap leaching, the void space is partitioned into:


  - a mobile (advective) domain with porosity _εm_ and concentration _Cm_ ( _z, t_ ), and


  - an immobile (stagnant or slowly moving) domain with porosity _εim_ and concentra

tion _Cim_ ( _z, t_ ),


with _εm_ + _εim ≈_ _ε_ . The solid is mostly associated with the immobile domain, where


diffusion-controlled SCM kinetics are often most relevant.


A widely used structure for dual-porosity models in single-phase flow is to write


coupled balances for _Cm_ and _Cim_ with an interporosity mass-transfer term of the form


_α_ ( _Cm −_ _Cim_ ) [Barenblatt et al., 1960, Warren and Root, 1963, Zimmerman et al., 1993,


Robertson, 2017]. For a 1D heap, one may write





_−_ _α_ ( _Cm −_ _Cim_ ) _,_ (32)



_∂Cm_
_εm_



_m_

+ _u_ _[∂C][m]_

_∂t_ _∂t_



_∂Cim_
_εim_



(33)
_∂t_ [=] _[ α]_ [(] _[C][m][ −]_ _[C][im]_ [)] _[,]_



where _D_ ax _,m_ is an axial dispersion coefficient in the mobile domain, and _α_ is an inter

porosity exchange coefficient (units of s _[−]_ [1] ).


Introducing the macroscopic time and space scales,



_Z_ = _[z]_




_[z]_ Θ = _t_ _,_ _τ_ heap = _[H]_

_H_ _[,]_ _τ_ heap _u_



(34)
_u_ _[,]_



and defining dimensionless concentrations _C_ [ˆ] _m_ = _Cm/C∞_, _C_ [ˆ] _im_ = _Cim/C∞_, the mobile

domain balance becomes



_C_ [ˆ] _m_

_[∂][C]_ [ˆ] _[m]_
_∂_ Θ [+] _∂Z_



_∂C_ [ˆ] _m_

_∂Z_ [2]



with



_uH_
Pe _m_ = _,_ Λex = _ατ_ heap _._ (36)
_D_ ax _,m_


11


Similarly, the immobile-domain balance becomes



_εim_ _∂C_ [ˆ] _im_ _C∞_ _[−]_ [1]

_∂_ Θ [+ (1] _[ −]_ _[ε]_ [)] _[ ρ][s]_ _τ_ heap



_∂X_ [¯] - 
ˆ ˆ
_Cm −_ _Cim_ _._ (37)
_∂_ Θ [= Λ][ex]



It is common to introduce a capacity ratio


_ω_ = _[ε][im]_ _,_ (38)

_εm_


and a dimensionless exchange Damk¨ohler number


Daex = Λex = _ατ_ heap _._ (39)


With these definitions, Eqs. (35)–(37) show that a dual-porosity heap is characterised, at


the macroscopic level, by Pe _m_, _ω_ and Daex, in addition to the particle-scale Damk¨ohler


numbers of Sec. 3.2.

#### **3.4 Parameter-estimation workflow (illustrative example)**


Although this work is primarily a similarity and scaling analysis, the same dimensionless


structure supports practical parameter estimation from column tests. The objective is to


infer a minimal set of _mechanistic_ parameters (e.g. _kf_, _D_ eff, _α_, _D_ ax) or, equivalently, their


dimensionless combinations (e.g. _K_ ext, _K_ diff, Daex, Pe _m_ ), from tracer RTD experiments


and leaching conversion data.


**3.4.1** **Step A: Hydrodynamic calibration from RTD**


A conservative tracer test provides the outlet RTD _E_ ( _t_ ), from which the mean residence


time _τ_ and the dimensionless RTD _E_ _[∗]_ ( _θ_ ) = _τE_ ( _t_ ) are computed [Levenspiel, 1999]. A 1D


advection–dispersion (or dual-porosity) model is then calibrated to the tracer response


to estimate hydraulic parameters:


  - Single-domain: estimate _D_ ax (thus Peheap = _uH/D_ ax).


  - Dual-porosity: estimate ( _D_ ax _,m, α, ω_ ), thus (Pe _m,_ Daex _, ω_ ).


12


This separation is useful because tracer RTD fitting is largely independent of leaching


kinetics, improving identifiability.


**3.4.2** **Step B: Particle-scale kinetic calibration from leaching curves**


Let _X_ heap( _t_ ) denote the measured heap-averaged solid conversion in a column (or a repre

sentative segment of a heap). Given a measured PSD _f_ ( _dp_ ) and calibrated hydrodynamics


from Step A, kinetic parameters can be inferred by minimising a least-squares objective


on _dimensionless_ time:



min
_**p**_



_N_



_i_ =1




- _X_ heap [model][(Θ] _[i]_ [;] _**[ p]**_ [)] _[ −]_ _[X]_ heap [data][(Θ] _[i]_ [)] �2 _,_ Θ _i_ = _ti/τ_ heap _,_ (40)



where _**p**_ may be chosen as ( _kf_ _, D_ eff) or equivalently ( _K_ ext _, K_ diff). Under external film con

trol, the model depends primarily on _K_ ext through Daext( _dp_ ) [Eq. (14)], whereas under


diffusion control it depends primarily on _K_ diff through Dadiff( _dp_ ) [Eq. (15)]. In mixed con

trol, both parameters influence the fit and can be partially correlated; the distributional


mapping [Eqs. (21), (23), (31)] clarifies which PSD fractions constrain which resistance.


**3.4.3** **Step C: Consistency checks and uncertainty**


A practical diagnostic is to repeat the fit under (i) film-only, (ii) diffusion-only, and


(iii) mixed control, and compare residual structure. For example, a persistent late-time


underprediction under film-only kinetics often indicates diffusion or immobile-domain


limitations, whereas early-time underprediction under diffusion-only kinetics may indicate


finite external mass transfer. Uncertainty can be quantified by bootstrap resampling of


the time points or by estimating the local curvature (Hessian) of the objective near the


optimum, reporting confidence intervals on ( _K_ ext _, K_ diff) and, if dual porosity is used, on


( _ω,_ Daex).


**3.4.4** **Workflow summary**


In compact form, a recommended workflow is:


13


(1) Measure PSD _f_ ( _dp_ ) and column geometry/irrigation to define _τ_ heap.


(2) Run tracer RTD _⇒_ fit hydrodynamics (Pe, and if needed _ω,_ Daex).


(3) Run leaching _X_ heap( _t_ ) _⇒_ fit ( _K_ ext _, K_ diff) (or _kf_ _, D_ eff).


(4) Validate by predicting a second irrigation condition or a second PSD.

### **4 Results and discussion**

#### **4.1 Numerical illustrations**


To illustrate the preceding framework, we present two simple numerical examples. The


goal is not to fit any particular experimental system, but rather to demonstrate how


the PSD and the choice of rate-controlling mechanism influence the distributions of


Damk¨ohler numbers and the heap-averaged conversion in a dimensionless setting.


**4.1.1** **Example 1: lognormal PSD and Damk¨ohler distributions**


We consider a lognormal PSD for the particle diameter,

_f_ ( _dp_ ) = ~~_√_~~
_dpσ_ ln








- ln _dp_ _−_ _µ_ ln�2

2 _σ_ ln [2]



_,_ (41)



2 _π_ [exp]




_−_



with median _d_ 50 = 10 mm and geometric standard deviation _σg_ = exp( _σ_ ln) _≈_ 1 _._ 65


( _σ_ ln = 0 _._ 5). We discretise _dp ∈_ [1 _,_ 50] mm on a fine grid and normalise _f_ ( _dp_ ) numerically.


We choose dimensionless constants _K_ ext = 10 _[−]_ [4] and _K_ diff = 10 _[−]_ [6] . For the chosen


PSD, the particle-scale Damk¨ohler numbers



Daext( _dp_ ) = _[K]_ [ext]




[ext]

_,_ Dadiff( _dp_ ) = _[K]_ [dif]
_dp_ _d_ [2] _p_



(42)
_d_ [2] _p_



are of order 10 _[−]_ [3] –10 _[−]_ [1] over the size range of interest, corresponding to moderately slow


reaction relative to the heap residence time. Using the change-of-variable formulas in


Eqs. (21) and (23), we construct the induced pdfs _g_ ext(Da) and _g_ diff(Da) by mapping the


_dp_ grid to Da and renormalising.


14


For these parameter values, we obtain approximate statistics

The diffusion-controlled distribution is much more skewed than the film-controlled


one: although 90% of Dadiff values lie between _≈_ 2 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [3] and _≈_ 5 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [2], the mean


is an order of magnitude larger, reflecting a long upper tail dominated by the smallest


particles.

with _d_ 50 = 10 mm and _σ_ ln = 0 _._ 5, for _K_ ext = 10 _[−]_ [4] and _K_ diff = 10 _[−]_ [6] . The diffusion

controlled case reveals a broader, more skewed distribution with a heavier upper (high

Da) tail.


Figure 1 compares _g_ ext(Da) and _g_ diff(Da) on semi-logarithmic axes. The film-controlled


distribution is relatively narrow, whereas the diffusion-controlled distribution exhibits a


pronounced right tail. This quantitatively illustrates that, for a given PSD, diffusion

controlled kinetics are more sensitive to the presence of a fine fraction, which can dominate


the overall reaction rate despite contributing a small fraction of the total solid mass.


15


This behaviour follows directly from the mapping Dadiff _∝_ _d_ _[−]_ _p_ [2][: even a modest fine]


fraction translates into a disproportionately large high-Da population. As a consequence,


diffusion-controlled heaps can appear kinetically “fast” at early times while simultane

ously remaining sensitive to the slow leaching of coarse particles at late times, motivating


explicit reporting (and, when feasible, preservation) of PSD tails in scale-up studies.


**4.1.2** **Example 2: illustrative heap conversions for fine and coarse PSDs**


As a second illustration, consider two lognormal PSDs with the same geometric standard


deviation _σ_ ln = 0 _._ 5 but different medians: a “fine” PSD with _d_ 50 = 8 mm, and a “coarse”


PSD with _d_ 50 = 20 mm. We again take _K_ ext = 10 _[−]_ [4] and _K_ diff = 10 _[−]_ [6], and discretise


_dp ∈_ [1 _,_ 50] mm with the same numerical resolution.


For each PSD, we compute the corresponding Damk¨ohler numbers Daext( _dp_ ) and


Dadiff( _dp_ ) and then approximate the heap-averaged conversion at dimensionless time Θ


using simple surrogate SCM-like expressions:




     - _∞_
_X_ heap [(film)][(Θ)] _[ ≈]_

     - _∞_
_X_ heap [(diff)][(Θ)] _[ ≈]_

- 1 _−_ exp - _−_ Θ




~~�~~ [�]
Dadiff( _dp_ ) _f_ ( _dp_ ) _ddp._ (44)



These surrogate forms mimic the qualitative behaviour of SCM kinetics in film- and


diffusion-controlled regimes while keeping the numerical example analytically simple.

stronger dependence on PSD.


Figure 2 shows the resulting trajectories _X_ heap(Θ) for Θ _∈_ [0 _,_ 5]. At representative

Diffusion control, fine PSD 0 _._ 13 0 _._ 48


Diffusion control, coarse PSD 0 _._ 056 0 _._ 24


Several trends emerge:


  - For both mechanisms, the fine PSD leaches faster than the coarse PSD, as expected


from Eqs. (14)–(15).


  - The diffusion-controlled cases show significantly higher conversions at fixed Θ than


the film-controlled cases for the chosen parameters, reflecting the larger typical


Dadiff values.


17


  - The _relative_ penalty for coarsening the PSD is more pronounced when diffusion


dominates: at Θ = 5, the coarse-PSD conversion is about 41% of the fine-PSD


value under film control and about 51% under diffusion control, but the absolute


gap in _X_ is much larger in the latter. This is consistent with the stronger _dp_   

dependence of Dadiff _∝_ _d_ _[−]_ _p_ [2][.]


A practical implication is that a single “representative” particle size is more defensible


under film control than under diffusion control. When diffusion dominates, the PSD


induces a broad distribution of characteristic times, so late-time recovery is governed by


the coarse tail while early-time response can be dominated by fines. This separation


of time scales is further amplified if dual porosity limits reagent access to the reactive


matrix.

#### **4.2 Similarity criteria and sensitivity to PSD and dual porosity**


The expressions above allow us to state precise similarity conditions for two geometrically


similar heaps, A and B, that differ in PSD and internal pore structure. Suppose that:


  - The heaps have the same macroscopic geometry (same aspect ratios, slope angles,


etc.).


  - They are operated with the same fluid properties, reagent concentration _C∞_, and


temperature.


  - The macroscopic hydrodynamics are dynamically similar (same Peheap or Pe _m_, sim

ilar saturation and capillary numbers).


  - The dual-porosity structure is similar in the dimensionless sense ( _ω_ and Daex


matched).


Then the dimensionless RTD of the liquid phase and the partitioning between mobile


and immobile domains are the same in both heaps. However, unless their _dimensionless_


PSDs match (e.g. the PSD scaled by heap height, _dp/H_, is identical), the distributions


18


of particle-scale Damk¨ohler numbers _g_ ext(Da), _g_ diff(Da), or _g_ mix(Da), and their ratios to


Daex, will in general differ.


Because Dadiff _∝_ 1 _/d_ [2] _p_ [, diffusion-controlled heaps are significantly more sensitive to]


changes in PSD tails than film-controlled heaps, where Daext _∝_ 1 _/dp_ . In mixed-control


systems, the relative importance of film and diffusion contributions varies across the


PSD, which can lead to complex responses of heap performance to changes in crushing


or agglomeration practices. Dual-porosity structure further modulates this picture by


controlling how effectively reagent in the mobile domain can access the immobile, reactive


matrix.


From a scale-up perspective, this analysis suggests that matching only macroscopic


hydrodynamic dimensionless groups is generally insufficient. For true similarity in heap


leaching performance, one must also match the PSD in dimensionless form and, if possi

ble, the distributions of relevant Damk¨ohler numbers implied by the SCM, as well as the


dual-porosity parameters _ω_ and Daex. This observation is consistent with more detailed,


numerically intensive models of heap leaching that resolve both hydrology and intraparti

cle transport [Dixon and Petersen, 2003, 2004, Robertson, 2017, Miao et al., 2017, 2021,


Dixon et al., 2021, ElGhamrawy et al., 2022].

### **5 Conclusions**


We developed a dimensionless framework that separates hydrodynamic similarity (from


RTD/transport) from microscopic similarity (from PSD-dependent particle-scale kinet

ics), and shows how both must be matched for robust heap-leach scale-up. While the


derivations draw on standard concepts from chemical reaction engineering, the empha

sis throughout has been on quantities that are directly relevant to column testing and


industrial heap design.


At the macroscopic level, we highlighted how geometric and dynamic similarity in the


hydrology (e.g. matching heap geometry, irrigation conditions, and Peclet and capillary


numbers) leads to similar dimensionless RTDs in geometrically similar heaps. For heaps


that exhibit dual-porosity behaviour, we introduced additional dimensionless parameters—


a capacity ratio between mobile and immobile liquid domains and an interporosity Damk¨ohler


number Daex—which together control how rapidly reagent in advective channels can


20


access the reactive matrix. These parameters naturally complement the dimensionless


groups used in more detailed dual-porosity heap models reported in the hydrometallur

gical literature [Robertson, 2017, Miao et al., 2017, 2021, Blackmore et al., 2018, Dixon


et al., 2021].


At the microscopic level, we used the shrinking-core model to derive explicit expres

sions for how a PSD in particle diameter maps into distributions of Damk¨ohler numbers


under external film control, intraparticle diffusion control, and mixed control. These


formulas make quantitatively clear that:


  - For film-controlled systems, the relevant Damk¨ohler number scales as _d_ _[−]_ _p_ [1][, so coars-]


ening the PSD penalises leaching rates, but the sensitivity is moderate.


  - For diffusion-controlled systems, the Damk¨ohler number scales as _d_ _[−]_ _p_ [2][, leading to a]


much stronger dependence on PSD tails and a heavy-tailed distribution of particle

scale Damk¨ohler numbers.


  - In mixed-control systems, each particle is characterised by a pair of Damk¨ohler


numbers (for film and diffusion) or an effective Damk¨ohler number and a resistance


ratio. The PSD therefore induces a one-dimensional curve in this two-dimensional


parameter space, and the impact of changing the PSD depends on how this curve


spans regions of film-, diffusion- and mixed-control behaviour.


Simple numerical examples were used to illustrate these points. For a lognormal PSD


with parameters typical of crushed ore, the diffusion-controlled Damk¨ohler distribution


was found to be considerably more skewed than the film-controlled distribution, with the


smallest particles exerting a disproportionate influence on the mean Damk¨ohler number.


An illustrative heap example showed how fine and coarse PSDs produce markedly different


heap-averaged conversion trajectories under both mechanisms, with diffusion-controlled


systems exhibiting higher conversions but also larger absolute penalties when the PSD is


coarsened.


From a practical standpoint, the analysis suggests several implications for hydromet

allurgical heap leaching:


21


  - Matching only macroscopic hydraulic conditions (e.g. irrigation rate, solution chem

istry, overall RTD) between column tests and full-scale heaps is not sufficient for


predictive scale-up if the PSD and dual-porosity structure differ significantly.


  - Laboratory testwork intended to support design of industrial heaps should, where


possible, preserve not only the PSD but also the key dual-porosity parameters (mo

bile/immobile capacity ratio, interporosity exchange rate) and operating regimes


that determine whether film, diffusion or mixed control is dominant.


  - The dimensionless groups identified here provide a compact way to document and


compare column and heap conditions, to assess whether two systems are “similar


enough” for direct transfer of kinetic information, and to design sensitivity studies


on PSD and ore type.


The present framework could be extended in several directions of interest for future


work: coupling to microbially mediated kinetics in bioleaching, incorporating more gen

eral intraparticle reaction–diffusion models or multi-mineral ore textures, and embedding


the dimensionless structure into existing numerical simulators such as HeapSim or dual

porosity flow codes for parameter screening and model reduction. Ultimately, we hope


that expressing heap leaching in terms of a small set of well-defined dimensionless groups


will aid practitioners in designing more informative testwork, in understanding the im

pact of PSD and ore variability, and in achieving more robust and transparent scale-up


in hydrometallurgical heap operations.
