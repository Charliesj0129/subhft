I. INTRODUCTION

Amid surging demand for device access and growing service
diversity, efficiently managing and flexibly allocating spectrum
resources has become a major challenge in 6G network design

[1]. Traditional spectrum resource allocation typically relies on
static licensing mechanisms [2]. However, this mechanism faces
issues such as spectrum underutilization and difficulties in
accessing spectrum [3]. To address these problems, Dynamic
Spectrum Access (DSA) has become a key strategy to improve
spectrum utilization efficiency. DSA technology offers a more
flexible spectrum management approach to spectrum
management by allowing secondary users (SU) to utilize idle
frequency bands without interfering with primary users (PU),
thereby improving spectrum utilization [4]. Many countries and



regions are actively exploring spectrum sharing methods based
on DSA, such as the CBRS and the LSA [5]. However, DSA
faces several challenges in practical applications, including
centralized management risks, transaction record tampering, and
inefficient authorization processes [6].


To address the aforementioned challenges, an increasing
number of studies have begun applying blockchain technology
to spectrum management. The core characteristics of blockchain,
such as decentralization, immutability, and programmability,
offer new solutions for spectrum sharing, trading, and regulation

[7]. Blockchain-based smart contracts enable the automation of
key processes including spectrum licensing, revenue allocation,
thereby enhancing both operational efficiency and system
trustworthiness [8]. The feasibility of leveraging blockchain
technology for spectrum sharing has been explored in prior
studies. For instance, Perera et al. [9] introduced the Spect-NFT
framework. Shao et al. [6] proposed an NFT-based dynamic
spectrum sharing model for 6G networks. Ye et al. [10] and
Liang et al. [11] utilized the ERC4907 standard [12] to mint
rentable non-fungible spectrum tokens. However, the solutions
mentioned above still lack a mechanism to incentivize users to
share spectrum resources.


Zhou et al. [13] proposed an ERC404-style hybrid token
models based securitization approach for spectrum resources.
By tokenizing spectrum holdings, primary users PUs can reduce
asset holding risk, improve liquidity, and strengthen incentives
to participate in spectrum sharing. ERC404-style hybrid token
models [14] is a community proposed and experimental hybrid
token design that combines non-fungible token (NFT) [15] style
identity with fungible token (FT) [16] accounting to support
fractionalization and tradability. However typical ERC 404 style
implementations couple FT transfers with NFT mint and burn
operations. When balances cross unit thresholds NFT instances
are destroyed and recreated. This prevents any single NFT from
persistently representing the same underlying spectrum asset

and weakens continuity traceability and state stability. As a
result in [13] NFTs effectively encode only the quantity of
spectrum held by a PU but they cannot faithfully track the
spectrum resource dynamic operational status.


To overcome the structural limitations identified in [13], this
paper designs a spectrum securitization system and proposes the
SFT-Lock method, which replaces the traditional mint/burn
mechanism with a lock/unlock design. Unlike ERC404-style
hybrid token models, SFT-Lock does not redefine token
standards but introduces a state-transition mechanism that can
be layered on hybrid asset models. SFT-Lock eliminates the
need for token destruction, thereby preserving the identity and
historical continuity of NFTs throughout their lifecycle. It
further allows users to customize the locking and unlocking
sequence, offering flexible control over asset states. In addition,
a staking mechanism is introduced to transform static spectrum
resources into tradable securities, effectively unlocking their
liquidity and enhancing asset utility.


II. SYSTEM MODEL

This section introduces the system model of the proposed
spectrum securitization system. This system consists of three
contracts. The Spectrum Authorized Contract is responsible for the
initial tokenization of spectrum resources into Non-Fungible
Spectrum Tokens (NFSTs). The Spectrum Securitization Contract
allows PUs to stake their NFSTs in exchange for Securitized NFSTs
(SNFSTs) and Securitized Fungible Spectrum Tokens (SFSTs).
The Spectrum Sharing Contract enables the sharing of unused
spectrum resources with SUs.


_A._ _Roles and Contract Interactions_

Figure 2.1 illustrates the interaction between smart contracts
and the primary roles within the system. This system involves
four roles: SMA (Spectrum Management Authority), NDASP
(National Digital Asset Securitization Platform), PU and SU,
they participate in the system through smart contracts:


_1)_ _SMA:_ Responsible for the initial authorization and
registration of spectrum resources. It deploys the Spectrum
Authorized Contract, which includes:



_a)_ _Spectrum Resource Authorization Module:_ Enables
SMA to mint spectrum resources into NFSTs for PUs.

_b)_ _Spectrum Resource Reclaim Module:_ Enables SMA to
reclaim NFST held by PUs.

_2)_ _NDASP:_ Manages the securitization of spectrum assets.
It deploys the Spectrum Securitization Contract, which includes:

_a)_ _NFST Staking Module:_ Enables PUs to stake NFSTs to
initiate securitization and mint SNFSTs and SFSTs to PUs.

_b)_ _SFST Transfer Module:_ Enables users to transfer SFSTs
between each other, and leverages the lock/unlock mechanism
of the SFT-Lock method to manage the state transitions of
SNFSTs.

_3)_ _PU:_ Deploys the Spectrum Sharing Contract to facilitate
efficient spectrum utilization. This contract incorporates a
Spectrum Leasing Module, which is built upon the ERC4907
standard and enables PUs to mint Rental NFSTs (RNFSTs).
SUs can acquire RNFSTs by exchanging SFSTs, thereby
gaining temporary access to spectrum resources.


_B._ _SFT-Lock method_

To address the defects of the ERC404 style hybrid token
model in spectrum resource securitization, such as the reliance
on frequent minting and burning operations that compromise
NFT traceability and state consistency, this paper proposes SFTLock. SFT-Lock decouples asset divisibility from token identity
by introducing an explicit state transition layer. It maintains a set
of spectrum NFTs and maps fungible share transfers to
deterministic lock or unlock operations. Each spectrum NFT
persists with an explicit locked or unlocked state. The specific
logic is as follows:


_1)_ _NFT lock:_ When a FT is split, the master contract
updates a NFT status to "locked".

_2)_ _NFT unlock:_ When the PU aggregates a FT, the contract
resets a NFT status to "unlocked".


The detailed diagram of the SFT-Lock method is shown in
Figure 2.2.

III. SMART CONTRACT DESIGN


_A._ _Contract Architecture and State Transition_

This system implements blockchain based spectrum
securitization using three on chain contracts that separate
authorization, securitization, and sharing [1][4][8]. The
Spectrum Authorization contract maintains the NFST registry,
including spectrum metadata such as channel and location and
basic status flags, and exposes mintNFST and reclaimNFST.
The Spectrum Securitization contract escrows NFSTs and mints
securitized representations. It records an NFST ID to original
owner mapping and maintains each PU inventory of SNFST IDs
and SFST balances. The stakeNFST function transfers custody
of the NFST to escrow and mints SNFST and SFST to the PU.
The Spectrum Sharing contract provides time bounded usage
rights using the rentable NFT workflow [10]-[12], minting rental
NFTs that can be rented by SUs while preserving the underlying
securitization state.


After securitization, each spectrum unit is represented by an
SNFST with persistent NFT identity [15], while fractional
ownership is represented by SFST balances under ERC20
accounting [16]. Each SNFST corresponds to one spectrum unit.
Let share be the integer number of whole units implied by an
address SFST balance, where integer division rounds down.
After any SFST transfer, SNFST state changes are triggered
only when the integer share of the PU address changes. If the
PU share increases, the system unlocks the same number of
SNFST units. If the PU share decreases, the system locks the
same number of SNFST units. Transfers between SUs do not
change SNFST states unless they change the PU integer share.
Optional lockOrder and unlockOrder lists specify which SNFST
IDs transition first. For sharing, a PU mints a rental NFT and an
SU rents it under the ERC4907 workflow, while the underlying
securitization ownership state remains unchanged [10]-[12].


_B._ _Spectrum Authorization Module_

The spectrum authorization module initializes on chain
spectrum assets through two procedures, mintNFST() and
reclaimNFST(). When a PU is approved for spectrum usage,
SMA calls mintNFST() to create an NFST that records the
allocated spectrum metadata and serves as the digital
representation of the spectrum asset. The procedure is specified
in Algorithm 1. When the allocation is revoked or expires, SMA
calls reclaimNFST() to reclaim the corresponding NFST. The
procedure is specified in Algorithm 2.


**Algorithm 1:** mintNFST


**Input:** toAddress, channel, location
1: Increment global tokenIdCounter
2: Set newTokenId = tokenIdCounter
3: Create a new NFST entry:



4: tokenId = newTokenId
5: owner = toAddress
6: channel = channel
7: location = location
8: Mark (channel, location) as uploaded
9: Append newTokenId to:
10: Global minted NFST list
11: List of NFSTs owned by toAddress
12: **If** toAddress is not already marked as a PU **then**
13: Mark toAddress as a PU


**Algorithm 2:** reclaimNFST


**Input:** tokenId
1: Retrieve NFST info associated with tokenId
2: Mark (channel, location) as not uploaded
3: Remove tokenId from:
4: Global minted NFST list
5: List of NFSTs owned by contract owner
6: Mark the NFST as reclaimed
7: **If** contract owner no longer holds any NFSTs **then**
8: Mark contract owner as not a PU


_C._ _Spectrum Securitization Module_


**Algorithm 3:** stakeNFST


**Input:** PUAddress, tokenIdOfNFST
1: Retrieve NFST metadata from SMA:
2: owner, channel, location ← getNFSTInfo(tokenIdOfNFST)
3: Require: PU is the current owner of the NFST
4: Record original owner:
5: originOwnerOfNFST[tokenIdOfNFST] ← PU
6: Call the function of SMA’s contract to update stake info:
7: Set NFST's staking status to true
8: Assign current contract as the holder of the NFST
9: Mint a SNFST for PU, using tokenIdOfNFST, channel, location
10: Mint SFST for PU


PUs seeking to securitize their spectrum assets may invoke
the stakeNFST() function to stake an NFST into the Spectrum
Securitization Contract. Upon successful staking, the contract
mints a corresponding SNFST and SFST for the PU, which
together represent the tokenized form of the underlying
spectrum resource. Ownership of the original NFST is escrowed
in the securitization contract, while usage and economic rights
are represented by the SNFST/SFST pair. The logic of the
stakeNFST() function is detailed in Algorithm 3.


_D._ _SFST Transfer Module_

This module supports the core operations needed to lock and
unlock spectrum unit tokens, allow a PU to specify a preferred
transition order, and carry out SFST transfers that trigger
SNFST state updates when the PU integer share changes. The
lock and unlock procedure is specified in Algorithm 4 and 5.


**Algorithm 4:** lockSNFST


**Input:** PUAddress, tokenId, isOrder
1: Retrieve SNFST info associated with tokenId
2: Mark SNFST as locked
3: Remove tokenId from:
4: unlockedSNFST[PU]
5: Add tokenId to:
6: lockedSNFST[PU]
7: **If** isOrder is true **then**
8: Remove tokenId from lockOrder[PU]


**Algorithm 5:** unlockSNFST


**Input:** PUAddress, tokenId, isOrder
1: Retrieve SNFST info associated with tokenId
2: Mark SNFST as unlocked
3: Remove tokenId from:
4: lockedSNFST[PU]
5: Add tokenId to:
6: unlockedSNFST[PU]
7: **If** isOrder is true **then**
8: Remove tokenId from unlockOrder[PU]


The system also supports customizing the locking and
unlocking order of SNFSTs. This design enables policy-aware
state transitions when securitized spectrum assets exhibit
heterogeneous attributes such as expiration time, geographic
scope, or regulatory priority. The logic of setLockOrder()
function and setUnlockOrder() function is shown in Algorithm
6 and Algorithm 7.


**Algorithm 6:** setLockOrder


**Input:** tokenIdList
1: **For** each tokenId in tokenIdList **do**
2: Retrieve SNFST info
3: Require: Caller is the owner of the SNFST
4: Require: SNFST is not currently locked
5: Set lockOrder[caller] to tokenIdList


**Algorithm 7:** setUnlockOrder


**Input:** tokenIdList
1: **For** each tokenId in tokenIdList **do**
2: Retrieve SNFST info
3: Require: Caller is the owner of the SNFST
4: Require: SNFST is currently locked
5: Set unlockOrder[caller] to tokenIdList


The transfer() function implements the lock/unlock
mechanism defined in the SFT-Lock method and facilitates the
transfer of SFSTs between users. Because each SNFST
corresponds to a fixed unit of spectrum capacity, changes in
SFST balances deterministically imply the number of SNFSTs
that must transition between locked and unlocked states. The
transfer logic deterministically maps SFST balance changes to
SNFST state transitions, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence
between fungible shares and locked spectrum units. The logic of
the transfer() method is illustrated in Algorithm 8.


**Algorithm 8:** transfer


**Input:** from, to, PU, amount
1: unit ← 1 × 10 [18]
2: from_OldShare ← floor(userShares[PU][from] / unit)
3: to_OldShare ← floor(userShares[PU][to] / unit)
4: Call transferSFST(from, to, PU, amount)
5: from_CurrentShare ← floor(userShares[PU][from] / unit)
6: to_CurrentShare ← floor(userShares[PU][to] / unit)
7: **If** from == PU **then**
8: lockNum ← max(0, from_OldShare - from_CurrentShare)
9: orderLockNum ← min(lockNum, lockOrder[PU].length)
10: **For** i **from** 1 **to** orderLockNum **do**
11: lockSNFST(PU lockOrder[PU][0] true)
12: **For** i **from** 1 **to** lockNum - orderLockNum **do**
13: lockSNFST(PU unlockedSNFST[PU][0] false)
14: **If** to == PU **then**
15: unlockNum ← max(0, to_CurrentShare - to_OldShare)



16: orderUnlockNum←min(unlockNum, unlockOrder[PU].length)
17: **For** i **from** 1 **to** orderUnlockNum **do**
18: unlockSNFST(PU unlockOrder[PU][0] true)
19: **For** i **from** 1 **to** unlockNum - orderUnlockNum **do**
20: unlockSNFST(PU lockedSNFST[PU][0] false)


_E._ _Spectrum Sharing Module_


Spectrum Sharing Module implements spectrum resource
leasing function based on ERC4907 standard, enabling shortterm renting of spectrum resources. The minting and renting
methods for RNFST can refer to reference [10]-[12].


IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

To simulate real on-chain interactions, Ganache private
blockchain was chosen as the underlying operating network.
Contract development and deployment were conducted using
Solidity 0.8.x. Table Ⅰ lists the basic information of each user
and the contract addresses of Spectrum Authorized Contract and
Spectrum Securitization Contract.


TABLE I. BASIC INFORMATION AND DESCRIPTION OF EACH USER


Role Address Description
SMA 0x50C **…** BCB Allocate and reclaim spectrum resources and
deploy Spectrum Authorized Contract
NDASP 0x302…03a Responsible for spectrum securitization and
deployment of Spectrum Securitization
Contract
PU 0x0aa **…** f60 Receive spectrum SNFSTs and SFSTs, which
can be securitized and shared with SUs
SU 0x408 **…** F9F Buy SFSTs and rent RNFST using ETH


_A._ _Functional Verification_

In order to verify the effectiveness of the securitization
system based on the SFT-Lock method proposed in this paper, a
series of experiments were designed and carried out.


Fig. 4.1. Results of minting NFST.


SMA mints NFST by inputting the metadata of spectrum
resources. Figure 4.1 shows the smart contract execution result
of SMA minting NFST for the PU. After NFST is successfully
minted, the MINT_NFST event is triggered, recording that the
contract successfully minted spectrum NFST numbered 1 for the
PU. In the event parameters, _from is an all-zero address,
indicating that the NFT is newly minted rather than transferred.
_to indicates the recipient address, and _tokenId identifies the
unique number of the NFST.


When the right to use spectrum resources needs to be
reclaimed due to expiration, SMA can initiate a mandatory
recovery operation on the NFST held by the PU to ensure the
compliance of resource use. As shown in Figure 4.2, when SMA
reclaims NFST, the RECLAIM_NFST event is triggered,
indicating that the NFST numbered 2 has been reclaimed. In the


parameter, the _from field indicates that the owner of the NFST
is changed from the PU to SMA, and the reclaim operation is
performed by SMA.


Fig. 4.2. Results of SMA reclaim NFST.


Fig. 4.3. Spectrum resource securitization.


When the PU needs to securitize the spectrum resources it
holds, it can stake NFST to the Spectrum Securitization
Contract. As shown in Figure 4.3, the following events will be
triggered during the securitization process:


_1)_ _TRANSFER_SNFST:_ Records that the contract
successfully minted SNFST numbered 1 for the PU. In the
event parameters, _from is an all-zero address, indicating that
the NFT is newly minted. _to indicates the recipient's address,
and _tokenId identifies the unique number of the SNFST.

_2)_ _TRANSFER_SFST:_ Records that the contract mints the
SFST corresponding to SNFST numbered 1 to the PU. The
parameters include _from, _to, _primaryUser, and _amount (in
wei, 1 ETH = 1 × 10 [18 ] wei).


Fig. 4.4. SNFST lock order.


The PU securitizes NFST1 and NFST2 sequentially, obtaining
SNFST1 and SNFST2. Suppose that, due to business
requirements, the PU must lock SNFST2 before SNFST1. By
default, the locking order is SNFST1 → SNFST2. Therefore,
the PU modifies the priority locking order. As illustrated in



PU 2 1.7 lock
SU 0 0.3 N/A
PU 1.7 2 unlock
SU 0.3 0 N/A


In order to verify the unlocking function of SNFST, the SU
transfers 0.3 SFSTs to the PU. The execution result of the smart
contract is shown in Figure 4.6. The UNLOCK_SNFST event
represents the triggering of the SNFST unlocking event. In the
parameters, "_primaryUser" is the original holder address, and
"_tokenId" is the ID of the unlocked SNFST. Table II shows the



Figure 4.4, the PU sets the locking order to SNFST2 →
SNFST1, ensuring that SNFST2 is locked first.


Fig. 4.5. PU transfer SFSTs to SU


Fig. 4.6. SU transfer SFSTs to PU.


Subsequently, the PU calls the transfer() method to transfer
0.3 SFSTs to the SU. The execution result of the smart contract
is shown in Figure 4.5. The LOCK_SNFST event indicates that
SNFST2 is locked. In the parameters, _primaryUser is still the
PU, and _tokenId is the number of the locked SNFST. These
results confirm that spectrum securitization and subsequent
transfers do not create or destroy NFTs, but only induce state
transitions, thereby preserving NFT identity continuity.

_B._ _Performance comparison of SFT-Lock method and_

_ERC404-style hybrid token model_


Fig. 4.8. Gas consumption comparison


To compare the gas consumption of an ERC-404-style
mint/burn hybrid model and the proposed SFT-Lock method,
we implemented equivalent spectrum securitization modules
for both approaches. Both implementations were evaluated
under identical contract logic and compiler settings, differing
only in the use of mint/burn operations versus lock/unlock state
transitions. In Fig. 4.8, under the ERC404-style hybrid token
model, minting and burning operations consume 262,958 and
133,340 gas, respectively. In contrast, the SFT-Lock method
replaces these operations with lightweight unlock and lock state
transitions, which consume 86,617 and 103,700 gas,
respectively. This corresponds to a 67.1% reduction in gas
consumption for unlock compared to minting, and a 22.2%
reduction for lock compared to burning. Overall, the results
demonstrate that SFT-Lock significantly reduces on-chain gas
consumption and operational complexity relative to the
ERC404-style hybrid token model. This improvement arises
from the fact that SFT-Lock avoids token creation and
destruction, relying instead on constant-time state updates that
eliminate the storage allocation and deallocation overhead
inherent to minting and burning operations.


V. CONCLUSION

This paper presents a blockchain based spectrum resource
securitization system and introduces the SFT-Lock method.
SFT-Lock replaces the mint and burn operations used in ERC
404 style designs with a lock and unlock mechanism, which
avoids the continuity and traceability issues caused by repeated
NFT recreation. This design better fits spectrum securitization
and reduces gas consumption relative to ERC 404 style mint
and burn approaches. The system also provides a user-defined
lock/unlock priority feature to enable fine-grained asset
management. In addition, a staking mechanism is introduced to
convert static spectrum assets into tradable securities, thereby
enhancing their liquidity.
