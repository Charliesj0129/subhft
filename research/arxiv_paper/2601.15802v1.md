I. INTRODUCTION


Military and civil discreet operations can be carried out by
deploying a fleet of autonomous underwater drones in coastal
areas, without immediate access to a support vessel, which
remains in the open sea, and without access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). This application is typical
of areas where mapping or monitoring of natural phenomena or pollution is required, without access for the carrier
because of submerged bottom, a protected natural area, or
even a dangerous area under access ban, etc. GNSS-denied
underwater navigation is a necessity that arises in both civilian
and military contexts, when surfacing will compromise the
concealment provided by the underwater environment, because
the Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) would be detectable by visual, radar, and other surveillance systems. This
necessity may arise in civilian contexts, such as environmental monitoring, marine biology, delivering essential supplies
through humanitarian corridors, or offshore industry operations; precise and discreet navigation ensures that missions
are conducted without disturbing the natural environment or
sensitive sites. For military applications, navigating stealthily

and without GNSS is central for mapping and intelligence
gathering, and protecting underwater infrastructures.

The development and integration of advanced navigation technologies are critical to the success of these missions, ensuring
that UUVs can operate effectively underwater.

Despite the centrality of this challenge and the interest of
industrial research, GNSS-denied navigation for marine and
underwater vehicles remains rare in publicly available research, particularly when compared to the mature GNSSdenied alternative localization systems seen in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and terrestrial robots.

One of the main reasons GNSS cannot be used underwater
to locate a target is that GPS is unavailable due to the
rapid attenuation of high frequency electromagnetic waves
underwater [1].

Economic, industrial, and environmental strategies that control
submarine resources face several difficulties. Given that a fleet
of unmanned vehicles is a relevant solution for performing
inspection, cartography, and interventions, its reliable and
robust deployment requires solving several issues. On one
side, the environment is not always fully known, and is
strongly dynamic, which affects the capacity of the UUVs
in navigating. On the other side, GNSS is not available when
drones are immersed, which affects the correct localization of
the fleet and thus its navigation robustness.

To address this problem, the most common approaches use
acoustic localization systems, sometimes performing multisource data and sensor fusion.

Paull et al. [2] summarize common localization methods using
acoustic time-of-flight measurements. Underwater navigation
employs various acoustic methods for localization and tracking. Ultra-short baseline and short baseline systems operate
from ships, using time-of-flight and phase differences to calculate range and azimuth, but face limitations in range and accuracy. Long baseline (LBL) systems use widely spaced fixed
beacons for precise acoustic triangulation, though deployment
and calibration remain a complex task. Single fixed beacon
systems offer a cost-effective alternative, but lack unique position solutions. Both LBL and single beacon systems rely on
two-way travel time of acoustic signals. Additionally, mobile
underwater vehicles equipped with sensors can serve as an
alternative for target tracking.


Through-the-sensor (TTS) sub-bottom imaging [3] leverages
the autonomous UUV’s inherent self-noise as an acoustic
source for mapping beneath the ocean floor. By utilizing
the low-frequency noise produced by the vehicle’s propulsion
system, this technique offers a stealthier and more energyefficient alternative to conventional sonar methods, enabling
continuous and covert subsurface imaging without the need
for active sonar pings or external emitters.


Most approaches for autonomous UUVs aim at detecting a
moving underwater vehicle. Masmitja et al. [4] studied the
optimal path for a mobile robot localizing a static target
with the range-only and single-beacon (ROSB) method, based
on an autonomous vehicle that localizes and tracks different
underwater targets using slant range measurements carried
out with acoustic modems. This approach is an alternative
to more traditional approaches, such as LBL. The simulation
and in-water results for the ROSB method with a wave-glider
determined that a circular USV/target path was optimal.


We tackle this navigation problem using a different approach:
to meet the need for accurate location, it is envisaged to use
external devices – in this case, positioning beacons dropped
by an aerial or surface drone deployed from a drone-carrying
vessel sailing off the coast. The purpose of this constellation
of synthetic landmarks is to mark out an optimal navigation
plan, considering the constraints of the environment and the
means deployed.


Once the path is marked by the beacons, the fleet will direct
itself following the locator beacons, from the initial position
at the limit of the continental shelf to the goal on a beach. We
assume that the locator beacons were deployed by a UAV or
a surface vehicle. They were dropped into the water and can
thus sink to the seafloor, float midwater, or float like a buoy
on the surface, depending on their characteristics. The beacons
emit an acoustic pulse intended to guide UUVs equipped
with a suitable receiver. Finally, the UUVs navigation plan is
generated by a hierarchical planner, that provides a sequence
of primitive actions to follow the marked trajectory. The
hierarchical planning model used will provide the best adapted
course of actions, given the state of the localization of the fleet
of UUVs.


In the paper, we first describe the details of the use case
in Section II, then in Section III we describe the overall
architecture of the framework and detail the hierarchical planning approach to synthesize the navigation plan; Section IV
describes the beacons deployment algorithm developed, and its
planning counterpart, where an automated planner produces a
hierarchical plan for the UUVs to follow the marked path. In
Section V, we discuss the implementation of the algorithms as
a QGIS plugin, and its execution on a simple fleet navigation
example. In Section VI, we conclude and comment on future
developments of this approach.


II. USE CASE


This use case stands on the context of the control of the
underwater domain. It adopts robotic solutions to perform



surveillance and intervention operations. The aim is to increase
the decision-making autonomy of a fleet of unmanned vehicles
and to enhance the robustness of underwater operations, even
without an underwater satellite positioning system and without
immediate access for a carrier vessel.


The main problem in carrying out navigation operations is
the ability for each drone to reach the area of interest and to
be able to position itself precisely given the inherent limits
of submarine communication due to the very nature of the
underwater environment that will affect the beacons signals
and the inter-UUVs communications. As written above, many
environmental hindrances can affect the success of the mission,
namely: the presence of a potentially variable current in
the area of operation, the limited performance of navigation
equipment, the lack of bottom detection at the beginning of the
survey, making it impossible to use a Doppler Velocity Logger
(DVL), the impossibility for underwater drones to surface to
take a GNSS fix, and the extremely limited underwater communications. In order to circumvent these issues, this project
aims at integrating different methodologies from the field of
artificial intelligence with technological solutions implemented
by a fleet of autonomous robots navigating in an unknown
environment.


The localization is provided by a constellation of beacons able
to transmit an acoustic signal up to 2000 m at a very low data
rate (using HF acoustic waves). Each UUV in our scenario
is equipped for navigation with an acoustic modem, a DVL,
an AIS (Automatic Identification system), a camera, GPS, 4G,
and an Inertial Navigation System (INS).


The mission operation carried out by the fleet comprises
reaching a given position using the beacons for localization
support. A UUV can broadcast messages to the fleet and
sense a beacon’s acoustic signal if it is within its range. The
navigation accuracy depends on the availability and usage
of the signals from the beacons, as well as the influence of
environmental factors.


For the first implementation of the navigation framework, and
given the complexity of the problem, we used some strong
assumptions in the model and the uncertainty propagation. In
particular, we use a simplified ocean environment where signal
attenuation due to the different ocean layers is ignored. The
absorption of sound in water increases with frequency, which
limits the distance and bandwidth of submarine communication, and sound waves can also be refracted and scattered
by different ocean layers, temperature gradients, and water
currents. The planning and monitoring are not centralized, but
performed in each UUV, considered as an independent agent.


III. SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE


It is worth describing the overall software architecture of
the planning and execution framework for the fleet of UUVs
(Figure 1), including the beacons deployment plan, before
digging into the single elements of the tool suite.

from the support vessel to the goal along the coastline is

implemented as a QGIS plugin [5], while the navigation
plan representation is implemented as another QGIS plugin
named TraceQGIS, described later in Section V. The beacon
positioning mission is carried out before deploying the fleet,
by aerial or surface drones.


The synthesis of the UUV trajectory is done by an automated hierarchical planner, on the basis of the position of
the beacons. A planner is a software that, given a model of
the environment, solves an automated planning problem and
provides a set of actions to accomplish a task, which in our
case is the UUV fleet mission.


More in general, Automated Planning (also known as AI
Planning) is the branch of semantic Artificial Intelligence
that focuses on the development of strategies or sequences
of actions to achieve specific goals [6]. Within the class of
intelligent autonomous systems, AI planning is the paradigm
that uses a model (of the environment, of the autonomous
agents, . . . ) to perform this decision-making task that is action
selection. A planner, i.e. an automated solver for classes of
mathematical models represented in compact form, provides
as output a set of actions to drive the initial state of the system
into a final, desired, goal state [7]. This approach is typically
used by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned
vehicles.


The automatic synthesis of mission plans for the UUVs
described here are modelled according to the Hierarchical
Task Network (HTN) planning paradigm [8], [9], in order
to break down the mission into elementary tasks, which
allows a rational use of resources, and to generate alternative
decompositions for the same mission task.


Several high level actions are possible: navigating on a course,
sensing a beacon, broadcasting a message.


The navigation trajectory corresponding to the synthetic landmarks is the input of a hierarchical planner.



HTN planning models the AI planning problem as a set of
complex abstract tasks to solve, each one of them broken
down into (possibly different) specific subtasks, down to the
primitive actions. HTN planning has initially been developed
with planners such as NOAH [10], SIPE [11], and UMCP [8].
For totally ordered HTNs, it is possible to plan tasks in the
order they will be executed, and thus to know the current state
of the environment at each step of the planning process.

The HTN planner synthesizes the navigation plan that has
the main objective of guiding the UUVs from beacon to
beacon, until reaching the mission goal. Indeed, the navigation
planning problem is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty:
beacons can be displaced due to ocean currents, intermittent
signal transmission, and UUV trajectory perturbations caused
by subsurface dynamics. Thus, simply adhering to directions
traced by the beacons cannot guarantee a reliable path following. The plan is then executed in a closed loop fashion, where
an execution monitor gathers navigation data to elaborate the
current state of the UUV, providing a continuous assessment
of the state of each element of the fleet. Close-loop plan
execution is a common technique for environments where
unexpected events can occur [12], [13]. If the current state
does not match the state expected on the basis of the known
information about the environment and the initial assumptions,
e.g. a beacon signal is not detected when expected, then a
replanning episode is triggered for all the elements of the
fleet that are in communication range, starting from the current
state and adapted to react to changes in the environment and
hazards of the mission. Note that ideally, replanning should
occur for the whole fleet, but in a distributed environment,
where communication is not guaranteed, such an optimization
is not possible.


IV. BEACONS DEPLOYMENT AND HIERARCHICAL
PLANNING NAVIGATION


The aim of deploying beacons in a given volume of water
is to place them so to maximize the information gathered
by the sensors. The UUV sensors provide a binary response,
indicating whether the beacon signal is detected or not.

Considering a single UUV, the imperfect or unknown information on its current position – due to currents, signal reflection
and scattering, etc. – implies that its position is known within a
certain degree of uncertainty. In a first approximation, in order
to maximize the probability of gathering useful information
during navigation, we minimize the average absolute deviation
between the volume of water where the beacon signal can be
received, and the volume of water where it cannot:



where _Vn_ is the volume of water around each beacon _n_, _N_
is the total number of beacons, and _Vtot_ the total volume of
water under the polygon delimiting the deployment area.

From this consideration, we implemented the Constrained
Lloyd’s algorithm with explicit volume targets equal to _[V]_ _N_ _[tot]_ [,]

where _Vtot_ corresponds to the volume of water below a
polygon initially drawn on a bathymetric map (this quantity
can easily be calculated within QGIS) and that corresponds to
the area where the mission will be executed. The algorithm
iteratively distributes points within the given volume of water,
splitting it in _N_ zones of equal volume. During each iteration
of the algorithm, Lloyd iteration builds a Voronoi map in
which each point is contained within a distinct Voronoi cell,
then centres each point within its cell [14]. The centroid of
each cell corresponds to the beacon’s deployment position.


The result is a set of beacon deployment positions in the
mission area, defined by the polygon that encompasses the
volume _Vtot_ .


_HTN Automated planning_


For the execution of the UUVs mission, we consider synthesizing plans under the Hierarchical Task Network (HTN)
planning paradigm [8]–[10] in a complex marine environment.
This approach allow to use different degrees of granularity to
describe the planning problem.


A key concept in HTN planning is the _task_ . In HTN planning,
we distinguish two kinds of tasks: the primitive tasks (also
called actions), and the abstract tasks (or compound tasks).
Primitive tasks are carried out by actions in the sense of
classical planning [15], while abstract tasks can be refined by
applying methods that define the decomposition of the task
into subtasks. The purpose of abstract tasks is not to induce a
state transition, while actions do change the state of the world.
Instead, abstract tasks refer to a predefined mapping to one or
more tasks that can refine the abstract task. For instance, in



the task of serving a dinner, _deliver-dinner(?food-style, ?place)_
is the compound task consisting in performing first the task
of serving the starters, then the main course, etc. In that
sense, _deliver-dinner(?food-style, ?place)_ can be refined in:
_⟨serve-starters(?food-style, ?place)_, _serve-main-course(?food-_
_style, ?place)_, etc. _⟩_

Let us first define the planning domain and problem for HTN
Planning. A _planning domain D_ is a tuple ( _L, T, J, α, A, M_ ),
where _L_ is the first-order logic language, _T_ is the set of tasks,
_J_ is the set of task identifiers [1], _α_ : _J →T_ is the function
that maps task identifiers to tasks, _A_ is a set of actions, _M_ is
the set of methods. The domain implicitly defines the set of
all states _S_, defined over all subsets of all ground predicates
in _L_ .

Tasks are connected together in HTN planning by task networks (TNs). A TN is given by the pair - _{ni}i,_ Φ�, i.e. an
ordered set of task identifiers _ni ∈J_ and the constraints Φ
on those tasks. This mapping between tasks is achieved by a
set of decomposition methods; a method is then defined by
the pair _{t, w}_, with _t ∈T_ the task it decomposes, and _w_ the
task network defining the decomposition into sub-tasks.
A _planning problem P_ is a tuple ( _D, s_ 0 _, w_ 0 _, g_ ), where _D_ is
a planning domain, _s_ 0 _∈_ _S_ is the initial state, _w_ 0 is the
initial task network, and _g_ is a formula (not necessary ground)
describing the goal.

The HTN planning approach is particularly effective in scenarios where tasks must be dynamically decomposed into


1Task identifiers are arbitrary symbols, which serve as place holders for
the actual tasks they represent. Identifiers are needed because tasks can occur
multiple times within the same task network, as we will see below.

(c) UUV 1 broadcasts to the fleet. (d) UUV 1 navigates towards beacon 8.

differing sets of subtasks, depending on the current state and
problem constraints. Temporal dynamics, however, are not natively modelled. Being able to represent hierarchical domains
with time constraints is central for the execution of collaborative robotic missions in complex environments as it includes
in the solution provided the necessary synchronization and
coordination time points for the fleet. Currently, there is no
language for hierarchical planning with temporal constraints
that is widely accepted as a standard within the community.
Nevertheless, we propose here to adopt an early version of
HDDL2.1 [16] – a 2023 syntax and semantic framework for
describing Temporal HTN problems – which we intend to
evolve further to meet our expressivity requirements. As a
first step, we express the planning problem in an untimed
HDDL 1.0 model [17], developing it further to include time
constraints in HDDL 2.1. It is worth noting that few planners
operate under this paradigm, and the development of such
planner would in itself advance the state of the art.



V. IMPLEMENTATION


All the elements of the software toolchain have been implemented as QGIS extensions; QGIS (Quantum Geographic
Information System) is a free, open-source software that
allows users to create, edit, visualize, analyse, and publish
geospatial information. [5].


The algorithm implementing the deployment solution for the
beacons helping the underwater localization of the fleet of
UUVs can be easily implemented with A* search.


For the HTN planner, an off-the-shelf planner can be used
to provide a hierarchical plan for the fleet, e.g. SHOP2 [18],
or the more recent PANDA [19]. A Temporal HTN planner to
include temporal constraints in the navigation plan is currently
under development.


The plugin TraceQGIS permits to load model files describing
the HTN planning problem (in the HDDL language [16], [17]),
and a configuration file (in YAML format) describing the
visual interface, e.g. the icons used. All entities participating


in the mission (the beacons and the UUVs), their trajectories,
and the ongoing communication are visualised in the QGIS
interface in separate layers, namely _Entity, Communication,_
_Trace Movements_ (see Figure 2).


A simple scenario is used here to illustrate the capabilities of
TraceQGIS with our approach for GNSS-denied underwater
navigation. The mission consists in having a UUV, which
initial position is uncertain, to navigate to beacon 8 and to
broadcast a message half way between the 5 deployed beacons.
The initial situation is illustrated in Figure 2: the 5 beacons
are deployed in the mission area, while the 5 UUVs are
“between the beacons”, with some uncertainty about their
position. Beacon no. 6 is emitting an acoustic signal.


UUV no. 1 navigates towards the supposed position of beacon
no. 6 (Fig. 3a), until it receives its acoustic signature (Fig. 3b).
It then circles the beacon to localise itself precisely, and then
broadcasts the message to the fleet (Fig. 3c). The message is
received by the other UUVs, which then navigate towards the
broadcasting position, while UUV no. 1 continues following
its path to beacon no. 8 (Fig. 3d).


In the figures, the bathymetry data are downloaded from
the Service hydrographique et oc´eanographique de la marine
(SHOM) [20].


VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK


We have presented an alternative solution for enabling stealthy
underwater navigation operations using a fleet of autonomous
UUVs. The proposed approach involves first generating an
optimal deployment plan for marine acoustic beacons, accounting for challenges deriving from submarine operations.
The beacons signal a navigation path, which the UUVs then
follow via a sequence of actions synthesized by a hierarchical
planner. Continuous monitoring the plan execution allows to
adaptive replan in response to environmental perturbations,
in order to dynamically adjust the plan based on real-time
fleet state data, including positional estimates, beacon pose
uncertainty, and the signals gathered during the navigation,
reinforcing the robustness of the proposed solution.


Some aspects of the approach are left for future work. The fleet
coordination has not been considered in the first navigation
model, assuming a parallel and independent navigation for
the UUVs. In the future, the inherent limits of submarine
communication affecting the beacons signals and the interUUVs communications must be taken into account for a
better solution. In fact, the unknown underwater target position
problem can be solved using trilateration [21], using UUVs
following different trajectories and inter-UUV communication
to compute in real time an estimate of the ranges between the
UUVs and simultaneously localize the beacons.
