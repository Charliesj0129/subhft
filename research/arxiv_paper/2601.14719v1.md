**Abstract**


Permanent lunar settlements will rely on in situ oxygen production from regolith for life support and propulsion.
While oxygen is abundant in lunar materials, it is chemically bound within metal oxides whose extractability
depends strongly on regolith composition and processing strategy. In this study, we validate and characterize
high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants representative of the lunar highlands and south pole using scanning
electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
surface area and pore structure analysis, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. The simulants
exhibit strong mineralogical and compositional fidelity to returned Apollo and Chang’e samples, with ilmenite
confirmed as the most readily reducible oxygen-bearing phase. However, despite low ilmenite abundance,
bulk highland simulants display favorable reduction behavior arising from distributed Fe-bearing silicate
and glassy phases, as well as surface and microstructural properties that influence gas-solid interactions.
Adsorption experiments with gases (H2, CH4, and CO2) and water indicate that mineralogical heterogeneity
and pore accessibility influence their uptake in simulants. These results indicate that oxygen extraction
behavior in realistic lunar regolith is governed by whole-regolith response rather than ilmenite content alone,
supporting the option of whole-regolith processing strategies for oxygen production in lunar in situ resource
utilization architectures.

**1. Introduction**


As global interest in establishing sustained lunar
presence increases, the development of robust in situ
resource utilization (ISRU) strategies becomes essential. Among all in situ resources, oxygen is of primary
importance, both for life support and as an oxidizer
for propulsion systems. The Moon contains abundant

oxygen, approximately 45 wt% in returned Apollo
samples, primarily bound within minerals such as
ilmenite, olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase Sibille
(2020). However, oxygen is not readily accessible and
must be liberated through energy-intensive chemical
or electrochemical processes D. Green and Kleinhenz
(2019). Consequently, the feasibility of oxygen production on the Moon depends strongly on regolith
composition, mineralogy, and the selection of appropriate extraction pathways.


Lunar regolith is commonly classified into mare


and highland types, reflecting the Moon’s major geological terrains. Mare regolith is basaltic and relatively enriched in ilmenite, making it well suited
for hydrogen reduction-based oxygen extraction approaches Sargeant et al. (2020b). In contrast, highland regolith, dominant across much of the lunar
surface and particularly relevant to polar regions, is
feldspathic, anorthosite-rich, and typically contains
very low ilmenite abundances Slabic et al. (2024);
McKay et al. (1991). As a result, oxygen extraction strategies that rely exclusively on ilmenite reduction may be poorly suited for highland and polar
deployments, motivating increased interest in alternative approaches such as molten regolith electrolysis,
plasma-assisted extraction, and whole-regolith processing schemes Schreiner (2015). Recent analyses of
returned Apollo and Chang’e-5 samples have further
highlighted the mineralogical complexity and heterogeneity of lunar regolith. Apollo highland soils are
dominated by plagioclase and commonly contain less
than 2 vol% ilmenite even in fine fractions Taylor
et al. (2010), while Chang’e-5 samples, though collected from a mare region, include highland clasts rich
in calcic plagioclase and magnesian mafic minerals
Wang (2022). These findings underscore that oxygen
extraction systems must contend with mixed mineral
assemblages rather than idealized, ilmenite-rich feedstocks. In response, a new generation of high-fidelity
lunar regolith simulants has been developed to better reproduce the mineralogical and physicochemical
properties of specific lunar terrains Zou et al. (2024);
Sun et al. (2017). Earlier simulants were often discontinued, lacked sufficient fidelity, or were unsuitable
for advanced ISRU testing, particularly in the context of oxygen extraction and additive manufacturing
Isachenkov et al. (2022).
Beyond serving as geological analogs, high-fidelity
simulants provide a practical platform for evaluating
how regolith composition, microstructure, and surface
properties influence gas-solid interactions, reducibility,
and volatile handling under ISRU-relevant conditions.
In this context, the key question is not only whether
a simulant matches lunar composition, but what it
reveals about feasible oxygen extraction strategies for
regions where ilmenite is scarce.
In this study, we validate and characterize the lunar



highland simulants LHS-1 and LHS-2, as well as the
lunar south pole simulant LSP-2, using SEM-EDX,
XRD, BET surface area and pore structure analysis, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR). By combining chemical, structural, and textural characterization with reduction and adsorption
measurements, we assess the extent to which wholeregolith processing can support oxygen extraction
behavior despite low ilmenite content. Our results
indicate that bulk highland simulants, particularly
LHS-2, exhibit favorable gas-solid interaction and reduction behavior arising from distributed Fe-bearing
silicate and glassy phases, rather than ilmenite alone.
These findings inform the selection and optimization
of oxygen extraction pathways for highland and polar ISRU architectures, where feedstock realism and
system robustness are critical.


**2. Materials and Methods**


This study utilizes high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants produced by Exolith to accurately represent
distinct soil types from the south pole (LSP-2) and
highlands (LHS-1 and LHS-2) regions of the Moon
Easter et al. (2024); Long-Fox et al. (2023). In this
study, all references to LHS-1, LHS-2, and LSP-2 refer
to this manufacturer’s product.
The phase compositions of the simulants used are
reported in Table 1 Space Resource Technologies
(2023a,b,c). It should be noted that LHS-1 and LHS-2
are compositionally similar. The simulants differ in
particle size: LHS-1 averages 100 µm, whereas LHS-2
is 60 µm. Pyroxene may be referred to as bronzite in
Exolith specifications.

To characterize the simulants, scanning electron
microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(SEM-EDX) was used to examine particle size, morphology, and surface topology. This was conducted
with the _ThermoFisher_ Phenom-XL Desktop SEM
with an integrated EDX detector.
As shown in Figure 1, SEM-EDX mapping was used
to visualize elemental distributions as color-mapped
signal intensities. Carbon and gold signals are artifacts arising from the conductive mounting tape
and sputter-coating process, respectively, and are not
intrinsic to the simulant material. Excluding these
artifacts, EDX mapping identifies six major elements
within the simulant grains: O, Si, K, Mg, Al, and Ca.
The SEM-EDX maps reveal pronounced mineralogical heterogeneity at the grain scale, with oxygen-rich
silicate and glassy matrices surrounding discrete Mgand Al-rich grains. Large, compositionally continuous
ilmenite domains are not observed at this scale, indicating that Fe- and Ti-bearing phases, where present,
are likely fine-grained and spatially dispersed. The
predominantly angular grain morphology and the presence of intergranular voids, rather than internal grain
porosity, are qualitatively consistent with the low
BET surface area and mesopore-scale pore sizes measured for the bulk simulants. This heterogeneous and
dispersed phase distribution further aligns with the
broad, multi-step reduction behavior observed during
hydrogen TPR, discussed in Section 3.2.
To further verify mineralogical composition, particularly for phases that may be present below SEMEDX detection limits, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis was conducted on untreated samples of LHS1, LHS-2, and LSP-2 simulants, alongside their constituent components, using a _Malvern Panalytical_
diffractometer configured for high-resolution phase
identification.
XRD results were recorded over a 2 _θ_ range of 5 _[◦]_

to 85 _[◦]_ on the as-received powders. Raw diffraction
profiles were processed using _X’Pert HighScore_, employing background subtraction and K- _α_ 2 stripping
algorithms prior to peak fitting, mineral phase identification, and comparative analysis across simulant compositions. Apollo 16 sample #64501 (from Ref. Taylor
et al. (2019)) was employed as a benchmark for highland regolith composition in both LHS-1 and LHS-2.



All patterns were corrected for zero-point displacement by applying a constant 2 _θ_ offset to account for
instrument drift during peak comparison Hulbert and
Kriven (2023).
Upon verifying the fidelity of the simulants,
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was used to
assess surface area properties of LHS-2 and its constituent minerals. A _Micromeritics 3Flex_ Surface Analyzer was used to perform N2 adsorption–desorption
at 77 K. Prior to measurement, samples were activated
for 12 hours at 200 _[◦]_ C under high vacuum. LHS-1 was
not included in BET analysis as it is compositionally
similar to LHS-2. The latter’s smaller particle size
already lends to greater surface area exposure, corresponding to enhanced gas adsorption. Furthermore,
gas–solid interaction experiments with CO2, N2, H2,
and CH4 were conducted at 25 _[◦]_ C and up to 1 bar, as
well as water adsorption isotherms of the materials
measured at 25 _[◦]_ C and 100% RH.
Finally, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
using a _Micromeritics AutoChem_ was performed to
characterize chemical interactions between solids and
reacting gases, quantifying the strength of solidoxygen interactions. In hydrogen TPR samples were
pretreated under flowing Ar for 1 hour, starting from
ambient to a peak temperature of 300 °C reached in
10 minutes. The samples consisted of two simulant
mixtures (LHS-2, LSP-2) and their respective phases
(ilmenite and olivine). The samples were all reduced
at 900 °C. Moreover, in the context of oxygen extraction, it should be noted that ilmenite reduction
is consistently identified as one of the most efficient
and straightforward methods for oxygen extraction
Sargeant et al. (2020b); Ramachandran et al. (2006),
and thus TPR results for these ilmenite-containing
simulants are expected to produce a similar finding.


**3. Results and Discussion**


The primary objective of validating simulants is
to confirm mineralogical fidelity and simultaneously
determine how their properties influence oxygen extraction behaviour and potential efficiency. Elemental
mapping (SEM-EDX) and phase identification (XRD)
establish baseline fidelity of the simulants. BET and

capture.


_3.1. Simulant Validation Outcomes_


Alongside an overall map of the elemental composition of LHS-2 and LSP-2, SEM-EDX can filter out
respective maps of the individual elements present in
each simulant. As seen in Figure 2, the EDX Elemental Map shows large quantities of Si and O in LHS-2,
and that these two elements are likely bonded as
they are present in the same phases. Silicon and oxygen being dominant elements reflects the prevalence
of anorthosite and basalt (SiO2). This composition
aligns with the mineralogical framework of lunar regolith, which is dominated by feldspathic and basaltic
lithologies Mckay and Ming (1990); Zhang et al.
(2021). Anorthosites, forming the primary highland
crust, consist mainly of Ca-rich plagioclase (An9397) with minor mafic phases, originating through
fractional crystallization and buoyant rise during Lunar Magma Ocean solidification Wakita and Schmitt
(1970); Pernet-Fisher et al. (2017). In contrast, mare
basalts represent mantle-derived melts enriched in pyroxene and ilmenite, exhibiting higher FeO and TiO2
contents, as documented in Apollo petrographic studies Isaacson et al. (2011) and recent Chang’e basalt
analyses Yin et al. (2025). We confirmed the ilmenite



presence in LHS-1 and LHS-2 through XRD phase
identification and found it to be consistent with the
reported simulant composition, despite its low overall
abundance.
Thus preliminarily, SEM-EDX indicates that the
elemental profile of LHS-2 provides a good match to
lunar highlands regolith, supporting its suitability as
a simulant for testing towards ISRU.
Figure 3 also presents the EDX Elemental Maps
for LSP-2, revealing a consistent concentration of
silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) within identical phases.
These elemental distributions confirm the presence of
basalt and anorthosite, consistent with the mineralogical mixed feldspathic-basaltic composition observed
in the South Pole-Aitken basin Zhang et al. (2025).
Moreover, recent analyses from the Chang’e-6 mission indicate that the regolith in this region consists
of approximately 93% local mare basalt, with minor
contributions from highland anorthositic and mantlederived materials Cui et al. (2024).
To verify the qualitative results of the imaging, Table 2 presents the EDX-derived elemental concentrations for LHS-2 and LSP-2. As expected, both materials exhibit high levels of oxygen and silicon, consistent
with the silicate-rich nature of lunar regolith. Oxygen
dominates in both samples ( _∼_ 74 at.%), reflecting
its role as a major component in oxides and silicate
minerals Robinot et al. (2025). This also aligns with

the initially reported composition provided by the
simulant manufacturer, as shown in Table 1.
LHS-2 shows a notably high silicon content (16.4
at.%, 23.8 wt%), which aligns well with the mineralogy
of lunar highland soils, where plagioclase feldspar and



pyroxene are prevalent Taylor (1972). This composition is again comparable to retrieved regolith samples.
In contrast, LSP-2 displays ample aluminium levels
(17.8 at.%, 25.9 wt%), suggesting presence of aluminosilicate phases common in lunar highland materials.
Lower silicon concentrations in LSP-2 (4.8 at.%, 6.7
wt%) mimicking feldspathic lunar terrains.
Minor amounts of calcium, potassium, and magnesium are present in LHS-2, and the latter two are
absent or below detection in LSP-2. These variations
are within the expected range and reflect the diversity of regolith compositions observed across different
lunar regions Mckay and Ming (1990).
Overall, SEM-EDX both qualitatively and quantitatively suggests that LHS-2 and LSP-2 have wellaligned elemental profiles with lunar regolith, supporting the use of high-fidelity simulants for ISRU
research. Additional details of the SEM–EDX characterization of the individual minerals can be found in
the Appendix.
As in Figure 4, XRD of the as-received powders enabled comparison of LHS-1 diffraction profiles against
lunar-relevant minerals, including anorthosite, basalt,
ilmenite, olivine, and pyroxene. LHS-1 (green) shows
strongly-overlapping peaks with anorthosite (orange)
and pyroxene (cyan), indicating significant presence
of plagioclase and pyroxene phases which are indeed
dominant in lunar highland regolith McKay et al.
(1991). Sample 64501 (black) from the Apollo 16
mission shows substantial overlap, with minor deviations likely attributable to factors such as particle size
distribution and crystallite effects Li et al. (2022).

(bottom), and their constituent minerals.


The middle panel illustrates the mineralogical profile of LHS-2. Its diffraction pattern (green) similarly
aligns closely with anorthosite (orange) and pyroxene (cyan), confirming the presence of plagioclase and
pyroxene phases consistent with lunar highland materials. Minor peak overlaps with ilmenite, olivine,
and basalt suggest trace amounts of Fe-Ti oxides and
mafic silicates, further supporting the simulant’s fidelity Robinot et al. (2025). The resulting patterns
for LHS-1 and LHS-2 exhibit strong correspondence
in peak positions and relative intensities with Apollo
16, confirming their high mineralogical fidelity.
Finally, the bottom XRD pattern in Figure 4 com


pares the diffraction profile of LSP-2 (purple) with
those of anorthosite (orange) and basalt (blue), two
key mineralogical components of lunar regolith. The
strong peak alignment between LSP-2 and anorthosite
suggests a dominant presence of plagioclase feldspar,
characteristic of lunar highland materials. Additionally, the overlap with basalt indicates the inclusion of
mafic phases, typical of mare regions Salem et al..


_3.2. Oxygen-Bearing Phases and Reduction Behavior_


_3.2.1. Hydrogen TPR Reduction Behavior_
Ilmenite (FeTiO3) emerges as the most efficient
oxygen source among lunar minerals, delivering an
apparent yield of 1.10 wt% oxygen under hydrogen
reduction conditions. This result is aligned with work
by NASA’s Applied Chemistry Laboratory Muscatello
(2017) and more recently the ProSPA custom setup by
Sargeant et al. Sargeant et al. (2020a) as well as Reiss
et al. Reiss et al. (2019), all of which demonstrated
ilmenite-rich regolith yields up to 1-2 wt% oxygen via
hydrogen reduction at 900 °C, following the reaction:


FeTiO3 + H2 _→_ Fe + TiO2 + H2O (1)


This validates ilmenite as the most efficient known
oxygen source and supports the use of high-fidelity
simulants for research purposes. The reported weight
percentages fall within the range documented in prior
literature Sargeant et al. (2020b).
The corresponding TPR profiles for LHS, LSP, and
ilmenite are illustrated in Figure 5. The observed
reduction behavior in TPR is consistent with the
presence of reducible Fe-Ti oxides such as ilmenite
identified by XRD, even at low bulk concentrations.
Among the mineralogical constituents of lunar regolith, Lunar Highlands Soil (LHS) emerges as a practical secondary source for in situ oxygen production
due to its widespread distribution across the lunar
surface. This is despite its low oxygen yield of approximately 0.02 wt% inferred from TPR, the volumetric
prevalence of LHS may compensate for its limited
extraction efficiency. In addition, the Lunar South
Pole (LSP) simulant exhibited an oxygen extraction
of 0.01 wt%. These values were obtained via TPR by
baseline-correcting the TCD signal, integrating it over

the reduction interval, and converting the area to oxygen quantity using a calibrated response normalized
by sample mass.
Although TPR is widely used for catalyst characterization and oxygen quantification, the technique has
inherent limitations Dabbawala et al. (2023). Baseline drift in thermal conductivity detectors can distort signal interpretation, while gas-composition crosssensitivities may interfere with accurate hydrogen detection during TPR measurements Munteanu et al.
(2008). Variations in heating rate strongly influence
peak resolution and reduction profiles. Moreover, the
reduction kinetics are highly influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of the material, particularly
factors such as particle size, crystallite dimensions,
and specific surface area Baysal et al. (2021).
It is also important to note that the reduction pathway using hydrogen (H2) produces water (H2O) as
an intermediate, rather than gaseous oxygen directly.
While this introduces an additional processing step,
water electrolysis, to liberate breathable O2, it also
presents a strategic advantage. Water is a dual-use



resource: it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen
for rocket fuel (LH2/LOX), and used directly for life
support, agriculture, and radiation shielding Sargeant
et al. (2020b); Wang et al. (2025). Moreover, the hydrogen used in the reduction reaction can be recycled
from the electrolysis step, enabling a closed-loop process that conserves hydrogen – a critical consideration
given its scarcity on the Moon Tewes et al. (2020).
Water is also easier to store, transport, and handle than gaseous oxygen, especially in cryogenic or
pressurized systems. However, electrolysis can be
power-demanding, as reduced gravity conditions have
been shown to lower its efficiency and potentially limit
its practicality within a mission’s available energy resource Burke et al. (2024). The choice between this
method and a direct oxygen extraction process (e.g.,
molten regolith electrolysis) will therefore depend on
the specific mission architecture, available energy, and
the desired product portfolio Guerrero-Gonzalez and
Zabel (2023); Schreiner (2015).


_3.2.2. Textural Properties and Gas-Solid Accessibility_
Beyond chemical reducibility, physical and surface
properties also influence gas-solid interactions relevant
to oxygen extraction. Table 3 summarizes the textural
properties of the lunar regolith simulants measured by
N2 adsorption-desoprtion isotherm at 77 K. Ilmenite
exhibits the highest specific surface area (3.195 m [2] /g)
and mesopore-scale average pore size (21.05 nm), indicating comparatively high surface accessibility for
gas-solid interactions. While BET-derived surface
area and pore metrics do not directly predict oxide
oxygen yield, they provide useful descriptors of sur

face accessibility and transport pathways that can
influence gas-solid reaction kinetics, particularly during early reaction stages or under conditions where
surface access is rate-limiting Bui et al. (2022).
Anorthosite and pyroxene exhibit relatively low
surface areas (0.572 and 0.388 m²/g, respectively)
with large average pore sizes ( _∼_ 135 nm), indicating a greater fraction of pore volume in larger voids
rather than high internal surface area. Basalt and
LHS-2 show similarly low surface areas (0.599 and
0.349 m²/g, respectively); notably, LHS-2 exhibits
mesopore-scale average pore size (26.83 nm) despite
its low BET area, consistent with limited accessible internal surface area in the bulk simulant due
to aggregation, pore blocking, or packing effects in
mixed-phase powders. Olivine exhibits intermediate
textural properties (1.056 m²/g; 40.68 nm), consistent with moderate surface accessibility relative to
the other silicate phases.


_3.2.3. Gas Adsorption Behavior and ISRU-Relevant_
_Implications_
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure 6)
reveal distinct adsorption behaviors among the simulants, indicating that factors beyond specific surface
area (i.e., surface chemistry, activation state, pore
structure accessibility and distribution differences),
play an important role in determining gas affinity
Ma et al. (2025). Such behavior is relevant for ISRU
concepts involving non-thermal plasma processing,
volatile capture under vacuum conditions, and intermediate gas-handling steps following reduction or

electrolysis, where gas-solid interactions can influence
process performance.
Collectively, these results indicate that while ilmenite remains the most reactive phase for chemical
reduction processes, LHS-2 may offer advantages in
adsorption- or capture-relevant contexts due to its
mineralogical complexity and pore-structure characteristics under ISRU-relevant conditions Petkov et al.
(2024).
Selectivity values reported in Table 4 correspond to
simple uptake ratios ( _q_ CO2 _/q_ gas) derived from singlecomponent adsorption at 1 bar and 25 _[◦]_ C, rather than
thermodynamic or mixture-based selectivities.
LHS-2 exhibits the highest absolute CO2 uptake (0.044 mmol/g), slightly exceeding anorthosite
(0.042 mmol/g), despite having a comparatively low
BET surface area. This indicates that CO2 adsorption
in LHS-2 is governed primarily by surface chemistry
and microstructural heterogeneity rather than surface
area alone. In contrast, anorthosite displays the highest CO2/N2 uptake ratio, which arises from very low
N2 adsorption rather than exceptionally high CO2
capacity. Basalt similarly shows elevated CO2/N2
ratios driven by limited N2 uptake. Ilmenite exhibits
low CO2 uptake combined with comparatively higher
N2 adsorption, resulting in low CO2/N2 selectivity,
consistent with its limited affinity toward CO2 under
these conditions. Additional gas adsorption isotherm
results at 25 _[◦]_ C and pressures up to 1 bar for CH4,
N2, H2, and CO2 on the simulants are provided in
the Appendix.
LHS-2 shows moderate CO2 selectivity over N2, H2,

and CH4, reflecting high absolute adsorption capacity
accompanied by relatively non-discriminatory uptake
of multiple gases. This behavior is consistent with its
mineralogical complexity and heterogeneous surface
chemistry, which favor multi-gas adsorption rather
than strong molecular selectivity.
Adsorption of H2 and CH4 is generally low across
most samples; however, pyroxene exhibits comparatively high H2 uptake and moderate CH4 adsorption,
suggesting that its pore structure or surface chemistry
preferentially accommodates smaller gas molecules
under these measurement conditions.

the materials at 25 °C up to 100% relative humidity.


**4. Conclusion and Recommendations**


This study validates and characterizes high-fidelity
lunar regolith simulants representative of the lunar
highlands and south polar regions, with the objective
of informing oxygen extraction strategies under realistic ISRU conditions. Combined XRD and SEM-EDX
analyses confirm that the mineralogical and elemental
profiles of the LHS-1, LHS-2, and LSP-2 simulants
are broadly representative of returned Apollo and
Chang’e samples, supporting their use as experimental analogs for lunar regolith in laboratory-scale ISRU
studies.
Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction confirms ilmenite as the most readily reducible oxygenbearing phase, consistent with prior work. However,
a key finding of this study is that bulk highland simulants, particularly LHS-2, exhibit favorable appar


ent oxygen release and gas-solid interaction behavior despite low ilmenite abundance. This behavior
arises from the collective contribution of distributed
Fe-bearing silicate and glassy phases, as well as surface
and microstructural properties that influence reduction and adsorption processes. These results indicate
that oxygen extraction behavior in realistic lunar regolith is governed by whole-regolith response rather
than ilmenite content alone.

BET and gas adsorption analyses show that individual mineral phases have low surface areas, with
ilmenite offering high accessibility but limited CO2
affinity and silicate gas uptake not scaling with surface area. These results highlight the importance of
mineralogical complexity and microstructural heterogeneity in governing gas–solid interactions relevant
to ISRU processing. In this context, whole-regolith
processing approaches may offer advantages in system
simplicity and robustness compared to strategies relying on extensive mineral beneficiation, particularly for
lunar highland and polar deployments where ilmenite
is scarce Shaw et al. (2022).

A key limitation of current simulants, as well as
returned lunar samples, is their inability to fully
replicate the space-weathered lunar surface, which
is shaped by solar wind irradiation, micrometeoroid
bombardment, and volatile retention L. Vander Wal
(2008); Denevi et al. (2023). Addressing these effects
will be essential for further improving the fidelity of
ISRU testing, with ultimate validation requiring in
situ experimentation on the lunar surface.

Based on these findings, we recommend several
priorities for future research: (i) integrating bulk


9


regolith oxygen extraction behavior with reactor-scale
and system-level analyses to assess process performance and operational trade-offs; (ii) developing
next-generation simulants that incorporate spaceweathering effects informed by data from lunar polar
missions; and (iii) employing high-fidelity simulants
to evaluate emerging ISRU approaches, such as nonthermal plasma-based methods Alhemeiri et al. (2024),
alongside continued optimization of established processes including ilmenite reduction Zou et al. (2024).
In addition, further investigation of the mineralogical
and textural properties of lunar regolith may clarify
its potential catalytic or kinetic role in facilitating gassolid reactions relevant to future ISRU applications
Zhong et al. (2023).
In summary, while no simulant can fully reproduce
the lunar environment, this study demonstrates the
value of high-fidelity regolith analogs for bridging laboratory experimentation and lunar ISRU system design.
The insights gained, particularly regarding the role
