**Abstract**


The launch of $Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates
the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread
popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not
a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative
bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets’ future performance,
and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively
understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted
tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more
pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack
sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.
To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multiagent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure
of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve
them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading
knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable
decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects’ transaction
data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent
system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and
single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying highquality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets,
respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit
of $500,000 across these projects.

**1** **Introduction**


While manipulative tactics such as rat trading are well-trodden
ruses in traditional financial markets, these old-fashioned ploys
have now become bot-driven and prey on naïve copy traders in a
new hunting ground: the memecoin market.
The launch of $TRUMP memecoin by U.S. President Trump on
January 17, 2025, ignited a surge of speculation in the memecoin
market, drawing millions of traders to the memecoin market. However, many of these entrants lack prior trading experience. To lower
the barrier to participation, memecoin-tracking platforms such as
GMGN introduced copy trading, an automated, one-click feature
that allows users to replicate other wallets. In practice, copiers
attempt to identify so-called key opinion leader (KOL) wallets—
addresses perceived to possess insider knowledge, trading expertise, and consistent profitability—and replicate their trades. As a
strategy-agnostic approach, copy trading eliminates the need for indepth market knowledge and has rapidly become the most popular
strategy among inexperienced memecoin traders.
However, copy trading is neither risk-free nor a guaranteed
path to profit. Copiers face several challenges, most notably the
prevalence of various manipulative bots that can conceal their
positions, snipe trades, engage in wash trading, and falsify social
media signals. Another major challenge lies in selecting the right
KOL wallet. Some KOLs featured on tracking platforms may exploit
their influence by buying meme coins early at low prices, prompting
copiers to follow and inflate the price, then exiting at a profit—
using copiers as exit liquidity. In such cases, copiers may end up
buying high and selling low, resulting in losses. Another challenge
is performance persistence: KOLs who were successful in the past
may underperform as market dynamics shift, particularly with the
rise of new manipulative trading bots. Moreover, meme coin values
are typically driven by hype and vulnerable to pump-and-dump
schemes, meaning even skilled KOLs can suffer loss. To maximize

returns, copiers should be selective, targeting meme coins with
higher upward potential and longer life expectancy.
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed
the financial sector, offering powerful tools for meme investment.
Numerous studies have highlighted the strong capability of LLMs to
process and learn from multi-modal data [16], including text [7, 15]
and images [17], making them well-suited for analyzing meme coin
markets and evaluating KOL performance across various data types.
In addition, their natural language generation capabilities [8, 12]
enable them to produce explainable investment decisions. However,
the performance of standalone LLMs in financial tasks remains
limited, due to the complexity and reasoning demands of the domain [5, 14]. These limitations are even more pronounced in meme
coin markets, where domain-specific training data is scarce. To
address this, recent research has proposed decomposing complex
tasks into subtasks handled by multiple specialized LLM-based
agents [11, 13]. Inspired by human cognitive processes, this multiagent approach enhances reasoning and problem-solving by enabling collaboration among agents, each focusing on a specific
aspect of the task. While some studies have explored such agentbased systems in stock or high-cap cryptocurrency markets [1, 2, 6],
no prior work has applied them to meme coin investment.
To address these challenges and fill the gap, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for meme coin copy
trading. Inspired by task specialization in hedge funds, the framework decomposes the trading process into four subtasks—meme
coin evaluation, trader assessment, wealth management, and order
execution—each handled by a dedicated agent.
The meme evaluation agent identifies meme coins with strong
growth potential and long-term viability. The trader evaluation
agent selects KOL wallets based on their historical trading performance. The trader evaluation agent selects KOL wallets based
on historical trading performance. The meme evaluation agent
identifies high-potential, long-lived meme coins using candlestick
patterns, trading metrics, and comment sentiment. The wealth management agent allocates capital across copy trading opportunities,
while the order execution agent is responsible for submitting buy
orders on Pumpfun. Finally, the order execution agent is responsible
for submitting buy orders on PumpFun.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we use the
data of 4,000 meme coin projects to evaluate the performance of our
multi-agent model. Our framework not only outperforms single
LLM but also produce economically significant profits. The main
contribution of this paper is summarized as:


 - We are the first to propose an algorithm for detecting manipulative bots. Using the signals generated by this algorithm, even
the traditional machine learning models demonstrate predictive
power in identifying KOLs.

 - We are the first to propose a systematic framework for meme
coin copy trading. Our framework outperforms not only traditional machine learning models but also single LLMs in both
KOL and high-quality meme selection by integrating multimodal
data, generating economically significant profits.

 - Inspired by the decision-making processes of professional meme
coin traders, we implement chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting



for each agent to facilitate learning of expert-level strategies for
evaluating meme coins and traders and ensure the explainability.

 - Our multi-agent model integrates multi-modal financial data—
including text and visual information—into the decision-making
process, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and enhancing overall performance.


**2** **Related Works**


This section reviews prior work on using single LLMs and multiagent frameworks in investment tasks. Owing to their strong language understanding and reasoning abilities, LLMs have been widely
adopted for financial applications. Early efforts centered on employing single LLMs to forecast asset prices and implement investment
strategies. Some studies developed domain-specific financial LLMs
through fine-tuning [5, 9, 14], while others evaluated LLM performance in trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
Solana [6]. However, even fine-tuned single-agent models often
yield limited predictive power and exhibit significant bias.
To address these shortcomings, recent research has turned to
multi-agent systems. For example, the Summarize-Explain-Predict
(SEP) framework uses a reflective agent that iteratively generates
forecasts and explanations with support from auxiliary agents [3].
Other studies leverage multiple agents to handle data processing,
summarization, reflection, and prediction tasks [1, 2, 4]. Luo et al.

[10] introduce a multi-agent LLM-based system for managing largecap cryptocurrency portfolios. Despite these advancements, there
is limited work on multi-agent, multi-modal models tailored to
low-cap cryptocurrency investment. To bridge this gap, we propose a specialized multi-agent framework where distinct agents
process different modalities and collaborate to invest in a universe
of emerging cryptocurrencies.


**3** **Background**


In this section, we introduce the concept of meme coin, Pumpfun’s
business model, key players, and market manipulation dynamic on
that platform.


**3.1** **Meme Coin and Pump.fun**


A meme coin is a cryptocurrency that originates from internet
memes, typically characterized by low liquidity and volatile price
driven by community hype, social media trends, and celebrity endorsements. Pump.fun, the largest meme coin crowdfunding platform on Solana, lets users create meme coins for free.
First, users can upload an image and select a name and ticker, and
Pumpfun will use this information to create a new token (so-called
meme coin) via a standard smart contract on blockchain with a total
supply of 1 billion. Immediately afterward, the creator can choose
whether to purchase the token at the lowest available price. Of
the total supply, 800 million tokens are made available for trading,
while 200 million remain locked. This is similar to the Initial Public
Offerings (IPO) application stage in the stock market, but with no
extremely simple prospectus and no regulatory approval.
Next, the meme coin enters the “launching stage”. It will be
displayed on Pumpfun’s front page and open to subscription. At
this stage, the creator and other traders could buy or sell 800 million
meme coins at a designated price from or to the contract. The

price of meme coin and the SOL deposited as follows:




_[𝑑𝑥]_

_𝑑𝑦_ [=][ −(] _[𝑥]_ [+] _𝑘_ _[ 𝑥]_ [′][)][2]



_𝑃_ = _[𝑑𝑥]_

_𝑘_









**Figure 1: Bonding curve mechanism. Red solid line describes**
**the relationship between the total SOL deposited by traders**
**and the total meme coins received. From this, the price of the**
**meme coin in terms of SOL can also be derived (blue solid**
**line). Blue and red dotted lines are the initial price and mi-**
**gration price.** _𝑥_ [′] **and** _𝑦_ [′] **are 30 and 1,073,000,191, respectively**


bonding curve mechanism, introduced in the next subsection, sets
the price. This stage is similar to the primary market, where traders
trade with the issuer. Two trivial differences between the meme
coin launch stage and the stock IPO are: (1) traders can withdraw
the subscription at any point at this stage; and (2) the subscription
price and withdrawal price are variable based on the bonding curve
mechanism instead of being fixed.
After 800 meme coins are purchased (subscribed), the meme coin
project automatically enters the next stage, which is called “migration”. Migration means the meme coin project receives sufficient
subscription and will be listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX)
so that traders can trade with other traders (i.e., the secondary
market). At this stage, the trading on DEX is nothing essentially
different from the trading on a stock exchange.
Besides the financial market functions, Pumpfun provides social
platform functions. Any user with a Solana wallet can comment on
any coin, similar to StockTwit. Each trade bumps the coin’s name to
the front page with a brief jiggle. The platform also flags potential
bot activity and displays meme coin holding details.


**3.2** **Bonding Curve Mechanism**


For the launch stage of a meme coin project, traders can subscribe to
the meme coin using SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, paying
a 1% transaction fee and following the bonding curve mechanism.
This mechanism defines the relationship between the total SOL
deposited and the total meme coins received, given by:


_𝑘_
_𝑦_ = _𝑦_ [′]           - _𝑥_ + _𝑥_ [′] _[,]_ (1)

where _𝑥_ is the amount of SOL deposited, and _𝑦_ is the corresponding
number of meme coins received. The parameters _𝑥_ [′] and _𝑦_ [′] represent
the virtual reserves of SOL and meme coins, respectively, and are
constants set by Pump.fun. Here, _𝑘_ = _𝑥_ [′] _𝑦_ [′] is their constant product.
Based on Equation 1, we can derive the relationship between the



where _𝑝_ is the price of the meme coin in terms of SOL. The bonding
curve mechanism ensures prices rise with increased demand. In
Figure 10, we illustrate the relationship between the total SOL paid
and the total meme coins received and the price of meme coins
expressed in SOL. Once all 800 million meme coins are purchased,
it will be listed on a DEX and the locked 200 million meme coins
are migrated, a process known as “migration” or “graduation”.


**3.3** **Meme Coin Trading Actors**


The meme coin ecosystem studied in this paper involves a diverse
set of participants, each playing a distinct role in the lifecycle of a
meme coin. We identify six key types of players:


_3.3.1_ _Pumpfun._ Pumpfun is the most prominent meme coin launchpad at the time this paper is written. It allows anyone with a Solana
wallet to create and trade meme coins in a standard way. Pumpfun’s business model involves charging a 1% fee on each buy or sell
transaction, as well as a 0.015 SOL migration fee deducted from the
liquidity pool.


_3.3.2_ _DEX._ After a meme coin reaches its migration threshold on
Pumpfun, it is migrated to a DEX, Raydium, for secondary market
trading. The DEX relies on Automatic Market Maker (AMM) for
liquidity provision and meme coin pricing.


_3.3.3_ _Meme Coin Creator._ The creator is the user who initiates a
meme coin by uploading metadata and deploying the smart contract
via Pumpfun. Creators can profit from early token purchases at low
prices, and some employ bots to conceal their ownership, inflate
trading volume, or manipulate sentiment. Thus, creators often act
as both originators and strategic manipulators within the system.


_3.3.4_ _Traders._ Traders are market participants who buy and sell
meme coins either during the Pumpfun launch stage or on the DEX
after migration. They can be affected by both transparent and hidden manipulative activity, and their profitability varies depending
on timing and bot presence.


_3.3.5_ _Bot providers._ Bot providers develop and rent or sell automated scripts to actors—typically creators or traders—who wish
to manipulate market dynamics, as shown in Figure 3. These bots
include bundle bots (to hide ownership), volume bots (to simulate
liquidity), and comment bots (to fabricate community sentiment).
Bot providers commoditize manipulation and lower the cost of executing deceptive strategies, contributing to the industrialization of
wash trading in meme coin markets.


**3.4** **Rug Pull and Manipulation Bots**


While a meme coin migration generally indicates it has attracted
sufficient trader attention and achieved higher trading volume and
liquidity, this pattern does not always reflect genuine market confidence. In practice, malicious actors can exploit migration by orchestrating rug pulls or deploying wash trading bots to manufacture an
illusion of interest and liquidity. Understanding these manipulative

practices is essential to avoid being misled by inflated transaction
data, as we explore next.
The speculative nature of meme coins makes them highly susceptible to rug pulls—sudden exit scams where the meme coin creator
and early participants cash out and abandon the project. To make
the scam appear organic, actors often deploy multiple fake wallets
to simulate active trading and widespread interest while concealing
their own positions, as illustrated in Figure 3. This fabricated activity attracts new buyers, enabling early actors to profit. Typically,
three types of automated scripts or bots are used: bundle bots, volume bots, and comment bots. These scripts control multiple wallets
to execute coordinated transactions.


_3.4.1_ _Bundle Bot._ A launch bundle bot is utilized when a creator
launches a meme coin. During a launch on platforms like Pumpfun,
the creator can purchase the meme coin at the lowest price based
on a bonding curve mechanism, thereby driving up the price by subscribing to more tokens. However, these transactions, including the

creator’s holdings, are publicly visible on the Pumpfun dashboard.
If the creator engages in heavy purchasing to inflate the price, it
may signal concentrated ownership to other traders, deterring them
from investing due to fears of a rug pull.
To counteract this visibility, the launch bundle bot enables the
creator to generate, fund, and control multiple wallets, which simultaneously buy the meme coin during the same creation block.
This masks centralized ownership and creates an illusion of organic
demand. This technique is analogous to _concealed ownership_ strategies in stock markets, where traders may split their orders across
multiple accounts or brokers to obscure their intentions. However,
Pumpfun flags transactions occurring within the same block as
potential bot activity, making this approach easily detectable. Moreover, only the coin creator can insert transactions into the creation
block, further exposing such behavior as suspicious. We illustrate
the heuristics of bundle bots in Figure 4.


_3.4.2_ _Bump Bot._ On Pumpfun, each transaction updates a token’s
displayed attributes—such as its name, price, and recent trading
activity—on the platform’s front page, thereby enhancing its visibility and attracting attention from potential traders. Token creators
may exploit this mechanism by deploying bumpbots that repeatedly
execute offsetting buy and sell orders. These artificial transactions
do not alter actual holdings but instead create the illusion of heightened trading interest, inflating the token’s perceived popularity.
We illustrate the heuristic of the bump bot in Figure 5.

_3.4.3_ _Comment Bot._ A Comment Bot is an automated script designed to fabricate user engagement by generating fake comments
that simulate community interest and enthusiasm around a meme
coin. Operating through multiple controlled wallets, the bot disseminates brief, context-free, and easily replicable positive messages.
These comments typically lack substantive information yet are
crafted to convey an impression of widespread support and social validation, using phrases such as “To the moon!”, “Don’t miss
out!”, or “Huge potential here!”. The primary objective is to mislead
genuine users into perceiving strong community backing, thereby
encouraging investment under the false assumption of popular
traction.


**4** **A Meme Coin Case Study**


To investigate how manipulative bots influence the lifecycle of a
[meme coin, we present a case study in Figure 6. We select MAO](https://pump.fun/coin/2F84uaBysP4sD7Qby33fAM9RrSzhcR9KWrUT1ixwpump)
as a presentative example because it exhibits all four types of bots
discussed in subsection 3.4. While not all meme coins feature every
type of bot, this case illustrates their mechanisms and clarifies
how bots shape the lifecycle of a meme coin. For simplicity, wallet
addresses are abbreviated to their first five characters.


**4.1** **Token Creation and Launch Bundle**


At 15:06:24 on January 17, 2025, in block 314596960, token creator
wallet 7xA7A created meme coin MAO, marked as stage 1 on the
timeline in Figure 6. Within the same block, the creator employs
an automated script to generate multiple fresh wallets (e.g., 712nX,
6fYzn, and 4hZpo) and purchase MAO, as shown by the red box in
the left-hand transaction history panel in Figure 6. This behavior
exemplifies the launch bundle described in subsubsection 3.4.1,
whereby newly created wallets fabricate trading activity, artificially
inflate the coin price, and conceal the creator’s true position.


**4.2** **Sniper Bot Front-Running**


Only four blocks and one second after the launch, the sniper wallet
EW6Dk front-ran all other retail traders and purchased the meme
coin (orange box and stage 2). This automated sniper bot secured a
relatively low entry price through its speed advantage while slightly
inflating the coin’s price.


**4.3** **Comment and Bump Bot**


From 15:10:17 to 16:26:42, comment bots disseminated fabricated
positive messages (blue box and stage 3), such as “SENDOOR”, a
term suggesting that the meme coin would accumulate sufficient
market capitalization to migrate. This behavior created the illusion
of active community communication and lured uninformed traders
to participate. Between 15:37:36 and 16:40:45, the bump bot 4h7Lk..
repeatedly bought and sold the same amount of MAO (purple box
and stage 4). Each transaction was bumped to the front page of
Pumpfun, thereby attracting additional users.


**4.4** **Rug Pull**


At 16:40:54, the creator and associated launch bundles began selling
their holdings with a significant profit, causing the meme coin’s
price to drop sharply within a minute (red box and stage 5). The
sniper then detected this movement and exited its position with a



moderate profit (orange box and stage 5). Ultimately, most retail
traders closed their holdings with a loss.
We also visualize the two key performance metrics for meme coin
projects: (1) The vertical dashed gray line indicates the maximum
return, defined as the return between the initial price and the peak
price. (2) The horizontal dashed gray line denotes dump duration,
measured as the time in seconds from the peak time to the point
where the price falls to 10% of its peak price.


**5** **Analyzing Meme Coin Bot Activity**


Figure 7 presents the distribution of two performance metrics, maximum return and dump duration, for meme coin projects with and
without specific bots. Projects with a launch bundle tend to exhibit
slightly higher maximum returns but shorter dump duration on
average. This can be attributed to the launch bundle concealing the
creator’s holdings and fabricating demand, attracting more traders.
However, given the malicious nature of launch bundles, creators
often use them to dump the coin quickly to make profits, shortening
the dump period. Most projects have sniper bots, and performance
differences between those with and without sniper bots are negligible. Projects with comment bots and bump bots display significant
increases in both performance metrics. This is intuitive, as bump
bots push the coin to Pumpfun’s front page for greater trader exposure, while comment bots fabricate the appearance of an active
community to attract traders.


**6** **Methodology**


In this section, we first decompose the meme coin copy trading
process into a series of subtasks and formalize each component. We
then introduce our proposed multi-agent meme coin copy trading
framework, illustrated in Figure 9. This framework allows multiple
agents to learn from few-shot CoT prompting and make explainable
decisions across wallet selection and meme coin selection.


**7** **Problem Formulation**

**7.1** **Meme coin selection**


We first evaluate meme coin project performance using transaction
indicators, candlestick charts, and user comments. Given a vector
of meme coin transaction indicators _𝜶𝑡_ −1 = [ _𝛼𝑖,𝑡_ −1] _𝑚_ ×1, where
_𝑚_ is the total number of transaction indicators, and candlestick
chart _𝑣𝑡_ −1, and a vector of comments c _𝑡_ −1 = [ _𝑐𝑖,𝑡_ −1] _𝑛_ ×1, where _𝑛_
is the total number of comments, our goal is to classify and select
meme coin _𝑖_ with above-average log return, which is defined as
_𝑟𝑡,𝑡_ + _𝑗_ = log( _[𝑝]_ _𝑝_ _[𝑡]_ [+] _𝑡_ _[𝑗]_ [)][, where] _[ 𝑝][𝑡]_ [+] _[𝑗]_ [is the price when migration and] _[ 𝑝][𝑡]_ [+] _[𝑗]_

is the price in _𝑗_ minutes.


**7.2** **Wallet selection**


We then identify trader wallets with consistent profitability and
low-frequency trading behavior (referred to as KOL). Given a vector
of trader-specific transaction indicators _𝜷𝑡_ −1 = [ _𝛽𝑖,𝑡_ −1] _𝑚_ ×1, where
_𝑚_ is the total number of trader-specific transaction indicators, we
need to classify and select traders with the positive profit Π _𝑗_ on a
specific meme coin _𝑗_ .

In this paper, we propose an explainable multi-agent framework for
meme coin copy trading, as illustrated in Figure 9. The framework
consists of four agents: the trader evaluation agent, wealth agent,
meme evaluation agent, and DEX agent. The trader evaluation agent

selects wallets with consistent profitability and low-frequency trading behavior. The wealth agent manages fund allocation to follow
the selected KOL wallets. The meme evaluation agent identifies
high-potential, long-lived meme coins using multi-modal data such
as transaction metrics, candlestick charts, and user comments. The
DEX agent is responsible for the execution of the trading. Each
agent is trained with meme coin trading knowledge and domainspecific reasoning via few-shot CoT prompting.

The algorithm extracts the launch block and transaction history of
a meme coin from on-chain data, aggregates transactions occurring
in the same block into bundles, and classifies each bundle according
to the following rules: (1) bundles in the launch block involving
transfers between the creator and transaction makers are identified
as creator-funded bundles; (2) bundles outside the launch block
containing only buy orders are labeled as buy bundles; (3) bundles
outside the launch block with only buy orders and creator-to-trader
transfers are classified as creator-funded buy bundles; and (4) bundles outside the launch block containing only sell orders are defined
as sell bundles.
However, the algorithm does not capture all possible cases of
creator-funded launch or buy bundles, as the creator may channel funds indirectly through intermediary wallets or centralized
exchange (CEX). The agent then examines the meme coin’s candlestick chart to identify potential bundle bot activities. Projects with
weak farming prospects often exhibit charts with a few large green
candles, suggesting that early participants opened sizable positions
to dump after migration (see Figure 10b). In contrast, promising
projects typically show a healthy pre-migration phase with multiple price fluctuations, reflecting active and organic trading (see
Figure 10a).
To detect the presence of a bump bot, we propose the algorithm described in Algorithm 2, building on the heuristic illustrated
in Figure 5. We define a wash trading score for each meme coin
trader, calculated as the ratio of the number of matched buy–sell
transaction pairs of identical amounts to the trader’s net position.
This metric captures the characteristic behavior of wash trading
bots, which repeatedly execute offsetting trades without materially
changing their overall holdings. A meme coin is classified as having
a wash trading bot if at least one trader exhibits a wash trading
score exceeding the predefined threshold _𝑐_ (set to 50 in this study).
Next, the agent assesses the sentiment of comments. Strong farming potential is often relevant to the participants of non-bot positive
comments. Finally, the agent outputs a binary judgment, yes or no,
on whether the project offers good farming potential. System instructions, prompts, and few-shot CoT examples are provided in
the appendix.



**Figure 10: Pre-migration candlestick chart.**


learns expert knowledge to identify meme coins with strong farming potential—those likely to exhibit sustained upside in the future.
We structure the agent’s reasoning along three key dimensions.
First, the agent evaluates transaction-level metrics to assess farming potential. Strong opportunities are typically characterized by
the absence of creator-funded bundles, moderately sized buy and
sell bundles, the existence of the bump bot, and high trading activity, as reflected in longer pre-migration durations, a greater number
of unique traders, and higher transaction volumes.
Building on the bundle bot heuristics in Figure 4, we propose
an algorithm to detect their presence, as illustrated in Algorithm 1.

**(b) ROC Curves.**



**Figure 11: Model performance on the test set measured by**
**Precision,** _𝐹_ 1 **, and ROC AUC at different threshold levels.**


**8.2** **Wallet evaluation agent**


To address the wallet selection problem, we introduce a wallet evaluation agent. Employing few-shot CoT prompting, the agent learns
to identify KOL wallets—those with infrequent but consistently
profitable trades. Its reasoning is based on three trader metrics:
profitability ( _Total Profit_, _Total Profit Std_ ), trading frequency ( _Total_
_Average Transaction Number_, _Total Average Transaction Std_ ), and
trading experience ( _Total Average Transaction Number_ ). The agent
outputs a binary decision indicating whether a wallet qualifies
as a KOL. Details of system instructions, prompts, and few-shot
CoT examples for the wallet evaluation agent are included in the
appendix.


**8.3** **Wealth and DEX agent**


The wealth agent is responsible for managing cash allocation in
the copy-trading process. Based on the current wallet balance, it
determines whether executing a copy trade is feasible and optimal.
The DEX agent handles trade execution, interfacing directly with
the DEX smart contract to perform transactions efficiently and
reliably.


**9** **Experiment**


In this section, we discuss the experiment settings and evaluate
the performance of our multi-agent system for meme coin copy
trading.


**9.1** **Experiment Settings**


We utilize transaction and transfer data sourced from Flipside,
which maintains archive nodes with fully indexed access to Solana’s
historical data. In particular, we gather the contract address, launch
time and block, migration time and block, and the creator’s wallet
address for the first 1,000 meme coins that migrated from Pump.fun
to a DEX following the launch of $TRUMP on 2025-01-17 at 14:01:48.
For each of these coins, we extract their transaction and transfer
records from their initial launch up to 12 hours after migration.
Transaction data includes the block number, timestamp, trader address, transaction type (buy/sell), meme token amount, SOL amount,
and USD equivalent. Transfer data includes the block number, timestamp, sender, receiver, and the amount of tokens transferred.



**9.2** **Performance of Meme Evaluation Agent**


First, we assess the performance of the meme evaluation agent.
Since some data sources may be noisy or less informative, we also
report the performance of agents using each data modality individually. Figure 5 shows the results of the meme evaluation agent with
CoT prompting across different data types. The agent using transaction data achieves high precision and fair accuracy but low recall
and F1 score, indicating a conservative approach that may overlook profitable farming opportunities. Precision rises from 1 to 30
minutes and then declines from 30 minutes to 10 hours, suggesting
the strongest predictive power around the 30-minute mark. Agents
relying on technical or comment data show similar patterns: high
precision and fair accuracy but low recall and F1 score, again reflecting an overly conservative stance. In contrast, the agent combining
all data sources achieves strong accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score, effectively filtering out poor opportunities while capturing a
wide range of promising ones. Its performance also remains stable
across various post-migration intervals.


**9.3** **Performance of Wallet Evaluation Agent**


Next, we evaluate the performance of the wallet evaluation agent.
Table 3 presents its classification confusion matrix. Given the large
number of traders involved in a single migrated meme coin, we
place greater emphasis on precision over recall. The agent achieves
a precision of approximately 70% (4773/6879) in identifying wallets worth copy trading, which is quite strong. This suggests that
the wallet evaluation agent can effectively predict future wallet
profitability based on historical trading features.


**10** **Conclusion**


In this paper, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent
framework for meme coin copy trading that employs few-shot
chain-of-thought prompting and algorithmic bot detection. By
decomposing the complex trading process into four specialized
agents—meme evaluation, trader evaluation, wealth management,
and order execution—our system mimics the decision-making workflow of professional asset managers. Empirical evaluation on 1,000
meme coin projects demonstrates that our framework effectively
identifies high-quality meme coins and consistently profitable KOL
wallets, achieving 70–73% precision. The selected KOL wallets collectively generated over $500,000 in profit, validating the practical
utility of our approach. Our work highlights the promise of LLMpowered multi-agent systems in navigating volatile, informationrich environments such as meme coin markets.

single green candle from launch to migration, suggesting
that early participants may have opened large positions
with the intention of dumping after migration. Regardless
of the transaction indicators or comment history, this
pattern indicates a high likelihood of a post-migration
sell-off. Therefore, the meme coin does not exhibit good
farming potential.", "good_farming": false}

Does this meme coin have good farming potential?"


A: {"reasoning": "First, the candlestick chart shows a
healthy pre-migration duration with multiple price
fluctuations, indicating active trading activity. Second,
the meme coin lacks both a creator-funded bundle and a
creator-funded buy bundle, suggesting that the creator
is not manipulating the market. Third, the buy and sell
bundles are both at a moderate level, pointing to medium
bot activity. Fourth, the high pre-migration duration, high
number of unique traders, and high transaction volume all
indicate robust community engagement and activity. Fifth,
the low holding centralization suggests a decentralized
token distribution. Finally, the comment history is predominantly positive, reflecting strong community sentiment.
Taken together, these factors indicate that the meme coin
exhibits good farming potential.", "good_farming": true}

Does this meme coin have good farming potential?"


A: {"reasoning": "First, the candlestick chart shows a
medium pre-migration duration, indicating some level of
community engagement. Second, this meme coin involves
a creator-funded bundle, indicating the creator accumulated a significant share of tokens before migration. Such
behavior often signals an intent to dump post-migration,
which undermines the coin’s sustainability. Despite favorable candlestick chart, transaction indicators, and comment
history, the presence of a creator-funded bundle strongly
suggests poor farming potential.", "good_farming": false}
