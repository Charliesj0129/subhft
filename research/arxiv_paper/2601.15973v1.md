I. INTRODUCTION

Laser-based intensity modulation and direct detection
(IM/DD) optical wireless communication (OWC) systems
find widespread use owing to their superior performance and
low complexity. In these systems, at the transmitter, a laser’s
output intensity is modulated by an electrical signal, and at the
receiver, the photocurrent from the received optical signal is
directly converted to an electrical signal via a transimpedance
amplifier (TIA). Hence, unlike coherent systems [1], no output
phase control and local oscillators are needed at the transmitter
and receiver, respectively, which lowers the system complexity
significantly.
However, since quadrature modulation cannot be utilized
in IM/DD systems, their spectral efficiency is half that of
coherent optical systems [2], [3]. Furthermore, their sensitivity
is low due to the lack of local oscillators. Nevertheless,
with careful beam management and by exploiting the large,
unlicensed bandwidth at optical frequencies, IM/DD links can
exceed data rates of 1 Tbps [4], [5].
The capacity and achievable rates of IM/DD systems have
been studied in detail [2], [3], [6]. Furthermore, technologies
such as light fidelity (LiFi) [7] based on IM/DD systems have
been proposed. More recently, in order to enhance performance,
robustness to misalignment, and design and deployment
flexibility, photodetector (PD) array-based receivers have been
proposed [8]–[13].
In PD array-based receivers, instead of a single PD, an array
of PDs is utilized. Furthermore, the electrical signals generated
by the incident beam are optimally combined in the electrical
domain. Moreover, since the active areas of the PDs are smaller
compared to a single reference PD, their bandwidth can be
enhanced via careful design [14]. However, in square-law
detection systems, such as IM/DD systems, the received



electrical power is proportional to the square of the received
optical power [14], [15]. Taking this into account is important
for systems that combine signals in the electrical domain, see

[16], [17]. However, a systematic study of the impact of the
square-law relationship is not available in the literature.
Therefore, in this letter, we study the performance scaling
laws for electrical-domain combining in PD arrays, taking
into account the above square-law relationship. In particular,
we compare their performance to a single reference PD for
Gaussian, Laguerre-Gaussian (LG), and uniform laser beam
patterns, which realize different levels of beam concentration
on the PD array. We consider two different design choices:
(1) The combined active area of the PD array scales with the
number of PDs, (2) the combined active area remains constant,
i.e., the active areas of the individual PDs shrink. We provide
intuition to guide the design of next-generation PD array-based
systems. The contributions of this letter are as follows.

We develop a model for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

_•_
and achievable rates for PD array-based receivers, taking
into account the square-law relationship between the
optical and electrical powers as well as the impact of the
PD size on bandwidth.

We introduce a _loss factor_ and use it to model the extent

_•_
of suboptimality for different beam patterns, and to
compare the performance of PD array-based receivers
for the two considered design choices with that of a
reference receiver employing a single PD.
Through analysis and numerical simulations, we show that PD
arrays provide a performance gain when the incident beam
is sufficiently narrow and when the received SNR is above
a threshold, which depends on the incident beam pattern.
Furthermore, we show that, in most cases, the performance
of the reference receiver can be exceeded by increasing the
received power and not by increasing the number of PDs
alone. Lastly, we show that, for PD array-based receivers,
direct detection of higher-order transverse electromagnetic
laser beam modes is suboptimal, and a mode conversion to
the fundamental Gaussian beam is beneficial.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we introduce the receiver model and review the factors affecting the bandwidth of PDs. Furthermore, we describe
the considered beam patterns. In Section III, we derive the
performance scaling laws. Numerical results and discussions are
provided in Section IV, and the paper is concluded in Section V.


II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we provide the receiver model, discuss
briefly the factors affecting PD bandwidth, and describe the


2



considered laser beam patterns.


_A. Receiver Model_
We consider a point-to-point IM/DD OWC system
comprising a transmitter and a receiver, and focus on the
receiver design. The receiver is composed of a PD array with _M_
identical PDs and employs linear signal processing to combine
the received signals from the PDs, after the TIA, in the electrical
domain. Let the _optical_ power received by the _m_ -th PD be
denoted by _Pm_ [Rx] _[,]_ [O] _, m_ =1 _,...,M,_ and let _P_ tot [Rx] _[,]_ [O] = [�] _[M]_ _m_ =1 _[P]_ [ Rx] _m_ _[,]_ [O]
denote the total received power. The received _electrical_ power
for the _m_ -th PD is given by _Pm_ [Rx] _[,]_ [E] = ( _R_ PD _Pm_ [Rx] _[,]_ [O] ) [2] as an
inherent consequence of square-law detection [15], [18], where
_R_ PD denotes the responsivity of the PDs in A/W, which
is assumed to be identical for all PDs. Furthermore, let _B_
and _N_ 0 denote the bandwidth and the thermal noise power
spectral density of a PD, respectively, which are also assumed
to be identical for all PDs [1] . Moreover, we consider OWC in
the thermal noise limited regime where the impact of shot
noise and relative intensity noise is considered negligible [12].
Hence, the SNR for the _m_ -th PD, _m_ =1 _,...,M,_ is given by

_γm_ = [(] _[R]_ [PD] _[P]_ _m_ [ Rx] _[,]_ [O] ) [2] _._ (1)

Next, we describe the area-bandwidth trade-off of PDs.

_B. Area-Bandwidth Trade-Off_
The 3-dB bandwidth of a PD is given by
_B_ = ~~_√_~~ (2 _πR_ L _C_ j1) [2] +(2 _πt_ τ) [2] [[14], where] _[ C]_ [j][ =] _ϵAd_ denotes

the junction capacitance and _ϵ, A,_ and _d_ denote the junction
permittivity, area, and thickness, respectively, _R_ L denotes the
load resistance, and _t_ τ denotes the junction carrier transit time.
As has been shown in [14], when the bandwidth is limited
by the junction capacitance, _B ∝_ _A_ [1] [holds, while when it is]

beams with _G_ = 3 rings and _ρ_ = 0 _._ 5 on a PD array employing the optimal
hexagonal packing. PDs marked with a _⋆_ denote the six corner PDs in each ring.


For the degenerate beam pattern, we have _P_ 1 [Rx] _[,]_ [O] = _P_ tot [Rx] _[,]_ [O]
and _Pm_ [Rx] _[,]_ [O] =0 _, m_ =2 _,...,M,_ up to permutation. That is, the
PD with index 1 receives all the power and the other PDs do
not receive any optical signal.
Next, for the uniform optical received power distribution,

tot
we have _Pm_ [Rx] _[,]_ [O] = _[P]_ [ Rx] _M_ _[,]_ [O] _,_ for _m_ =1 _,...,M._ That is, all the PDs

receive the same optical power.
Next, we consider the Gaussian [2] and LG10 beam patterns.
We note that the Gaussian beam concentrates energy close to
the center, whereas the LG10 beam has the energy concentrated
in a ring around a central vortex, as shown in Figure 1.
Furthermore, for these beams, since the captured energy
depends on the placement of the PDs in the PD array, we
assume the optimal hexagonal packing [3], which covers about
90% of the circular area [19]. Furthermore, we assume that
_M_ has the form _M_ = 1+3 _G_ ( _G_ +1) _,_ for some non-negative
integer _G._ This enables positioning a central PD aligned to
the incident beam center, and _G_ concentric hexagonal rings
in the periphery, where the _g_ -th ring contains 6 _g_ PDs. The
pattern is illustrated in Figure 1 for the Gaussian and LG10
modes for _G_ =3 and _ρ_ =0 _._ 5 _._ Throughout this letter, _ρ_ denotes
the ratio of the PD radius to the beam waist.
Next, based on [19], [20], for the Gaussian beam, the
received optical power for the central PD is given by


(1 e _[−]_ [2] _[ρ]_ [2] )
_P_ 1 [Rx] _[,]_ [O] = _−_ _[P]_ tot [ Rx] _[,]_ [O] _,_ (2)
1 _−_ e _[−]_ [2(] _[G]_ [+1)][2] _[ρ]_ [2]

where the expressions in the numerator and denominator are
obtained by Gaussian radial integration and are the received
optical powers for the central and reference PDs, respectively,
and their ratio denotes the fraction of the total power received
by the central PD. Furthermore, the received optical power for
the six corner PDs on ring _g, g_ =1 _,...,G,_ which are marked
with a _⋆_ in Figure 1, is given by


_P_ Gauss [Rx] _[,]_ [O] _,_ c _,g_ [= ][(1] _[−][Q]_ [1][(4] _[gρ,]_ [2] _[ρ]_ [))] _[P]_ [ Rx] tot _[,]_ [O] _,_ (3)

1 _−_ e _[−]_ [2(] _[G]_ [+1)][2] _[ρ]_ [2]


2We note that the fundamental LG00 mode is equivalent to the Gaussian
beam.
3We note that, although in this letter we limit ourselves to representative
LG modes and the optimal hexagonal packing, the methods described can
be extended to arbitrary modes and positions of PDs within the PD array in
a straightforward manner.



by the junction capacitance, _B ∝_ _A_ [1] [holds, while when it is]

limited by the carrier transit time, _B_ is independent of _A,_ and
when the junction thickness is optimized for the maximum
bandwidth, then _B ∝_ ~~_√_~~ 1 _A_ _[,]_ [ see also [12]. We consider all three]



bandwidth, then _B ∝_ ~~_√_~~ 1 _A_ _[,]_ [ see also [12]. We consider all three]

regimes. Furthermore, in order to identify the most beneficial
operating regime of the PD array, we compare its performance
with that of a single reference PD of fixed bandwidth _B_ 0
and the same total active area. This ensures that the effect of
bandwidth expansion due to the changed active area of the
PDs when scaling the PD array is properly taken into account.
Moreover, we assume that, in all three cases above, the initial
bandwidth of the PD array, i.e., for _M_ =1 _,_ is _B_ 0 _._
Next, we define optical power distribution patterns, which
will be considered throughout the letter.



_C. Considered Laser Beam Patterns_

In the following, we consider four laser beam patterns. The
degenerate and uniform beam patterns serve as edge cases for
the laser beam power distribution. On the other hand, Gaussian
and LG10 beam patterns, which we consider as representative
patterns for our study, are the more practical schemes.


1As noted later, the developed results and intuitions are also valid for
unequal responsivities and noise power spectral densities.

_B. Loss Factor_

In order to derive insights for the practical case, where
the received optical power distribution is not degenerate, we
define the actually achieved (suboptimal) SNR as

_γ_ sub = [(] _[βR]_ [PD] _[P]_ tot [ Rx] _[,]_ [O] ) [2] = _β_ [2] _γ_ mrc _[⋆]_ _[,]_ (9)

_BN_ 0

where _β,_ 0 _≤_ _β ≤_ 1 _,_ is the _loss factor,_ which models the
suboptimality of the PD design and incident beam with a
single parameter. In the following, we utilize the above model
based on _γ_ sub for analyzing arbitrary beam power distributions,
including Gaussian, LG10 _,_ and uniform beams, incident on
the hexagonal PD arrangement described earlier.


_C. Performance Comparison with the Reference PD_

From Section II-B, we note that the bandwidth _B_ of the PDs
scales as _B_ = _M_ _[ξ]_ _B_ 0 _,_ where _ξ_ = 1 _,_ [1] 2 _[,]_ [ and][ 0][ for capacitance]

limited, thickness optimized, and transit-time limited PDs,
where the active area of the individual PDs is assumed to be
1
_M_ [-th of the reference][ PD][. Hence, the achievable rate,] _[ R,]_ [ for]
the PD array is given by the Shannon formula [5] as



Here, _Qm_ ( _a,b_ ) denotes the Marcum’s _Q_ function of order
_m._ Analogously, based on [21], [22], for the LG10 beam, the
received optical power for the central PD is given by

_P_ 1 [Rx] _[,]_ [O] = (1 _−_ e _[−]_ [2] _[ρ]_ [2] _−_ 2 _ρ_ [2] e _[−]_ [2] _[ρ]_ [2] ) _P_ tot [Rx] _[,]_ [O] _[.]_ (5)

Furthermore, the received optical power for the six corner
PDs on ring _g, g_ =1 _,...,G,_ is given by



_P_ 1 [Rx] _[,]_ [O] = (1 _−_ e _[−]_ [2] _[ρ]_ [2] _−_ 2 _ρ_ [2] e _[−]_ [2] _[ρ]_ [2] ) _P_ tot [Rx] _[,]_ [O] _[.]_ (5)
1 _−_ e _[−]_ [2(] _[G]_ [+1)][2] _[ρ]_ [2] _−_ 2( _G_ +1) [2] _ρ_ [2] e _[−]_ [2(] _[G]_ [+1)][2] _[ρ]_ [2]

and, for the remaining (6 _g−_ 6) PDs, it is given by



_ϕ_ ( _√_

Next, we derive the performance scaling laws.

III. COMBINING IN THE ELECTRICAL DOMAIN

In this section, we analyze the impact of combining in the
electrical domain and derive the performance scaling laws for
IM/DD systems employing PD arrays.


_A. Optimal SNR_
First, we note that for maximal ratio combining, which is
the optimal linear combining scheme, the SNR, _γ_ mrc _,_ is given
by _γ_ mrc = [�] _[M]_ _m_ =1 _[γ][m][,]_ [ whose maximum value depends on the]
input optical power distribution, which can be optimized as



_R_ = _M_ _[ξ]_ _B_ 0log�1+ _β_ [2] _[γ]_ _M_ mrc _[⋆]_ _[ξ]_



For a PD array with _M >_ 1 PDs to have a better performance
than the single reference PD,

_R_ _≥_ _B_ 0log(1+ _γ_ mrc _[⋆]_ [)] (11)

must be satisfied, which leads to the condition



_β_ [2] _β_ min [2] [=] _[M][ ξ]_
_≥_ _γ_ mrc _[⋆]_



�(1+ _γ_ mrc _[⋆]_ [)]



_M_ 1 _[ξ]_ _−_ 1� _._ (12)



_Pm_ [Rx] _[,]_ [O] _[⋆]_ _,_ _m_ = arg max
_{_ _∀_ _}_
_{Pm_ [Rx] _[,]_ [O] _,∀m}_

    - _Mm_ =1 _[P]_ _m_ [ Rx] _[,]_ [O] _≤_ _P_ tot [Rx] _[,]_ [O]



_γ_ mrc _._
(8)



Hence, for _β_ [2] _≥_ _β_ min [2] _[,]_ [ which is discussed in detail below, a][ PD]
array meets or exceeds the performance of the single reference
PD. Therefore, ideally, _β_ min [2] [must be as low as possible to]
establish a low barrier. On the other hand, when _β_ [2] _<β_ min [2] _[,]_ [ PD]
arrays offer no performance benefit over the single reference
PD, but may have other advantages such as misalignment
tolerance and fabrication ease, see, e.g., [9], [11], among others.
_1) Impact of Scaling γ_ mrc _[⋆]_ _[:]_ [ We note that][ lim] _[γ]_ mrc _[⋆]_ _[→∞][β]_ min [2] [=0]
for all _ξ._ Hence, _β_ min [2] [can be made arbitrarily small by]
increasing the received SNR, _γ_ mrc _[⋆]_ _[,]_ [ sufficiently. This enables]
us to meet or exceed the reference PD performance for
arbitrary _β_ [2] _,_ see Section III-D3.
_2) Impact of Scaling M_ _:_ Next, we note that for _ξ_ = 1 _,_ [1] 2 _[,]_

lim _M_ _→∞_ _β_ min [2] [=] [log(1+] _γ_ mrc _[⋆]_ _[γ]_ mrc _[⋆]_ [)] _,_ indicating that for both capacitance and thickness optimized devices, _β_ min [2] [has an asymptotic]
floor. Hence, unlike with SNR, _β_ min [2] [cannot be made arbitrarily]
small. Therefore, scaling _M_ alone is not sufficient to meet
the reference PD performance. On the other hand, for _ξ_ =0 _,_
lim _M_ _→∞β_ min [2] [=1] _[,]_ [ indicating that only the degenerate received]
optical power distribution meets the reference PD performance.


5We note that although we utilize the Shannon formula to analyze the
impact of bandwidth on performance, the insights obtained in this paper are
also applicable to the upper and lower bounds in [2], [3].



Based on [23, Theorem C.1 and Equation (8)], Problem
(8) is Schur-convex, and the optimal received optical power
distribution is degenerate [4], up to permutation, see Section II-C.
Hence, for optimal performance, the received beam must be
incident on a single PD in the PD array in order to minimize the
loss due to the square-law relationship between the optical and
electrical powers. In such a case, the optimal SNR is given by
tot ) [2]

vortex beams, uniform beams, and other higher-order transverse _γ_ mrc _[⋆]_ [=] [(] _[R]_ [PD] _BN_ _[P]_ [ Rx] 0 _[,]_ [O] _._ Hence, beam patterns such as Gaussian,
electromagnetic beams do not achieve the maximum SNR in
general. Nevertheless, focusing all power on a single PD of
the PD array is impractical due to alignment considerations
and the law of ´etendue conservation, which disallows arbitrary
concentration of beams. Next, in the following, we model the
extent of _suboptimality_ of the considered practical beams.


4We note that, based on [23, Theorem C.1 and Equation (8)], the degenerate
distribution is optimal also when the responsivity and noise variance of the
PDs are not identical.

to the vortex of the latter and the greater spreading of the

to other higher order modes, which spread their incident
power over larger areas compared to the Gaussian beam.

_β_ [2] _,_ the performance of the reference PD can be met by




          increasing the received _optical_ power by _α_ =



increasing the received _optical_ power by _α_ = - _ββ_ min [2][2] _[.]_ [ We]

i.e., for suboptimal systems with _β_ [2] _< β_ min [2] _[,]_ [ the received]
power must continually increase with increasing _G_ in order
to meet the reference PD performance.



IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we present numerical results, along with
a discussion.
First, we study the minimum loss factor _β_ min [2] _[,]_ [ which]
incorporates the effects of bandwidth expansion and SNR via

PDs are slightly inferior compared to capacitance limited ones.
Nevertheless, they perform similarly asymptotically. Moreover,
as the SNR increases, the required _β_ min [2] [decreases significantly.]
This validates the analytical observation that PD arrays become
beneficial above a certain SNR threshold, where the bandwidth
gain achieved by reducing the PD area outweighs the electrical
power loss caused by the square-law relationship, see Section
III. On the other hand, for _ξ_ =0 _, β_ min [2] [is independent of] _[ M.]_
Next, in the following figures, we study the the loss factor _β_ [2] _,_
which models the effects of beam shape and parameters, array
PD positions, and the impact of square-law. Figure 3 shows _β_ [2]

versus _M_ for Gaussian and LG10 beams [7] when the PD-radiusto-beam-waist ratio _ρ_ is kept constant, along with the asymptotic values discussed in Section III. In this case, with increasing
_M,_ the overall active area of the PD array increases. The results
show that for small _ρ_, both modes exhibit a rapid decay of _β_ [2] _,_
with LG10 degrading substantially faster than Gaussian owing
to its vortex and greater power spread. Comparatively, the
uniform beam experiences an intermediate performance degradation. For larger _ρ_, where most of the optical power is concentrated on the central PD, _β_ [2] approaches unity, which is consistent with the degenerate distribution. These results highlight the
strong dependence of performance on beam concentration and

modes. Lastly, in this and the next figures, pink shading denotes
the region in which _β_ [2] _≥_ _β_ min [2] [for] _[ ξ]_ [ =1][ and] _[ γ]_ mrc _[⋆]_ [=20][ dB.]
Next, Figure 4 considers a more practical scenario, where
_ρ_ decreases with increasing array size as _ρ_ = _ρ_ 0 _/_ ( _G_ +1) _._ This
corresponds to the case where the PD radius shrinks with
_M,_ while the reference PD size remains constant. Here, the
effective beam footprint becomes increasingly spread over
the PD array as _M_ grows. Hence, _β_ [2] degrades for increasing
_M_ for both modes, and the gap between Gaussian and LG10
widens. This result shows that, for realistic receiver scaling,
increasing the number of PDs exacerbates the square-law
penalty unless the received beam remains sufficiently narrow.
Nevertheless, in both cases, the performance of the reference
PD is exceeded whenever _β_ [2] _>β_ min [2] [for the designed system]
parameters. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the analysis in Section III. Gaussian beams behave like uniform beams
for small _ρ_ and like degenerate beams for large _ρ_, whereas
higher-order LG modes have a substantially larger penalty due
to their spatially distributed intensity profiles. Therefore, for
PD array-based IM/DD receivers, meeting or exceeding the
performance of a single reference PD generally requires careful
parameter choice or increasing the received power rather than
merely scaling the number of PDs. Furthermore, based on the
large performance penalty, we note that converting higher-order
spatial modes to the fundamental Gaussian mode prior to direct
detection is advantageous in practice. The above results highlight the need for joint optimization of beam pattern, transverse
electromagnetic mode, received power, and PD positions.


V. CONCLUSION

We studied performance scaling laws for PD array-based receivers in IM/DD optical wireless systems by explicitly accounting for the inherent square-law relationship between optical and
electrical powers. By comparing PD arrays to a reference singlePD receiver for Gaussian, LG10 _,_ and uniform beam patterns and
for different PD area scaling assumptions, we showed that PD
arrays provide performance gains for sufficiently narrow beams
and above an SNR threshold, depending on the loss factor _β_ [2] _._
Furthermore, increasing _M_ alone does not exceed reference
PD performance, and, in most cases, received optical power

must be scaled by - _ββ_ min [2][2] to meet it. Moreover, direct detection

of higher-order modes, which spread power over several PDs,
is generally suboptimal, and conversion to the fundamental
Gaussian beam before detection is beneficial. These results provide clear guidelines and highlight the trade-offs in designing
next-generation high-bandwidth PD array receivers.
