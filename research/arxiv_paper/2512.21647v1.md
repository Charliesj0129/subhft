#### Yanyan Song [†], Yaping Mao [‡]

**Abstract**


For edge-ordered graphs _G_ _[≺]_ and _H_ _[≺]_, the size edge-ordered Ramsey number ˆ _r_ edge( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ )

is defined as the smallest integer _m_ for which there exists an edge-ordered graph _F_ _[≺]_ (with

underlying graph _F_ ) having _m_ edges, such that every 2-coloring of the edges of _F_ _[≺]_ contains

a monochromatic edge-ordered subgraph isomorphic to _G_ _[≺]_ or a monochromatic edge-ordered

subgraph isomorphic to _H_ _[≺]_ . Fox and Li posed a foundational question: which families of


edge-ordered graphs have linear or near-linear size edge-ordered Ramsey numbers? In this


paper, we apply Szemer´edi’s regularity lemma to prove that, even for sparse graph families,


specifically the well-defined class of edge-ordered book graphs, the size edge-ordered Ramsey


numbers of this family exhibit non-linear growth. Furthermore, we show that three families


of edge-ordered graphs exhibit linear or near-linear size edge-ordered Ramsey numbers.

### **1 Introduction**


Throughout this paper, all graphs are presumed to be undirected, finite, and simple, any


undefined terms or notations conform to the established conventions in [10]. Let _G_ = ( _V_ ( _G_ ) _, E_ ( _G_ ))


denote a graph comprising vertex set _V_ ( _G_ ) and edge set _E_ ( _G_ ). We employ _Kn_, _Pn_, and _Cn_ to


denote the complete graph, path, and cycle (in that order) on _n_ vertices, with _nK_ 2 representing


an _n_ -edge matching. The _book graph Bm,n_ is defined as the graph formed by taking _n_ copies of

_Km_ +1 and identifying them along a common complete subgraph _Km_ . We refer to this _Km_ as the


_spine_, while the vertices belonging to the independent set are termed the _pages_ .


Ramsey theory explores the unavoidable emergence of organized substructures within large


colored structures, where Ramsey numbers act as a core tool for capturing this inherent property


[21]. The fundamental Ramsey number identifies the minimal graph size ensuring the existence of


a monochromatic subgraph.


**Definition 1.1.** _The Ramsey number r_ ( _G, H_ ) _is the smallest N such that any_ 2 _-coloring of the_


_edges of a complete graph on N vertices, there exists a red copy of G or a blue copy of H._


Classical Ramsey numbers focus on unordered graphs, but recent work has extended this frame

work to edge-ordered graphs where edges carry a total order-introducing new questions about how


edge order impacts Ramsey-type phenomena.

An _edge-ordered graph G_ _[≺]_ is a pair ( _G, ≺_ ) consisting of a graph _G_ = ( _V_ ( _G_ ) _, E_ ( _G_ )) and a linear

ordering _≺_ defined on the edge set _E_ ( _G_ ). An edge-ordered graph _G_ _[≺]_ as an _edge-ordered subgraph_

of an edge-ordered graph _H_ _[≺]_ if _G_ is a subgraph of _H_ and the edge-ordering of _G_ constitutes a

suborder of _H_ ’s edge-ordering. Two edge-ordered graphs _G_ _[≺]_ [1] and _H_ _[≺]_ [2] are _isomorphic_ if there


exists a graph isomorphism _φ_ : _G →_ _H_ whose induced edge-map _φE_ : _E_ ( _G_ ) _→_ _E_ ( _H_ ) satisfies

_e_ 1 _≺_ 1 _e_ 2 if and only if _φE_ ( _e_ 1) _≺_ 2 _φE_ ( _e_ 2) for all _e_ 1 _, e_ 2 _∈_ _E_ ( _G_ ). For a vertex _v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ), _dG≺_ ( _v_ )

stands for the degree of _v_ in _G_, and _δ_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) and ∆( _G_ _[≺]_ ) denote the minimum degree and maximum

degree of _G_ _[≺]_, respectively. The graph _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _H_ _[≺]_ is obtained by eliminating all vertices of _H_ _[≺]_ from

_G_ _[≺]_ . If _H_ _[≺]_ = _{v}_, we simply write _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ . For any two edge-ordered graphs _G_ _[≺]_ and _H_ _[≺]_, their

union _G_ _[≺]_ _∪_ _H_ _[≺]_ possesses vertex set _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _∪_ _V_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ) and edge set _E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _∪_ _E_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ).


Balko and Vizer [6] extended Ramsey numbers to this setting, defining edge-ordered Ramsey


numbers to capture forced monochromatic edge-ordered subgraphs.


**Definition 1.2.** _The_ edge-ordered Ramsey number _redge_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) _, is defined as the smallest in-_

_teger N such that there exists an edge-ordered complete graph KN_ _[≺]_ _[of][ K][N][ such that any]_ [ 2] _[-coloring]_

_of the edges of KN_ _[≺]_ _[contains a red edge-ordered copy of][ G][≺]_ _[or a blue edge-ordered copy of][ H]_ _[≺][.]_


A trivial but critical observation is as follows:


_r_ ( _G, H_ ) _≤_ _r_ edge( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) (1)


for any edge-ordered graphs _G_ _[≺]_ and _H_ _[≺]_, since the edge-ordered Ramsey number must account for

both the underlying graph structure and its edge order. For edge-ordered complete graphs _Km_ _[≺][, K]_ _n_ _[≺]_
with lexicographic edge order, this inequality becomes an equality: _r_ edge( _Km_ _[≺][, K]_ _n_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ r]_ [(] _[K][m][, K][n]_ [).]

This is because the lexicographic order of _Kr_ _[≺]_ ( _Km,Kn_ ) [forces a monochromatic edge-ordered complete]

subgraph whenever it forces a monochromatic _Km_ _[≺]_ [or a monochromatic] _[ K]_ _n_ _[≺]_ [.]

To the best of our knowledge, Ramsey numbers associated with edge-ordered graphs had not


been explored in the academic literature prior to [5]. In contrast, Ramsey numbers for graphs


equipped with ordered vertex sets have undergone substantial investigation in recent years (see


[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 27]).


However, the general existence of edge-ordered Ramsey numbers is not immediately evident.

Balko and Vizer [6] proved that such numbers do indeed exist; they also showed that _r_ edge( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _≤_

2 _[O]_ [(] _[n]_ [3][ log] _[ n]_ [)] holds for any bipartite edge-ordered graph _G_ _[≺]_ on _n_ vertices. Furthermore, they defined


a natural class of edge orderings, termed lexicographic edge-orderings, for which we can establish


significantly sharper upper bounds on the corresponding edge-ordered Ramsey numbers.

The _edge-ordered Ramsey number r_ edge( _G_ _[≺]_ ; _q_ ) is defined as the smallest integer _N_ such that

there exists an edge-ordered complete graph _KN_ _[≺]_ [where any] _[ q]_ [-coloring of the edges of] _[ K]_ _N_ _[≺]_ [contains]

a monochromatic edge-ordered copy of _G_ _[≺]_ . Fox and Li [20] proved that there exists a constant _c_

such that _r_ edge( _H_ _[≺]_ ; _q_ ) _≤_ 2 _[cq][n][n]_ [2] _[q][−]_ [2][ log] _[q][ n]_ for any edge-ordered graph _H_ _[≺]_ with _n_ vertices. Moreover,


they established a polynomial bound on the edge-ordered Ramsey number of graphs with bounded


degeneracy. Lastly, they extended this result to graphs where each edge carries a label (with no


inherent ordering imposed on the labels).


Erd˝os et al. [16] defined the size-Ramsey number as follows.


**Definition 1.3.** _For graphs G and H, the size-Ramsey number_ ˆ _r_ ( _G, H_ ) _is the smallest number m_


_such that there exists a graph F on m edges such that any_ 2 _-coloring of the edges of F_ _, there exists_


_either a red copy of G or a blue copy of H._


If _G_ = _H_, then we write ˆ _r_ ( _G_ ) for short, instead of ˆ _r_ ( _G, G_ ).


The concept of size Ramsey numbers enables more precise investigation of the minimality of


the target graph _F_ . One can always select a sufficiently large complete graph to serve as the

target graph _F_, so - _r_ ( _G,H_ )� forms a trivial upper bound for ˆ _r_ ( _G, H_ ). This bound is also tight
2

when _G, H_ are both complete graphs [16], but for other graphs _G, H_, the optimal target graph is


typically far sparser. For additional recent findings regarding the size-Ramsey numbers of graphs,


see [8, 9, 12, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28].


Fox and Li [20] extended this to edge-ordered graphs, defining the size edge-ordered Ramsey


number to capture the minimum number of edges needed to force a monochromatic edge-ordered


subgraph.


**Definition 1.4.** _For edge-ordered graphs G_ _[≺]_ _and H_ _[≺]_ _, the size edge-ordered Ramsey number_

_r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) _is defined as the minimum number m such that there exists an edge-ordered graph_

_F_ _[≺]_ _of F with m edges such that any_ 2 _-coloring of the edges of F_ _[≺]_ _has a red edge-ordered copy of_

_G_ _[≺]_ _or a blue edge-ordered copy of H_ _[≺]_ _._


If _G_ _[≺]_ = _H_ _[≺]_, then we write ˆ _r_ edge ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) for short, instead of ˆ _r_ edge ( _G_ _[≺]_ _, G_ _[≺]_ ).

A trivial yet critical observation is that ˆ _r_ ( _G, H_ ) _≤_ _r_ ˆedge( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) holds for any edge-ordered

graphs _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ . This is because the size edge-ordered Ramsey number needs to consider both the

underlying graph structure and its edge order. Similarly, for edge-ordered graphs _G_ _[≺]_ and _H_ _[≺]_, we



also have




        - _r_ edge( _G≺, H_ _≺_ )�
_r_ ˆ( _G, H_ ) _≤_ _r_ ˆedge( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) _≤_ _._ (2)

**Proposition 1.1.** _If G_ _[≺]_ _is an edge-ordered subgraph of H_ _[≺]_ _, then_


_r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _≤_ _r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ) _._


_Proof._ Let _m_ = ˆ _r_ edge( _H_ _[≺]_ ). By definition there exists an edge-ordered graph _F_ _[≺]_ satisfying _|E_ ( _F_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ =

_m_ and any 2-coloring of the edges of _F_ _[≺]_ contains a monochromatic edge-ordered copy of _H_ _[≺]_ . Since

_G_ _[≺]_ is an edge-ordered subgraph of _H_ _[≺]_, it follows that there is a monochromatic edge-ordered graph

_H_ _[≺]_, then ˆ _r_ edge( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _≤_ _r_ ˆedge( _H_ _[≺]_ ) _._


We define the edge-ordered book graph _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [by endowing the book graph] _[ B][m,n]_ [with an edge]

order. Let the vertices of the spine be _u_ 1 _, . . ., um_ and the vertices of the pages be _v_ 1 _, . . ., vn_ .

The edge order _≺Bm,n_ is specified as follows: for any two spine edges ( _ui, uj_ ) and ( _us, ut_ ) with

1 _≤_ _i < j ≤_ _m_ and 1 _≤_ _s < t ≤_ _n_, we have


( _ui, uj_ ) _≺Bm,n_ ( _us, ut_ ) _⇐⇒_ ( _i < s_ ) or ( _i_ = _s_ and _j < t_ ) _,_


and for any two page-spine edges ( _vi, uj_ ) and ( _vs, ut_ ), we have


( _um−_ 1 _, um_ ) _≺Bm,n_ ( _vi, uj_ ) _≺Bm,n_ ( _vs, ut_ ) _⇐⇒_ ( _i < s_ ) or ( _i_ = _s_ and _j < t_ ) _._


Edge-ordered bipartite graph _H_ _[≺]_ : the underlying graph is a bipartite graph _H_ with two partite


sets _A_ and _B_ . Let _V_ ( _A_ ) = _{u_ 1 _, . . ., us}_ and _V_ ( _B_ ) = _{v_ 1 _, . . ., vt}_ . The edge order _≺H_ is defined

as the vertex lexicographical order: for any two edges ( _ui, vj_ ) and ( _uk, vl_ ) with 1 _≤_ _i < j ≤_ _s_ and


1 _≤_ _k < l ≤_ _t_, we have


( _ui, vj_ ) _≺H_ ( _uk, vl_ ) _⇐⇒_ ( _i < k_ ) or ( _i_ = _k_ and _j < l_ ) _._


All subsequent bipartite graphs satisfy this edge order. In particular, we denote the edge-ordered

complete bipartite graph as _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [.]


A question was asked by Fox and Li [20] for size edge-ordered Ramsey numbers.


**Problem 1.** [20] _What families of edge-ordered graphs, have linear or near-linear size edge-ordered_


_Ramsey number?_


Motivated by Problem 1, we study the size edge-ordered Ramsey number of graphs. Our results


are as follows.

  - For any _m ≥_ 25 and every _n ≥_ 300 _m_ [2], Conlon et al. [15] showed that ˆ _r_ ( _Bm,n_ ) _≥_ _m_ 2 _[m]_ _n_ [2] _/_ 1200 _._

In Section 2, we use Szemer´edi’s regularity lemma to prove that ˆ _r_ edge( _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [(2] _[m]_ [2][ +]

_m_ 2 _[m]_ [+2] ) _n_ [2] _−_ _mn._ From (2), we have ˆ _r_ edge( _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [) = Θ(] _[m]_ [2] _[m][n]_ [2][) for sufficiently large] _[ n]_ [ and a]


fixed integer _m_ (Theorem 2.5).


  - Theorem 2.5 and (2) show that ˆ _r_ edge( _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [) = Θ(] _[m]_ [2] _[m][n]_ [2][). This together with Proposition]


1.1 show that even for sparse graphs like book graphs, its size edge-ordered Ramsey number


can not be linear or near-linear. Therefore, we consider Problem 1 for some bipartite graphs.

In Subsection 3.1, we establish that _mK_ 2 _[≺]_ [and] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [exhibit a linear relationship in] _[ m]_ [, namely]

_r_ ˆedge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) = 3] _[m]_ [ for all integers] _[ m][ ≥]_ [2 and any edge-ordered path with 4 vertices (The-]

orem 3.1). In Subsection 3.2, we prove that 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [and] _[ K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [satisfy a near-linear relationship in]

large _t_ (Theorem 3.3). For any integers _m ≥_ 3 and _t ≥_ _s ≥_ 1, we further derive the upper and

lower bounds for ˆ _r_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [). Furthermore, both the upper and lower bounds are tight]

(Theorem 3.5). In Subsection 3.3, we show that the edge-ordered complete bipartite graph

_Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [satisfies a linear relationship in] _[ t]_ [ for large] _[ t]_ [, that is, ˆ] _[r]_ [edge][(] _[K]_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ _[, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[s]_ [2][(] _[n][ −]_ [1) +] _[ st]_ [ for]


any positive integers _n, s, t_, and this upper bound is sharp (Theorem 3.6). For any integers

_t ≥_ _s ≥_ 2, we have ˆ _r_ edge( _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[es]_ [2][2] _[s]_ [+2] _[t]_ [, and this upper bound is sharp for large] _[ t]_ [ (Theorem]


3.7).

### **2 Non-linear results**


We first introduce some definitions and theorems to be used in the following.


**Definition 2.1.** _Given a graph G with nonempty, disjoint vertex subsets X and Y, the density of_


_the pair_ ( _X, Y_ ) _is defined as_

_d_ ( _X, Y_ ) = _[e]_ [(] _[X, Y]_ [ )]

_|X||Y |_ _[,]_


_where e_ ( _X, Y_ ) _denotes the number of edges with one endpoint in X and the other in Y ._


We denote this by _d_ ( _v, Y_ ) when _X_ = _{v}_ .


**Definition 2.2.** _Given ϵ >_ 0 _and a graph G, for two disjoint nonempty vertex subsets X and_


_Y, the pair_ ( _X, Y_ ) _is called ϵ-regular if for every A ⊆_ _X and B ⊆_ _Y such that |A| ≥_ _ϵ|X| and_


_|B| ≥_ _ϵ|Y |,_


_|d_ ( _A, B_ ) _−_ _d_ ( _X, Y_ ) _| ≤_ _ϵ._


In particular, a vertex subset _X_ is said to be _ϵ-regular_ if the pair ( _X, X_ ) is _ϵ_ -regular.


**Definition 2.3.** _An equitable partition of a graph G is a partition of its vertex set V_ ( _G_ ) = _V_ 1 _∪_

_· · · ∪_ _Vk, where the subsets Vi are nonempty and disjoint, and_ �� _|Vi| −|Vj|_ �� _≤_ 1 _for all_ 1 _≤_ _i, j ≤_ _k._

We appeal to the following strengthened version of Szemer´edi’s regularity lemma, whose proof


appears in [14].


**Theorem 2.1.** [14] For any _ϵ >_ 0 and integer _m_ 0 _≥_ 0, there exists an integer _M_ = _M_ ( _m_ 0 _, ϵ_ ) _> m_ 0,

and for every graph _G_, there exists an equitable partition _V_ ( _G_ ) = _V_ 1 _∪_ _. . . ∪_ _Vk_, which satisfies

_m_ 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M_ and


(1) each part _Vi_ is _ϵ_ -regular,


(2) for every 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _k_, there are at most _ϵk_ values 1 _≤_ _j ≤_ _k_ such that the pair ( _Vi, Vj_ ) is


_ϵ_ -irregular.


We additionally require the following consequence of the counting lemma, whose proof is given


in [14]. Let _Q_ be a copy of clique _Kn_ in a graph _G_ . A vertex _u ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ ) is said to _extend Q_ if _u_ is


a common neighbor of all _n_ vertices of _Q_ .


**Theorem 2.2.** [14] Fix an integer _n ≥_ 2, and let _ϵ, δ ∈_ �0 _,_ [1] - satisfy _ϵ ≤_ _δ_ [3] _[n]_ [2] . Suppose _X_ is a

2

vertex subset of a graph _G_ which is _ϵ_ -regular and has edge density at least _δ_ . Then _X_ contains at


least one _Kn_ . Furthermore, if _Q_ is a uniformly random _Kn_ copy in _X_, then for _∀_ _u ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ ),


Pr� _u_ extends _Q_               - _≥_ _d_ ( _u, X_ ) _[n]_ _−_ _δ._


**Definition 2.4.** [15] Fix an integer _k ≥_ 2 and _ϵ, δ ∈_ (0 _,_ 1). Let _G_ be a 2-colored graph and


_V_ 1 _, . . ., Vk_ be disjoint vertex subsets of _G_ . We define _{V_ 1 _, . . ., Vk}_ as a ( _k, ϵ, δ_ )-good configuration


if it satisfies the following conditions:


(1) _V_ 1 _∪· · · ∪_ _Vk_ induces a complete subgraph of _G_, that is, any two distinct vertices from


this union are connected by an edge in _G_ .


(2) Each _Vi_ is _ϵ_ -regular in the red subgraph, with internal red edge density at least _δ_ .


(3) All pairs ( _Vi, Vj_ ) for 1 _≤_ _i < j ≤_ _k_ are _ϵ_ -regular in the blue subgraph, with blue edge


density at least _δ_ .


The following lemma indicates that colorings with ( _k, ϵ, δ_ )-good configurations also contain


large monochromatic books, as shown in [15].


**Theorem 2.3.** [15] Fix _k ≥_ 2, 0 _< δ ≤_ 2 _[−][k][−]_ [1], and 0 _< ϵ ≤_ _δ_ [3] _[k]_ [2] . Suppose the edges of graph _G_ are


2-colored, with _V_ 1 _, . . ., Vk_ being a ( _k, ϵ, δ_ )-good configuration in _G_ . If the vertices in _V_ 1 _∪· · · ∪_ _Vk_

have _t_ common neighbors in _G_, then the coloring contains a monochromatic _Bk,_ 2 _−k−_ 1 _t_ .


**Theorem 2.4.** [10] Given a graph _G_ with _n_ vertices, the maximum number of edges in a _Km_ -free

subgraph of _G_ is �1 _−_ 1 - _n_ 2
_m−_ 1 2 [.]

The proof idea of the following theorem is from [15].


**Theorem 2.5.** _Let m be an integer with m ≥_ 2 _. If n is sufficiently large, then_


_r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [(2] _[m]_ [2][ +] _[ m]_ [2] _[m]_ [+2][)] _[n]_ [2] _[ −]_ _[mn.]_


_Proof._ Let _G_ _[≺]_ = _B_ _[≺]_ �2 _mn_ - + 2 _mn ·_ 2 _[m]_ [+1] _n_ = (2 _m_ [2] + _m_ 2 _[m]_ [+2] ) _n_ [2] _−_ _mn_ .
2 _mn,_ 2 _[m]_ [+1] _n_ [. Then] _[ |][E]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ [)] _[|]_ [ =] 2

Let _δ_ = min _{_ 2 _[−][m][−]_ [1] _,_ 1
10 _m_ [3] _[}]_ [,] _[ ϵ]_ [ =] _[ δ]_ [3] _[m]_ [2][, and] _[ m]_ [0][ = 10] _[m]_ [2][. Fix a 2-coloring] _[ χ]_ [ of] _[ G][≺]_ [, by applying]

Theorem 2.1, we analyze the red graph corresponding to the spine-induced subgraph of _G_ _[≺]_ . Then


there exists an equitable partition _V_ 1 _∪_ _. . . ∪_ _Vk_, which satisfies _m_ 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M_ and each part _Vi_ is

_ϵ_ -regular, and for every 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _k_, there are at most _ϵk_ values 1 _≤_ _j ≤_ _k_ such that the pair ( _Vi, Vj_ )


is _ϵ_ -irregular.


**Fact 1.** _If_ ( _Vi, Vj_ ) _is ϵ-regular in red subgraph, then_ ( _Vi, Vj_ ) _is also ϵ-regular in blue subgraph._


We refer to a part _Vi_ as _red_ if at least half of its internal edges are red; otherwise, we term it


_blue_ . Without loss of generality, assume that at least half of the parts are red. Relabel these red



parts as _V_ 1 _, . . ., Vk′_ where 5 _m_ [2] = _⌈_ _[m]_ [0]

vertex set _{v_ 1 _, . . ., vk′}_ . An edge _vivj_ exists in _F_ if the pair ( _Vi, Vj_ ) is _ϵ_ -regular and its blue edge


density is at least _δ_ .


**Case 1.** _δ_ ( _F_ ) _>_ (1 _−_ 1
_m−_ 1 [)] _[k][′][.]_


As _δ_ ( _F_ ) _>_ (1 _−_ 1 1
_m−_ 1 [)] _[k][′]_ [, we have] _[ |][E]_ [(] _[F]_ [)] _[|][ >]_ [ (1] _[ −]_ _m−_ 1 [)] _[k]_ 2 _[′]_ [2] [. Applying Theorem][ 2.4][, we find that] _[ F]_

contains a copy of _Km_ . Let _vi_ 1 _, . . ., vim_ be the vertices of this _Km_, and let _V_ 1 = _Vi_ 1 _, . . ., Vm_ = _Vim_ .

Observe that all vertices in _V_ 1 _∪· · · ∪_ _Vm_ lie in the spine of _G_ _[≺]_ . This union induces a complete

subgraph in _G_ _[≺]_ . In addition, each _Vi_ is _ϵ_ -regular in the red subgraph and its red edge density of at

least [1]

2 _[≥]_ _[δ]_ [. Furthermore, all pairs (] _[V][i][, V][j]_ [) with 1] _[ ≤]_ _[i < j][ ≤]_ _[m]_ [ are] _[ ϵ]_ [-regular in the blue subgraph]

and its blue edge density of at least _δ_ . We conclude that _{V_ 1 _, . . ., Vm}_ forms a ( _m, ϵ, δ_ )-good

configuration by Definition 2.4. The vertices in _V_ 1 _∪· · ·∪_ _Vm_ have 2 _[m]_ [+1] _n_ common neighbors in _G_ _[≺]_ .

By Theorem 2.3, it follows that a monochromatic _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [exists under the coloring] _[ χ]_ [. Given that]

_Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [is a subgraph of] _[ G][≺]_ [, it follows that its edge order is preserved. In other words, we obtain a]

monochromatic edge-ordered _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [, as required.]


**Case 2.** _There exists a vertex in F with degree at most_ �1 _−_ 1 - _k_ _[′]_ _._
_m−_ 1


Without loss of generality, we denote this vertex by _v_ 1, where _dF_ ( _v_ 1) _≤_ �1 _−_ _m_ 1 _−_ 1  - _k_ _[′]_ . Then

there are at most �1 _−_ _m_ 1 _−_ 1 - _k_ _[′]_ parts _Vj_ (with 2 _≤_ _j ≤_ _k_ _[′]_ ) satisfying that the pair ( _V_ 1 _, Vj_ ) is _ϵ_ -regular

_k_ _[′]_
and has blue edge density of at least _δ_ . As a result, we obtain at least
_m−_ 1 _[−]_ [1 parts] _[ V][j]_ [ (with]

2 _≤_ _j ≤_ _k_ _[′]_ ) for which the pair ( _V_ 1 _, Vj_ ) is either _ϵ_ -irregular or its blue edge density is less than _δ_ .

Thus, let _U_ denote the set of indices _j_ with 2 _≤_ _j ≤_ _k_ _[′]_ such that the pair ( _V_ 1 _, Vj_ ) is _ϵ_ -regular and


7


has blue edge density less than _δ_ . From Theorem 2.1, the number of _ϵ_ -irregular pairs ( _V_ 1 _, Vj_ ) is no

more than _ϵk_ . Note that _k_ _[′]_ _≥_ 5 _m_ [2] and _ϵ ≤_ _δ ≤_ 101 _m_ [3] [for] _[ m][ ≥]_ [2. Then]

Observe that _V_ 1 is _ϵ_ -regular and its red density is at least [1] 2 _[≥]_ _[δ]_ [ and] _[ ϵ]_ [ =] _[ δ]_ [3] _[m]_ [2][. Theorem][ 2.2]

guarantees that _V_ 1 contains at least one red _Km_ . For a uniformly random red _Km_ copy _Q_ in _V_ 1, the

probability of any vertex _u ∈_ _W_ extending _Q_ is no less than _dR_ - _u, V_ 1� _m −_ _δ_, with _dR_ representing

the edge density in the red graph. We define a random variable _Yu_ for each vertex _u ∈_ _W_, which


takes the value 1 if and only if _u_ extends _Q_, and 0 otherwise. Thus, _Yu_ is a Bernoulli random


variable, and


E[ _Yu_ ] = Pr( _Yu_ = 1) = Pr ( _u_ extends _Q_ ) _._

Since _U_ is defined as the set of indices _j_ satisfying 2 _≤_ _j ≤_ _k_ _[′]_, ( _V_ 1 _, Vj_ ) is _ϵ_ -regular, and its blue

_y ≥_ 0, and the last inequality follows from 2 _mδ ≤_ 5 _m_ 1 [2] _[≤]_ _[m]_ _m_ _[−]_ [1] for _m ≥_ 2.

Consequently, there exists a red _Km_ in _V_ 1 that has at least _n_ red extensions, i.e., a red _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [.]

Given that _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [is a subgraph of] _[ G][≺]_ [, it follows that its edge order is preserved. In other words,]

we obtain a monochromatic edge-ordered _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [, as required.]


For any _m ≥_ 25 and every _n ≥_ 300 _m_ [2], ˆ _r_ ( _Bm,n_ ) _≥_ _m_ 2 _[m]_ _n_ [2] _/_ 1200, a result established in [15]. By


Theorem 2.5 and (2), we have the following corollary:


**Corollary 2.6.** ˆ _redge_ ( _Bm,n_ _[≺]_ [) = Θ(] _[m]_ [2] _[m][n]_ [2][)] _[ for sufficiently large][ n][ and a fixed integer][ m][.]_

### **3 Linear and near-linear results**


From Corollary 2.6, both the lower and upper bounds are nonlinear. This implies that even sparse


book graphs fail to admit linear bounds, which makes the search for graphs with linear bounds


challenging. Hence, our focus is directed toward graph classes such as bipartite graph.

#### **3.1 Matchings versus small paths**

Turning to Problem 1, we first derive foundational observations about size edge-ordered Ramsey


numbers for matchings and general edge-ordered graphs, then focus on specific families to verify


linearity. We begin with two key inequalities that guide our analysis.

Let _G_ _[≺]_ be an edge-ordered graph with _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = _q_ . For _n ∈_ N, _nG_ _[≺]_ denotes _n_ vertex-disjoint

copies _G_ _[≺]_ 1 _[, . . ., G]_ _n_ _[≺]_ [of] _[ G][≺]_ [, where each] _[ G]_ _i_ _[≺]_ [has edge set] _[ {][e][i]_ [1] _[, . . ., e][iq][}]_ [ satisfying] _[ e][i]_ [1] _[ ≺]_ _[e][i]_ [2] _[ ≺· · · ≺]_ _[e][iq]_
for 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _n._ The edge order of _nG_ _[≺]_ is defined as follows,


_eij ≺_ _ekl ⇐⇒_ _i < k_ or ( _i_ = _k_ and _j < l_ ) _._


For edge-ordered graphs _F_ _[≺]_ _, G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_, we define _F_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) to mean that any 2-coloring

of the edges of _F_ _[≺]_ contains either a red edge-ordered copy of _G_ _[≺]_ or a blue edge-ordered copy of

_H_ _[≺]_ .


**Proposition 3.1.** _For edge-ordered graphs F_ _[≺]_ _, G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ _, we have_


_r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _mG_ _[≺]_ _, nH_ _[≺]_ ) _≤_ ( _m_ + _n −_ 1)ˆ _redge_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) _._ (5)


_Specifically, when G_ = _K_ 2 _and n_ = 1 _, we have_


max _{m, |E_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ) _|} ≤_ _r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[m][r]_ [ˆ] _[edge]_ [(] _[K]_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ m][|][E]_ [(] _[H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[|][.]_ (6)


_Proof._ Let _F_ _[≺]_ be a edge-ordered graph with ˆ _r_ edge( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) edges such that _F_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ). We

first prove that ( _m_ + _n −_ 1) _F_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _mG_ _[≺]_ _, nH_ _[≺]_ ). Recall that ( _m_ + _n −_ 1) _F_ _[≺]_ denotes _m_ + _n −_ 1

vertex-disjoint copies of _F_ _[≺]_, denoted _F_ 1 _[≺][, F]_ 2 _[ ≺][, . . ., F][ ≺]_ _m_ + _n−_ 1 [, with the edge order defined as follows:]

for any edges _e ∈_ _E_ ( _Fi_ _[≺]_ [) and] _[ f][ ∈]_ _[E]_ [(] _[F]_ _j_ _[ ≺]_ [),] _[ e][ ≺]_ _[f]_ [ if and only if] _[ i < j]_ [, or] _[ i]_ [ =] _[ j]_ [ and] _[ e][ ≺]_ _[f]_ [ in the]

original edge order of _F_ _[≺]_ .

Consider any 2-coloring (red/blue) of the edges of ( _m_ + _n −_ 1) _F_ _[≺]_ . For each copy _Fk_ _[≺]_ [(1] _[ ≤]_ _[k][ ≤]_

_m_ + _n −_ 1), the hypothesis _F_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) implies that _Fk_ _[≺]_ [contains either a red edge-ordered]

copy of _G_ _[≺]_ or a blue edge-ordered copy of _H_ _[≺]_ . By the pigeonhole principle, among these _m_ + _n_ _−_ 1

copies, there must exist either at least _m_ copies each containing a red edge-ordered copy of _G_ _[≺]_ or

at least _n_ copies each containing a blue edge-ordered copy of _H_ _[≺]_ .


We verify the edge-order consistency for the red case (the blue case is symmetric). Let

_Fi_ _[≺]_ 1 _[, . . ., F][ ≺]_ _im_ [(] _[i]_ [1] _[ <][ · · ·][ < i][m]_ [) be the copies containing red] _[ G][≺]_ [copies, denoted] _[ G]_ 1 _[≺]_ _[⊆]_ _[F]_ _i_ _[ ≺]_ 1 _[, . . ., G]_ _m_ _[≺]_ _[⊆]_

_Fi_ _[≺]_ _m_ [. For any edges] _[ e][ ∈]_ _[G]_ _a_ _[≺]_ [and] _[ f][ ∈]_ _[G]_ _b_ _[≺]_ [with] _[ a < b]_ [, since] _[ i][a][ < i][b]_ [, we have] _[ e][ ≺]_ _[f]_ [ by the order of]

( _m_ + _n −_ 1) _F_ _[≺]_ . For edges within _G_ _[≺]_ _a_ [, their order inherits the original edge-order of] _[ G][≺]_ [. Thus,]

_G_ _[≺]_ 1 _[∪· · · ∪]_ _[G]_ _m_ _[≺]_ [is a red edge-ordered copy of] _[ mG][≺]_ [. Hence, (] _[m]_ [ +] _[ n][ −]_ [1)] _[F][ ≺]_ _[→]_ [(] _[mG][≺][, nH]_ _[≺]_ [).]

Next, we derive Inequality (5). From the transitivity result above, ( _m_ + _n−_ 1) _F_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _mG_ _[≺]_ _, nH_ _[≺]_ ),


then

_r_ ˆedge( _mG_ _[≺]_ _, nH_ _[≺]_ ) _≤_ ( _m_ + _n −_ 1)ˆ _r_ edge( _G_ _[≺]_ _, H_ _[≺]_ ) _._


10


We now focus on the special case where _G_ = _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [and] _[ n]_ [ = 1, leading to Inequality (][6][). For the]

lower bound, to contain a monochromatic _mK_ 2 _[≺]_ [or a monochromatic] _[ H]_ _[≺]_ [, the graph must have]

at least _m_ or _|E_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ edges, respectively. Thus, the lower bound is the maximum of these two


values.

Note that ˆ _r_ edge( _K_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ |][E]_ [(] _[H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[|]_ [. Substituting] _[ G]_ [ =] _[ K]_ 2 _[≺]_ [and] _[ n]_ [ = 1 into Inequality (][5][), we]

get

_r_ ˆedge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [(] _[m]_ [ + 1] _[ −]_ [1)ˆ] _[r]_ [edge][(] _[K]_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ m][|][E]_ [(] _[H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[|][.]_


Combining the lower and upper bounds, we have


max _{m, |E_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ) _|} ≤_ _r_ ˆedge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[m][|][E]_ [(] _[H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[|][.]_


A key link to size-Ramsey numbers is as follows.


**Proposition 3.2.** _If_ ˆ _r_ - _mK_ 2 _, H_ - = _m_ �� _E_ ( _H_ )�� _, then_ ˆ _redge_ - _mK_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [�] = _m_ �� _E_ - _H_ _[≺]_ [���] _for any edge-_

_ordered graph H_ _[≺]_ _._


_Proof._ By (2), we have


_r_ ˆedge ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≥]_ _[r]_ [ˆ][ (] _[mK]_ [2] _[, H]_ [) =] _[ m][|][E]_ [(] _[H]_ [)] _[|]_ [ =] _[ m][ |][E]_ [ (] _[H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[|][ .]_


Combined with (6), it follows that ˆ _r_ edge ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, H]_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ m][ |][E]_ [ (] _[H]_ _[≺]_ [)] _[|]_ [.]


Let _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [1][,] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [2][,] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [3] denote edge-ordered paths with vertex set _{vi_ : 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ 4 _}_ and edge set

_{ei_ = _vivi_ +1 : 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ 3 _}_, where the edge orderings are given by


_P_ 4 _[≺]_ [1] : _e_ 1 _≺_ _e_ 2 _≺_ _e_ 3 _,_ _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [2] : _e_ 1 _≺_ _e_ 3 _≺_ _e_ 2 _,_ _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [3] : _e_ 2 _≺_ _e_ 1 _≺_ _e_ 3 _._


To establish linearity for _mK_ 2 _[≺]_ [and] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [, where] _[ P][ ≺]_ 4 _[∈{][P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [1] _[, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [2] _[, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [3] _[}]_ [, we first analyze the base]

case _m_ = 2.


**Lemma 3.1.** _For any edge-ordered P_ 4 _[≺]_ _[∈{][P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [1] _[, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [2] _[, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [3] _[}][, we have]_ [ ˆ] _[r][edge]_ [(2] _[K]_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) = 6] _[.]_


_Proof._ For the upper bound, by Inequality (6), we have ˆ _r_ edge(2 _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [2] _[|][E]_ [(] _[P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [)] _[| ≤]_ [6] _[.]_

For the lower bound, we show that every edge-ordered graph _G_ _[≺]_ with _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = 5 exists a

red/blue coloring avoiding both a red edge-ordered 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [and a blue edge-ordered] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [. We first]

consider a special case.


**Case 1.** _G_ _[≺]_ _does not contain P_ 4 _[≺]_ _[as an edge-ordered subgraph.]_


Color all edges of _G_ _[≺]_ blue. In this coloring, there are no red edges, so there cannot exist a red

edge-ordered 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [. Since] _[ G][≺]_ [has no edge-ordered] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [subgraph, there is no blue edge-ordered] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [.]


11


**Case 2.** _G_ _[≺]_ _contains P_ 4 _[≺]_ _[as an edge-ordered subgraph.]_


We classify _G_ _[≺]_ by the longest path in its underlying graph. Assume the longest path is _P_ 6

(Figure (a)): Color edges _v_ 1 _v_ 2 and _v_ 2 _v_ 3 red, and the remaining edges blue. The red edges are

adjacent (sharing _v_ 2), so there is no red edge-ordered 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [. The blue edges form] _[ P][ ≺]_ 2 _[∪]_ _[P][ ≺]_ 3 [, which]

cannot be isomorphic to _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [.]

Assume the longest path is _P_ 5 or _P_ 4. These graphs are shown in Figures (b)-(h) (longest


path _P_ 5) and (i)-(o) (longest path _P_ 4). For Figures (c)-(o), color edges _v_ 1 _v_ 2 and _v_ 2 _v_ 3 red, and

the remaining edges blue. The red edges are adjacent (sharing _v_ 2), so there is no red 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [. The]

underlying graph of the blue edges contains no _P_ 4 subgraph, so there is no blue _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [.]

Figure 1: Some graphs with 5 edges



Note that _G_ _[≺]_ = _C_ 5 _[≺]_ [(Figure (b)) contains] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [. We analyze this case based on the edge-order]

of _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [. Assume that] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [=] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [1][. Without loss of generality, let] _[ e]_ [1] _[≺]_ _[e]_ [2] _[≺]_ _[e]_ [3][. If] _[ e]_ [4] _[≺]_ _[e]_ [3][, color]

edges _e_ 1 and _e_ 5 red, and the remaining edges blue. The blue edges satisfy the edge-order _e_ 2 _≺_ _e_ 3
and _e_ 4 _≺_ _e_ 3. If _e_ 3 _≺_ _e_ 4 and _e_ 5 _≺_ _e_ 4, color edges _e_ 1 and _e_ 2 red, and the remaining edges blue. The

blue edges satisfy the edge-order _e_ 3 _≺_ _e_ 4 and _e_ 5 _≺_ _e_ 4. If _e_ 3 _≺_ _e_ 4 _≺_ _e_ 5, color edges _e_ 3 and _e_ 4 red,

and the remaining edges blue. The blue edges satisfy the edge-order _e_ 1 _≺_ _e_ 2 _≺_ _e_ 5.

Assume that _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [=] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [2][. Without loss of generality, let] _[ e]_ [1] _[≺]_ _[e]_ [3] _[≺]_ _[e]_ [2] [(where the middle edge]

_e_ 2 has the maximum order). Color edges _e_ 1 and _e_ 5 red, and the remaining edges blue. Note that

_e_ 3 _≺_ _e_ 2, so the middle edge _e_ 3 does not have the maximum order in the blue subgraph.

Similarly, assume that _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [=] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [3] . Without loss of generality, let _e_ 2 _≺_ _e_ 1 _≺_ _e_ 3 (where the

middle edge _e_ 1 has the minimum order). Color edges _e_ 1 and _e_ 5 red, and the remaining edges blue.


12


Note that _e_ 2 _≺_ _e_ 3, so the middle edge _e_ 1 does not have the minimum order in the blue subgraph.

In all the above colorings, there is no red edge-ordered 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [and no blue edge-ordered] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [.]

Thus, ˆ _r_ edge(2 _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [)] _[ ≥]_ [6.]


Using Lemma 3.1 as the base case, we generalize to arbitrary _m_ via induction, establishing

linearity for _mK_ 2 _[≺]_ [and edge-ordered] _[ P][ ≺]_ 4 [.]


**Theorem 3.1.** _For any integer m ≥_ 2 _and any edge-ordered P_ 4 _[≺]_ _[∈{][P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [1] _[, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [2] _[, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [3] _[}][, we have]_


_r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) = 3] _[m.]_


_Proof._ For the upper bound, we have ˆ _r_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [3] _[m]_ [ by (][6][). For the lower bound, let]


_R_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) =] _[ {][G][≺]_ [:] _[ G][≺]_ _[→]_ [(] _[mK]_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) but] _[ G][′≺]_ [↛] [(] _[mK]_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) for any] _[ G][′≺]_ [⊊] _[G][≺][}][.]_


Take any minimal Ramsey subgraph _G_ _[≺]_ _∈R_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). We prove] _[ |][E]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ [)] _[| ≥]_ [3] _[m]_ [ by induction]

on _m_ . For _m_ = 2, this follows directly from Lemma 3.1. Assume that it holds for _m −_ 1, then we


consider the case for _m_ below.


**Claim 1.** _For any vertex v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _, we have G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v →_ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [)] _[ and][ |][E]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ _[−]_ _[v]_ [)] _[| ≥]_

3( _m −_ 1) _._


_Proof._ Assume for contradiction that there exists a vertex _v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) such that _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ ↛

(( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [), that is, there exists a red/blue coloring] _[ χ]_ [ of] _[ G][≺]_ _[−]_ _[v]_ [ such that] _[ G][≺]_ _[−]_ _[v]_ [ contains]

neither a red edge-ordered ( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [nor a blue edge-ordered] _[ P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [.]

Extend _χ_ to a coloring of _G_ _[≺]_ by coloring all edges incident to _v_ red. We verify that this extension

avoids both forbidden subgraphs. Since _χ_ contains no blue edge-ordered _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [in] _[ G][≺]_ _[−]_ _[v]_ [, and all]

edges incident to _v_ are red, it follows that there is no blue edge-ordered _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [in] _[ G][≺]_ [. Furthermore,]

_χ_ contains at most _m −_ 2 pairwise disjoint red edges in _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ . The red edges incident to _v_ all

share the vertex _v_, so they cannot form additional pairwise disjoint red edges with those in _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ .

Thus, _G_ _[≺]_ contains at most _m −_ 1 pairwise disjoint red edges. This contradicts the assumption

that _G_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [).]

Let _H_ _[≺]_ be a minimal Ramsey subgraph of _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ for (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). By the induction]

hypothesis, _|E_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ 3( _m_ _−_ 1). Since _H_ _[≺]_ _⊆_ _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_, we have _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ ) _| ≥|E_ ( _H_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ 3( _m_ _−_ 1).


Hence, Claim 1 holds.


**Case 1.** _There exists a vertex v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _with dG≺_ ( _v_ ) _≥_ 3 _._


By Claim 1, _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ ) _| ≥_ 3( _m −_ 1). Thus,


_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = _dG≺_ ( _v_ ) + _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ ) _| ≥_ 3 + 3( _m −_ 1) = 3 _m._

**Case 2.** _Every vertex v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _has dG≺_ ( _v_ ) _≤_ 2 _._


If every vertex _v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) has _dG≺_ ( _v_ ) _≤_ 2, then _G_ _[≺]_ is a disjoint union of edge-ordered paths

and cycles. Since _G_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [), it follows that each connected component of] _[ G][≺]_ [must]

contain _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [as an edge-ordered subgraph. Otherwise, suppose some components do not contain]

_P_ 4 _[≺]_ [as an edge-ordered subgraph. Color all edges of these components blue, and color the edges of]

the remaining components arbitrarily. In this coloring, any red edge-ordered _mK_ 2 _[≺]_ [or blue edge-]

ordered _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [must lie entirely within the remaining components (as the blue-colored components]

contain no _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [). However, the subgraph induced by these remaining components (denoted] _[ G][′≺]_ [)]

satisfies _G_ _[′≺]_ ⊊ _G_ _[≺]_, which contradicts the minimality assumption that _G_ _[′≺]_ ↛ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) for all]

_G_ _[′≺]_ ⊊ _G_ _[≺]_ . We analyze the components by their type below.


**Claim 2.** _Let any edge-ordered P_ 3 _[≺][, say][ V]_ [ (] _[P]_ 3 _[ ≺]_ [) =] _[ {][u]_ [1] _[, u]_ [2] _[, u]_ [3] _[}][. If][ G][≺]_ _[−][v]_ [ =] _[ P]_ 3 _[ ≺]_ _[∪]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ _[−{][v, u]_ [2] _[}]_ [)] _[ and]_

_G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v →_ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [)] _[ for some vertex][ v][ ∈]_ _[V]_ [ (] _[G][≺]_ [)] _[, then][ G][≺]_ _[−{][v, u]_ [2] _[} →]_ [((] _[m][ −]_ [1)] _[K]_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [)] _[.]_


_Proof._ Assume, for contradiction, that there exists a 2-coloring _χ_ _[′]_ of _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v, u_ 2 _}_ such that

_G_ _[≺]_ _−{v, u_ 2 _}_ ↛ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). Color the edges] _[ u]_ [1] _[u]_ [2] [and] _[ u]_ [2] _[u]_ [3] [blue, and keep the coloring of]

_χ_ _[′]_ in _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v, u_ 2 _}_ unchanged. Since _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v, u_ 2 _}_ ↛ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [) under] _[ χ][′]_ [, it follows that]

_P_ 3 _[≺]_ _[∪]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ _[−{][v, u]_ [2] _[}]_ [)][ ↛] [((] _[m][ −]_ [1)] _[K]_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). Since] _[ G][≺]_ _[−]_ _[v]_ [ =] _[ P]_ 3 _[ ≺]_ _[∪]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ _[−{][v, u]_ [2] _[}]_ [), it follows that]

_G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ ↛ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [), a contradiction.]


**Subcase 2.1.** _G_ _[≺]_ _contains a path component Pn_ _[≺]_ _[for][ n][ ≥]_ [4] _[.]_


Let _V_ ( _Pn_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ {][v]_ [1] _[, v]_ [2] _[, v]_ [3] _[, . . ., v][n][}]_ [. By Claim][ 1][, we have] _[ G][≺]_ _[−]_ _[v]_ [3] _[→]_ [((] _[m][ −]_ [1)] _[K]_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). Note]

that _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ 3 = ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v_ 2 _, v_ 3 _}_ ) _∪{v_ 1 _v_ 2 _}_ . Using the same argument as in Claim 2, we obtain

_G_ _[≺]_ _−{v_ 2 _, v_ 3 _} →_ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). By Claim][ 1][, it follows that] _[ |][E]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ _[−{][v]_ [2] _[, v]_ [3] _[}]_ [)] _[| ≥]_ [3(] _[m][ −]_ [1).]

Therefore,


_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = _dG≺_ ( _v_ 2) + _dG≺_ ( _v_ 3) _−_ 1 + _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v_ 2 _, v_ 3 _}_ ) _| ≥_ 3 + 3( _m −_ 1) = 3 _m._


**Subcase 2.2.** _G_ _[≺]_ _is a graph composed of edge-ordered cycles, that is, G_ _[≺]_ = _Cn_ _[≺]_ 1 [1] _[∪]_ _[C]_ _n_ _[≺]_ 2 [2] _[∪]_ _[. . .]_ _[∪]_ _[C]_ _n_ _[≺]_ _k_ _[k][,]_

_then ni ≥_ 4 _for each_ 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _k._


Suppose that there exists some _i_ with 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _k_ such that _ni_ = 4. Let _V_ ( _C_ 4 _[≺]_ [) =] _[ {][v]_ [1] _[, v]_ [2] _[, v]_ [3] _[, v]_ [4] _[}]_ [.]

By Claim 1, we have _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _v_ 1 _→_ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). Note that] _[ G][≺]_ _[−]_ _[v]_ [1] [=] _[ {][v]_ [2] _[v]_ [3] _[, v]_ [3] _[v]_ [4] _[} ∪]_ [(] _[G][≺]_ _[−]_

_{v_ 2 _, v_ 3 _}_ ). By Claim 2, it follows that _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v_ 2 _, v_ 3 _} →_ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). By Claim][ 1][, we have]

_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v_ 2 _, v_ 3 _}_ ) _| ≥_ 3( _m −_ 1). Thus,


_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = _dG≺_ ( _v_ 1) + _dG≺_ ( _v_ 3) + _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−{v_ 2 _, v_ 3 _}_ ) _| ≥_ 4 + 3( _m −_ 1) _>_ 3 _m._


Suppose that there exists some _i_ with 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _k_ such that _ni ≥_ 6. Let _V_ ( _Cn_ _[≺]_ _i_ [) =] _[ {][v]_ [1] _[, v]_ [2] _[, . . ., v][n]_ _i_ _[}]_ [.]

By Claim 1, we have _G_ _[≺]_ _−_ _vni →_ (( _m −_ 1) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [).] Similarly, by Claim 1, we have _G_ _[≺]_ _−_


14


_{vni, v_ 4 _} →_ (( _m −_ 2) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [).] Note that _G_ _[≺]_ _−{vni, v_ 4 _}_ = _{v_ 1 _v_ 2 _, v_ 2 _v_ 3 _} ∪_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−{vni, v_ 4 _, v_ 2 _}_ ).

Therefore, by Claim 2, it follows that _G_ _[≺]_ _−{vni, v_ 4 _, v_ 2 _} →_ (( _m −_ 2) _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [). By Claim][ 1][, we have]

_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−{vni, v_ 4 _, v_ 2 _}_ ) _| ≥_ 3( _m −_ 2), and hence


_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = _dG≺_ ( _vni_ ) + _dG≺_ ( _v_ 4) + _dG≺_ ( _v_ 2) + _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ _−{vni, v_ 4 _, v_ 2 _}_ ) _| ≥_ 6 + 3( _m −_ 2) = 3 _m._


If _ni_ = 5 for each _i_ (1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _k_ ), then _G_ _[≺]_ = _C_ 5 _[≺]_ [1] _∪_ _. . . ∪_ _C_ 5 _[≺][k]_ . Assume that _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = 3 _m −_ 1.

                       - ~~�~~                       - ~~�~~
_k_

Then 5 _k_ = 3 _m −_ 1.

Color each _C_ 5 _[≺][i]_ according to the coloring in Lemma 3.1 (see Figure (b)) such that _C_ 5 _[≺][i]_ ↛

(2 _K_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [), where 1] _[ ≤]_ _[i][ ≤]_ _[k]_ [. Under this coloring, there are at most] _[ k]_ [ pairwise disjoint red edges]

and no blue edge-ordered _P_ 4 _[≺]_ [. Since] _[ k]_ [ =] [3] _[m]_ 5 _[−]_ [1] _< m_ for _m ≥_ 2, it follows that _G_ _[≺]_ ↛ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, P]_ 4 _[ ≺]_ [),]

a contradiction. Thus, _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ 3 _m_, as desired.

#### **3.2 Small matchings versus complete bipartite graph**


Using classical size-Ramsey results for bipartite graphs, we establish near-linearity for 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_
and _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [in terms of] _[ t]_ [.]


**Theorem 3.2.** [17] _For any integer m ≥_ 1 _and t ≥_ _s ≥_ 2 _, we have_ ˆ _r_ (2 _K_ 2 _, Ks,t_ ) = _st_ + _s_ + _t._


Leveraging Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 3.2, we extend this result to the edge-ordered setting.


**Theorem 3.3.** _For any integers t ≥_ _s ≥_ 2 _, we have_ ˆ _redge_ (2 _K_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ st]_ [ +] _[ s]_ [ +] _[ t][.]_


_Proof._ By (2) and Theorem 3.2, we have ˆ _r_ edge(2 _K_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≥]_ _[r]_ [ˆ][(2] _[K]_ [2] _[, K][s,t]_ [) =] _[ st]_ [+] _[s]_ [+] _[t]_ [. For the upper]

bound, let _F_ _[≺]_ = _Ks_ _[≺]_ +1 _,t_ +1 _[−{][u]_ [1] _[v]_ [1] _[}]_ [ with two partite sets] _[ A]_ [ and] _[ B]_ [ where] _[ V]_ [ (] _[A]_ [) =] _[ {][u]_ [1] _[, . . ., u][s]_ [+1] _[}]_

and _V_ ( _B_ ) = _{v_ 1 _, . . ., vt_ +1 _}_ .

Assume there is no red edge-ordered 2 _K_ 2 _[≺]_ [and we need to show there exists a blue edge-ordered]

_Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [. Since there is no red edge-ordered 2] _[K]_ 2 _[≺]_ [, the red subgraph must be a star (all red edges share]

a common center, otherwise, two edges would be disjoint).


If the center of this red star is in _A_, namely _ui_ for some 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _s_ +1, then the subgraph induced

by _A_ _−{ui}_ and _B −{v_ 1 _}_ is a blue edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [, and inherits the vertex lexicographical order.]

Similarly, if the center of this red star is in _B_, namely _vj_ for some 1 _≤_ _j ≤_ _t_ +1, then the subgraph

induced by _A −{u_ 1 _}_ and _B −{vj}_ is a blue edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [.]

Thus, ˆ _r_ edge(2 _K_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[st]_ [ +] _[ s]_ [ +] _[ t]_ [. Combining the upper and lower bounds, we conclude]

_r_ ˆedge(2 _K_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ st]_ [ +] _[ s]_ [ +] _[ t]_ [.]


Finally, we generalize to arbitrary _m_ for _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [, establishing tight bounds that confirm linearity]


in specific cases.


15


**Theorem 3.4.** [18] _For any integers m ≥_ 1 _and t ≥_ _s ≥_ 1 _, we have_


_r_ ( _mK_ 2 _, Ks,t_ ) = max _{m_ + _s_ + _t −_ 1 _,_ 2 _m_ + _s −_ 1 _}._


**Theorem 3.5.** _For any integers m ≥_ 3 _and t ≥_ _s ≥_ 1 _, we have_


  -  - _m −_ 1��
max _m, st, cs −_ _≤_ _r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [min] - _mst, m_ [2] + _m_ ( _s_ + _t −_ 2) + ( _s −_ 1)( _t −_ 1)� _,_
2


_where c_ = _t_ + _m −_ 1 _if t ≥_ _m and c_ = 2 _m −_ 2 _if t ≤_ _m. Moreover, the bounds are sharp._


_Proof._ We first consider the upper bound. If _m_ [2] + _m_ ( _s_ + _t −_ 2) + ( _s −_ 1)( _t −_ 1) _≥_ _mst_, then

_r_ ˆedge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[mst]_ [ by (][6][).]

Suppose that _mst ≥_ _m_ [2] + _m_ ( _s_ + _t −_ 2) + ( _s −_ 1)( _t −_ 1). Let _F_ _[≺]_ = _Km_ _[≺]_ + _s−_ 1 _,m_ + _t−_ 1 [with partite]

sets _A_ (of size _m_ + _s −_ 1) and _B_ (of size _m_ + _t −_ 1). Then


_|E_ ( _F_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = ( _m_ + _s −_ 1)( _m_ + _t −_ 1) = _m_ [2] + _m_ ( _s_ + _t −_ 2) + ( _s −_ 1)( _t −_ 1) _._


It suffices to show that any red/blue coloring of _F_ _[≺]_ contains either a red edge-ordered _mK_ 2 _[≺]_ [or a]

blue edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [. Assume there is no red edge-ordered] _[ mK]_ 2 _[≺]_ [and no blue edge-ordered] _[ K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [;]

we will derive a contradiction.

Since there is no blue edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [,] _[ F][ ≺]_ [contains at least one red edge. By K¨onig’s Theorem,]


in a bipartite graph, the size of a maximum matching equals the size of a minimum vertex cover.

Without loss of generality, let _M_ be a maximum red matching of _F_ _[≺]_ with _|M_ _| ≤_ _m −_ 1. Then


there exists a minimum vertex cover _C_ of the red subgraph such that _|C|_ = _|M_ _| ≤_ _m −_ 1. Let


_A_ 1 = _A ∩_ _C_, _A_ 2 = _A −_ _A_ 1, _B_ 1 = _B ∩_ _C_, and _B_ 2 = _B −_ _B_ 1. Then _|A_ 1 _|_ + _|B_ 1 _|_ = _|C| ≤_ _m −_ 1, so

_|A_ 1 _| ≤_ _m −_ 1 and _|B_ 1 _| ≤_ _m −_ 1.


All edges between _A_ 2 and _B_ 2 are blue. Otherwise, if there exists a red edge _xy_ with _x ∈_ _A_ 2
and _y ∈_ _B_ 2, then _xy_ would not be covered by _C_ (since _x /∈_ _C_ and _y /∈_ _C_ ), contradicting that _C_ is a


vertex cover of the red subgraph. Thus, the subgraph induced by _A_ 2 and _B_ 2 is a blue edge-ordered

complete bipartite graph _K|_ _[≺]_ _A_ 2 _|,|B_ 2 _|_ [.]

Since _A_ 2 _⊆_ _A_ and _B_ 2 _⊆_ _B_ retain their original vertex labels, the lexicographic edge order of

_K|_ _[≺]_ _A_ 2 _|,|B_ 2 _|_ [inherits from] _[ K]_ _m_ _[≺]_ + _s−_ 1 _,m_ + _t−_ 1 [. As] _[ |][A]_ [1] _[| ≤]_ _[m][ −]_ [1 and] _[ |][B]_ [1] _[| ≤]_ _[m][ −]_ [1, we have]


_|A_ 2 _|_ = _|A| −|A_ 1 _|_ = ( _m_ + _s −_ 1) _−|A_ 1 _| ≥_ _s_


and


_|B_ 2 _|_ = _|B| −|B_ 1 _|_ = ( _m_ + _t −_ 1) _−|B_ 1 _| ≥_ _t._


Thus, we obtain a blue edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [with partite sets] _[ A]_ [2] [and] _[ B]_ [2][, a contradiction. Therefore,]

_r_ ˆedge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[m]_ [2][ +] _[ m]_ [(] _[s]_ [ +] _[ t][ −]_ [2) + (] _[s][ −]_ [1)(] _[t][ −]_ [1).]


16


We now consider the lower bound. If max _{m, st} ≥_ _cs −_  - _m_ 2 _−_ 1�, then ˆ _r_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≥]_

max _{m, st}_ by (6). Suppose that _cs −_ - _m−_ 1� _≥_ max _{m, st}_ . Let
2


_R_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [) =] _[ {][G][≺]_ [:] _[ G][≺]_ _[→]_ [(] _[mK]_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [) but] _[ G][′≺]_ [↛] [(] _[mK]_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [) for any] _[ G][′≺]_ [⊊] _[G][≺][}][.]_


For the lower bound, let _G_ _[≺]_ _∈R_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [) (a minimal edge-ordered Ramsey subgraph). It]

suffices to show that _|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ _cs −_ - _m−_ 1�.
2


**Fact 2.** _δ_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _≥_ _s and G_ _[≺]_ _must contain Ks,t_ _[≺]_ _[as an edge-ordered subgraph.]_


_Proof._ Assume, for contradiction, that there exists a vertex _v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) such that _dG≺_ ( _v_ ) _≤_ _s −_ 1.

Color all edges adjacent to _v_ blue. Since _G_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [), it follows that] _[ G][≺]_ _[−][v][ →]_ [(] _[mK]_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [),]

which contradicts the minimality of _G_ _[≺]_ . Moreover, _G_ _[≺]_ must contain _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [as an edge-ordered]

subgraph. Otherwise, coloring all edges of _G_ _[≺]_ blue would contradict _G_ _[≺]_ _→_ ( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [).]


By Theorem 3.4 and (1), we have _r_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≥]_ _[r]_ [(] _[mK]_ [2] _[, K][s,t]_ [) = max] _[{][m]_ [ +] _[ s]_ [ +] _[ t][ −]_ [1] _[,]_ [ 2] _[m]_ [ +]

_s −_ 1 _}_ . For _t ≥_ _m_, we have _|V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ _m_ + _s_ + _t −_ 1. By Fact 2, we have




        - _m −_ 1
_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ _st_ + _s_ ( _m −_ 1) _−_
2




- - _m −_ 1
= _s_ ( _t_ + _m −_ 1) _−_
2




_._



For _m ≥_ _t_, we have _|V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ 2 _m_ + _s −_ 1. Similarly, by Fact 2, we have




          - _m −_ 1
_|E_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ) _| ≥_ _st_ + _s_ (2 _m −_ _t −_ 1) _−_
2




- - _m −_ 1
= _s_ (2 _m −_ 1) _−_

_._



Note that ˆ _r_ ( _mK_ 2 _, K_ 1 _,t_ ) = _mt_ and ˆ _r_ ( _mK_ 2 _, C_ 4) = 4 _m_ in [17]. By Proposition 3.2, we have

_r_ ˆedge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ 1 _[≺]_ _,t_ [) =] _[ mt]_ [ and ˆ] _[r]_ [edge][(] _[mK]_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ 2 _[≺]_ _,_ 2 [) = 4] _[m]_ [. This implies that the upper bound of Theorem]

3.5 is sharp. In particular, ˆ _r_ edge( _mK_ 2 _[≺][, K]_ 1 _[≺]_ _,_ 2 [) = 2] _[m]_ [. Thus, the bounds established in Theorem][ 3.5]

are sharp.

#### **3.3 Complete bipartite graphs**


Let _K_ 1 _,n_ be a star graph with center vertex _v_ and leaf vertices _v_ 1 _, v_ 2 _, . . ., vn_ . We define the

edge-ordered star graph _K_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ [by equipping] _[ K]_ [1] _[,n]_ [with the edge order. This total order on the edge]

set _E_ ( _K_ 1 _,n_ ) is specified such that ( _v, v_ 1) _≺_ ( _v, v_ 2) _≺· · · ≺_ ( _v, vn_ ) _._

The neighborhood _NG≺_ ( _v_ ) of a vertex _v ∈_ _V_ ( _G_ ) is contained in _V_ ( _G_ _[≺]_ ), and _dG≺_ ( _v_ ) = _|NG≺_ ( _v_ ) _|_ .

Similarly, _NG_ _[R][≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [) and] _[ N]_ _G_ _[ B][≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [) are the red and blue neighborhoods of] _[ v][ ∈]_ _[V]_ [ (] _[G][≺]_ [), respectively, and]

_d_ _[R]_ _G_ _[≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [) =] _[ |][N]_ _G_ _[ R][≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [)] _[|]_ [ and] _[ d][B]_ _G_ _[≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [) =] _[ |][N]_ _G_ _[ B][≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [)] _[|]_ [.]


**Theorem 3.6.** _For any positive integers n, s, t, we have_


_r_ ˆ _edge_ ( _K_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ _[, K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[s]_ [2][(] _[n][ −]_ [1) +] _[ st.]_


_Moreover, the upper bound is sharp._


17


_Proof._ Let _F_ _[≺]_ be an edge-ordered complete bipartite graph with partition classes _A_ and _B_, where


_|A|_ = _s_ and _|B|_ = _s_ ( _n −_ 1) + _t_, and let the vertices in _A_ be denoted by _{v_ 1 _, . . ., vs}_ . Assume that

there is no red edge-ordered _K_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ [for any red/blue edge-coloring of] _[ F][ ≺]_ [, we will show that there is]

a blue edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [. Since there is no red edge-ordered] _[ K]_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ [, it follows that] _[ d][R]_ _F_ _[≺]_ [(] _[v][i]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[n][ −]_ [1]

for each 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _s_ . Then _d_ _[B]_ _F_ _[≺]_ [(] _[v][i]_ [)] _[ ≥|][B][| −]_ [(] _[n][ −]_ [1) for each 1] _[ ≤]_ _[i][ ≤]_ _[s]_ [. Furthermore, we have]


_|NF_ _[B][≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [1][)] _[ ∩]_ _[N]_ _F_ _[ B][≺]_ [(] _[v]_ [2][)] _[ ∩]_ _[. . .][ ∩]_ _[N]_ _F_ _[ B][≺]_ [(] _[v][s]_ [)] _[| ≥|][B][| −]_ _[s]_ [(] _[n][ −]_ [1) =] _[ t.]_


These common neighbors form a blue edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [with] _[ {][v]_ [1] _[, . . ., v][s][}]_ [. Since] _[ K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [is a subgraph]

of _F_ _[≺]_, its edge order is necessarily preserved. This implies that we obtain the desired blue edge
ordered copy of _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [.]


For positive integers _n_ and _t_, we have ˆ _r_ ( _K_ 1 _,n, K_ 1 _,t_ ) = _n_ + _t −_ 1, a result established in [16].

By Theorem 3.6 and (2), we have ˆ _r_ edge( _K_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ _[, K]_ 1 _[≺]_ _,t_ [) =] _[ n]_ [ +] _[ t][ −]_ [1. Faudree et al. [][19][] proved that]

_r_ ˆ( _K_ 1 _,n, K_ 2 _,t_ ) = 4 _n_ +2 _t_ _−_ 4 for _t ≥_ 9 and _n_ is sufficiently large, and also showed that ˆ _r_ ( _K_ 1 _,n, K_ 2 _,_ 2) =

4 _n_ for _n ≥_ 3. Similarly, by Theorem 3.6 and (2), we have ˆ _r_ edge( _K_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ _[, K]_ 2 _[≺]_ _,t_ [) = 4] _[n]_ [ + 2] _[t][ −]_ [4 for] _[ t][ ≥]_ [9]

and _n_ is sufficiently large, and ˆ _r_ edge( _K_ 1 _[≺]_ _,n_ _[, K]_ 2 _[≺]_ _,_ 2 [) = 4] _[n]_ [ for] _[ n][ ≥]_ [3.]


**Theorem 3.7.** _For any integers t ≥_ _s ≥_ 2 _, we have_ ˆ _redge_ ( _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ _[es]_ [2][2] _[s]_ [+2] _[t][.]_


_Proof._ Let _F_ _[≺]_ be a edge-ordered complete bipartite graph with partition classes _A_ and _B_, where

_|A|_ = 2 _s_ [2] and _|B|_ = _e_ 2 _[s]_ [+1] _t_ . Then _|E_ ( _F_ _[≺]_ ) _|_ = _es_ [2] 2 _[s]_ [+2] _t_ . It suffices to show that any red/blue

coloring of _F_ _[≺]_ contains either a red edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [or a blue edge-ordered] _[ K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [. We begin by]

splitting the vertex set _B_ into two disjoint subsets. A vertex _v ∈_ _B_ is designated _red_ whenever at


least half of its incident edges are red, and designated _blue_ in all other instances.


Since _|B|_ = _e_ 2 _[s]_ [+1] _t_, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one class (red or blue) contains at least


_e_ 2 _[s]_ _t_ vertices. Without loss of generality, assume that there are at least _e_ 2 _[s]_ _t_ red vertices, denote

these vertices by _B_ 1. Each vertex _v ∈_ _B_ 1 has degree 2 _s_ [2] in _A_ . By the definition of a red vertex,

at least _s_ [2] of the edges incident to _v_ are red. It follows that every vertex _v_ gives rise to at least

- _ss_ 2� distinct red stars _K_ 1 _[≺]_ _,s_ [. The total number of red stars is at least]

There are �2 _s_ 2� subsets of size _s_ (leaf sets) in _A_ . Each red star corresponds to a leaf set. Thus,

for _s ≥_ 2, the average number of occurrences per leaf set is at least

and _s ≥_ 2. Therefore, there exists a leaf set (an _s_ -subset of _A_ ) that appears in at least _t_ red stars.

The centers of these stars (from _B_ ) and the leaf set form a red _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [. Since] _[ K]_ _s,t_ _[≺]_ [is a subgraph of]

_F_ _[≺]_, it follows that its edge order is still preserved, that is, we have a red edge-ordered _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [, as]


desired.


Pikhurko [29] proved that ˆ _r_ ( _Ks,t_ ) = Θ� _s_ [2] 2 _[s]_ _t_  - for fixed _s_ and sufficiently large _t_ . Therefore, by


Theorem 3.7 and (2), we have the following corollary:


**Corollary 3.8.** ˆ _redge_ ( _Ks,t_ _[≺]_ [) = Θ] - _s_ [2] 2 _[s]_ _t_ - _for fixed s and sufficiently large t._
