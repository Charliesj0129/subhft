# The Physics of Price Discovery: Deconvolving Information, Volatility, and the Critical Breakdown of Signal during Retail Herding

#### Sungwoo Kang [∗] Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Korea University Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea January 21, 2026

**Abstract**


Building on the finding that Market Cap Normalization ( _S_ MC) isolates the “pure”


directional signal of informed trading (Kang, 2025), this paper investigates the physics


of how that signal is transmitted—and how it breaks down. We employ **Tikhonov-**


**regularized deconvolution** to recover the impulse response kernels of investor flows,


revealing a dual-channel market structure: Foreign and Institutional investors act as “ar

chitects” of price discovery (positive permanent impact), while Individual investors act


as liquidity providers (negative total impact). However, using **Multivariate Hawkes**


**Processes**, we demonstrate that this structure is fragile. We find that individual in

vestor order flow exhibits near-critical self-excitation (Branching Ratio _≈_ 0.998). Dur

ing periods of high retail herding, the market undergoes a **phase transition** into a


“critical state.” In this regime, the signal-to-noise ratio collapses, causing the price

impact of sophisticated investors to reverse from positive to negative. These findings


suggest that retail contagion acts as a physical barrier that temporarily disables efficient


price discovery.

### **1 Introduction**

The central tenet of market microstructure theory is the distinction between “informed”


trading, which facilitates permanent price discovery, and “uninformed” or noise trading,


which generates transient volatility. Since Kyle (1985), researchers have sought to decouple


these forces by analyzing the relationship between order flow imbalance and asset returns.


However, a critical methodological ambiguity remains: how should order flow be normalized


to extract the purest informational signal?


Standard practice typically employs volume normalization ( _S_ TV), effectively measuring


the execution cost relative to current liquidity. However, this conflates information arrival


with volatility. In Kang (2025), we established that Market Cap Normalization ( _S_ MC) is the


superior metric for isolating the static “pure” information signal from liquidity noise. Building


on that foundation, this paper shifts focus from the _measurement_ of signal to the _physics_


of its transmission. We investigate the dynamic mechanics of price discovery, specifically


modeling how the “Phase Transition” into a “Critical State” of retail herding—quantified via


“Hawkes Processes”—can disrupt the standard impulse response functions recovered through


“Deconvolution.”


We approach this problem through two advanced physical modeling frameworks. First,


we employ **Tikhonov-regularized deconvolution** to extract the “Impulse Response Func

tions” of investor flows. This allows us to visualize the temporal shape of liquidity: whether


a unit of flow creates a permanent step-function in price (characteristic of fundamental infor

mation) or a transient spike-and-decay pattern (characteristic of noise). Second, we model


the systemic stability of these flows using **Multivariate Hawkes Processes**, treating large


trading surges as self-exciting point processes. This allows us to quantify the “criticality” of


the market—specifically, whether trading activity is exogenous (news-driven) or endogenous


(feedback-driven).


Our analysis yields three distinct contributions to the physics of price discovery.


First, using information-theoretic measures, we resolve the debate between volume and


3


market-cap normalization. We show that while volume-normalized flows ( _S_ TV) appear to


have high distributional divergence, this is largely an artifact of volatility clustering. Once


returns are standardized by their rolling volatility, the informational content of institutional


_S_ MC flows is shown to be **4.85 times greater** than that of _S_ TV flows (representing a 14-fold


improvement over the unadjusted baseline). This confirms that _S_ MC isolates the directional


“signal,” while _S_ TV largely captures the volatility “noise.”


Second, our deconvolution analysis reveals a stark physical segmentation of market par

ticipants. We identify a “Global Market Kernel” where Foreign and Institutional flows exert a


positive, persistent price impact, acting as the architects of price discovery. Conversely, Indi

vidual investor flows exhibit a **negative cumulative impact**, effectively acting as liquidity


providers whose buying pressure systematically precedes mean reversion.


Third, and perhaps most significantly, we document a **regime-dependent breakdown**


in market efficiency. We find that individual investor order flow exhibits a Hawkes Branching


Ratio of _≈_ 0.998, indicating a system in a near-critical state of self-excitation. During periods


of high retail herding, the standard laws of price impact are suspended. We show that


the price impact of sophisticated institutional investors, typically positive and permanent,


**reverses to negative** during these high-herding regimes. This suggests that “swarming”


behavior by noise traders creates a noise barrier so dense that it temporarily inverts the


signal-to-noise ratio, rendering sophisticated flow toxic.


Collectively, these findings suggest that price discovery is not a constant mechanical


property of the market, but a state variable dependent on the “temperature” of retail herding.


When the crowd is quiet, the signal ( _S_ MC) transmits clearly; when the crowd herds, the


physics of information transmission breaks down.


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical


framework and related literature. Section 3 describes our data and empirical methodology.


Section 4 presents our main results across the three experiments. Section 5 discusses the


implications and Section 6 concludes.

### **2 Theoretical Framework and Literature Review**

#### **2.1 Market Microstructure Theory**

The foundation of market microstructure theory lies in distinguishing between informed


and uninformed trading. Kyle (1985) developed the seminal continuous-time trading model


where informed traders possess private information about an asset’s fundamental value, while


noise traders generate non-informational order flow. This framework predicts that informed


trading should have permanent price impact, while noise trading generates only transient


volatility.


The empirical challenge is measuring this distinction. Traditional approaches normalize


order flow by trading volume to construct imbalance metrics. However, as Hasbrouck (1991)


and Hasbrouck (1993) demonstrate, volume itself is endogenous and varies with information


arrival. This creates a confound: high volume-normalized imbalance may indicate informed


trading or simply reflect low liquidity conditions.


We build on recent work proposing market capitalization as an alternative normalization


(Kang, 2025). The intuition is that market cap represents the fundamental “scale” of a


security, independent of transient liquidity conditions. A $1 million buy order in a $100


million market cap stock represents the same fundamental signal as a $10 million buy in


a $1 billion stock, but volume-based normalization would treat these differently if liquidity


varies.

#### **2.2 Information Geometry and KL Divergence**


To quantify the informational content of different normalization schemes, we employ tools


from information geometry. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback and Leibler,


1951) measures the separation between two probability distributions. For return distribu

tions conditional on buying ( _P_ buy) versus selling ( _P_ sell), the KL divergence quantifies how


5


distinguishable the two regimes are:


                 _DKL_ ( _P_ buy _∥P_ sell) = _P_ buy( _r_ ) log _[P]_ [buy][(] _[r]_ [)] (1)

_P_ sell( _r_ ) _[dr]_


A key insight is that return distributions exhibit fat tails (Mandelbrot, 1963), requiring


Student- _t_ distributions for accurate characterization. Moreover, volatility clustering (Engle,


1982) creates artifacts: high _S_ TV periods may simply coincide with high volatility regimes,


inflating apparent distributional separation without genuine informational content.


We address this by standardizing returns using rolling volatility:


_R_ adj _,t_ +1 = _[R][t,t]_ [+1] (2)

_σt,_ rolling


where _σt,_ rolling is the 20-day rolling standard deviation. This volatility adjustment isolates


the directional signal from the volatility artifact.

#### **2.3 Impulse Response and Deconvolution**


The price impact literature typically estimates contemporaneous or short-lag effects (Evans


and Lyons, 2002). However, the full temporal structure of impact—the “impulse response


function”—provides richer physical insight. Consider the discrete-time convolution model:



_Rt_ + _k_ =



_L_


_ψτ · It_ + _k−τ_ + _εt_ + _k_ (3)

_τ_ =0



where _Rt_ + _k_ is the return at lag _k_, _It_ is the order flow imbalance, _ψτ_ is the impulse response


kernel, and _L_ is the maximum lag.


Recovering _ψτ_ from observed ( _It, Rt_ ) pairs is a deconvolution problem. This is notoriously


ill-posed due to noise amplification (Hansen, 1998). We employ Tikhonov regularization:


min (4)
_ψ_ _[∥]_ **[R]** _[ −]_ **[I]** _[ψ][∥]_ [2][ +] _[ λ][∥][ψ][∥]_ [2]


6


where _λ_ is the regularization parameter balancing fit and smoothness. The kernel _ψ_ reveals


whether impact is:


  - **Permanent** : _ψτ >_ 0 for all _τ_, cumulative impact positive (informative trading)


  - **Transient** : _ψτ_ oscillates, cumulative impact near zero (liquidity provision)


  - **Reverting** : _ψ_ 0 _>_ 0 but [�] _ψτ <_ 0 (noise trading/overreaction)

#### **2.4 Self-Exciting Processes and Market Herding**


Trading activity often exhibits clustering beyond what exogenous news arrival would predict


(Sornette, 2003). Hawkes processes (Hawkes, 1971) model this via self-excitation. For a


univariate Hawkes process, the intensity function is:


       _λ_ ( _t_ ) = _µ_ + _αe_ _[−][β]_ [(] _[t][−][t][i]_ [)] (5)


_ti<t_


where _µ_ is the baseline rate, _α_ measures the magnitude of self-excitation, and _β_ is the decay


rate. The **branching ratio** _n_ = _α/β_ determines criticality (Reynaud-Bouret and Roy,


2013):


  - _n <_ 1: Subcritical (stable, exogenous-driven)


  - _n ≈_ 1: Critical (endogenous feedback, avalanches possible)


  - _n >_ 1: Supercritical (explosive, unrealistic for markets)


When the branching ratio approaches unity, the market enters a “critical state” where


endogenous feedback dominates. We hypothesize that during such periods, the standard


information transmission mechanism breaks down: even informed flow becomes noise-like as


the system is overwhelmed by self-reinforcing herding dynamics.


7


### **3 Data and Methodology**

#### **3.1 Data Description**

We analyze order flow and return data from the Korean Stock Exchange (KOSPI) over the


period 2020–2024. Korea provides an ideal laboratory for several reasons: (1) comprehensive


investor classification data separating Foreign, Institutional, and Individual investors; (2) liq

uid, developed market with substantial institutional participation; and (3) well-documented


episodes of retail trading surges.


Our sample consists of approximately 2,500 actively traded stocks with daily order flow


imbalance data. The order flow data record net buying (purchases minus sales) by investor


category, measured in Korean won. We focus on daily frequency to avoid microstructure


noise while capturing short-to-medium term price impact dynamics.


Returns are calculated as close-to-close log returns: _Rt,t_ +1 = log( _Pt_ +1 _/Pt_ ). We exclude


penny stocks (price _<_ 1,000 KRW) and apply standard filters to remove outliers (winsorize


returns at 0.5% tails).

#### **3.2 Normalization Methods**


We compare two normalization schemes for order flow imbalance:


**Market Cap Normalization:**


_S_ MC _,t_ = [Buy] _[t][ −]_ [Sell] _[t]_ (6)

MarketCap _t_


where MarketCap _t_ = _Pt×_ SharesOutstanding. This measures the fundamental “force” relative


to firm size.


**Volume Normalization:**

_S_ TV _,t_ = [Buy] _[t][ −]_ [Sell] _[t]_ (7)

TotalVolume _t_


where TotalVolume _t_ is the total traded value. This measures the directional component of


8


liquidity provision.


For volatility adjustment, we compute 20-day rolling standard deviation:



20


( _Rt−k −_ _R_ [¯] _t_ ) [2] (8)

_k_ =1



_σt,_ roll =




~~�~~

~~�~~


- [1]

20



with minimum 10 days of data required. Adjusted returns are then _R_ adj _,t_ +1 = _Rt,t_ +1 _/σt,_ roll.

#### **3.3 Statistical Methods**


**3.3.1** **KL Divergence Estimation**


For each investor type and normalization scheme, we partition observations into top and


bottom deciles based on order flow imbalance. We fit Student- _t_ distributions to the return


distributions in each regime using maximum likelihood estimation:




- _−_ ( _ν_ +1) _/_ 2
(9)



_f_ ( _r_ ; _ν, µ, σ_ ) = [Γ((] _[ν]_ [ + 1)] _[/]_ [2)]

Γ( _ν/_ 2) _σ_ ~~_[√]_~~ ~~_νπ_~~



�1 + [(] _[r][ −]_ _[µ]_ [)][2]

_νσ_ [2]



where _ν_ is degrees of freedom, _µ_ is location, and _σ_ is scale.


The KL divergence is estimated via Monte Carlo integration using fitted parameters. We


report both _DKL_ ( _P_ buy _∥P_ sell) and its reverse, using the symmetric Jensen-Shannon divergence


for robustness checks.


**3.3.2** **Tikhonov-Regularized Deconvolution**


We implement stock-level deconvolution for each investor type. For stock _i_, we construct the


design matrix **I** _i_ from lagged order flow and response vector **R** _i_ from future returns (lags 0


to 60 days). The regularized solution is:


ˆ
_ψi_ = ( **I** _[T]_ _i_ **[I]** _[i]_ [+] _[ λ]_ **[I]** [)] _[−]_ [1] **[I]** _[T]_ _i_ **[R]** _[i]_ (10)


9


with _λ_ = 5 _._ 0 chosen via cross-validation to balance fit and smoothness.


For the global kernel (Experiment B), we employ subsampled pooled deconvolution: ran

domly sample 100 stocks, pool their ( _I, R_ ) pairs into a single large design matrix, solve the


regularized problem, and repeat 5 times with different random seeds. The final kernel is the


mean across iterations.


Key kernel statistics:


  - **Half-life** : Number of days for cumulative impact to reach 50% of total


  - **Total impact** : [�] _τ_ [60] =0 _[ψ][τ]_


  - **Contemporaneous impact** : _ψ_ 0


**3.3.3** **Hawkes Process Estimation**


We model individual investor trading surges as a univariate Hawkes process. An event (surge)


is defined as a day where absolute imbalance exceeds 1.5 standard deviations. We estimate


parameters ( _µ, α, β_ ) via maximum likelihood:



_T_ 
_λ_ ( _s_ ) _ds_ (11)
0



_L_ =



_N_





    -     - _T_


_λ_ ( _ti_ ) _·_ exp _−_

0

_i_ =1



The branching ratio is _n_ = _α/β_ . The average intensity is computed as:


_µ_
¯
_λ_ = (12)
1 _−_ _n_


provided _n <_ 1.


**3.3.4** **Regime Classification**


We classify market days into “high herding” and “normal” regimes based on Hawkes intensity.


For each trading day _t_ in our sample period, we compute _λt_ using the estimated Hawkes


10


parameters and observed event history up to _t_ . Days where _λt_ exceeds the 90th percentile


of the intensity distribution are classified as high herding; the remaining 90% are normal.


We then run deconvolution separately for each regime, partitioning the ( _I, R_ ) data by


regime classification. This yields regime-conditional impulse response functions.

### **4 Results**

#### **4.1 The Shape of Liquidity: Global Impulse Response**


We begin by establishing the fundamental physical characteristics of different investor types


through their impulse response kernels. Figure 1 presents the global market kernel for each


investor class, obtained via subsampled pooled deconvolution.


Table 1 summarizes the key kernel characteristics. The results are striking: Foreign and


Institutional investors exhibit positive total impact, with Foreign flows showing particularly


strong persistent effects (+0.0056). Both groups have zero half-life, indicating impact is


primarily contemporaneous but remains positive over the 60-day horizon.


Table 1: Global Kernel Summary Statistics


Investor Type Half-Life (days) Total Impact Contemporaneous Impact



Foreign 0 0.0056 0.0044
Institutional 0 0.0024 0.0062
Individual 0 –0.0045 –0.0060



_Note:_ Global



kernels estimated via subsampled pooled deconvolution (5 iterations, 100 stocks per iteration).
Half-life is the number of days to reach 50% of total cumulative impact. Total impact is the sum
of the kernel over 60 days. Contemporaneous impact is the lag-0 coefficient.


In stark contrast, Individual investors exhibit _negative_ total impact (–0.0045). This is


consistent with noise trading or overreaction: when retail investors buy aggressively, prices


initially move up (positive contemporaneous impact), but subsequently reverse as informed


investors fade the noise. The negative cumulative impact indicates retail flows systematically


mark local price maxima.


11


Figure 1: **Global Market Impulse Response by Investor Type.** This figure illustrates
the “Global Market Kernel” derived via pooled Tikhonov-regularized deconvolution (100
subsampled stocks, 5 iterations). The y-axis represents the cumulative price impact (log
returns) of a unit shock in Market Cap-normalized order flow ( _S_ MC) over a 60-day lag window.
**Foreign** (panel A) and **Institutional** (panel B) investors exhibit positive, persistent impact
(+0.0056 and +0.0024 respectively), confirming their role as informed traders contributing
to fundamental price discovery. **Individual** investors (panel C) exhibit negative cumulative
impact (-0.0045), indicating that retail buying pressure typically precedes price reversion.
These distinct kernel shapes validate the physical segmentation of the market: sophisticated
agents drive value, while retail agents provide liquidity (noise), with their buying peaks
marking local maxima before reversion.


12


This establishes the “dual-channel” market structure: sophisticated investors (Foreign


and Institutional) act as architects of price discovery, embedding fundamental information


into prices. Individual investors act as liquidity providers, their order flow effectively serving


as a contrarian signal for sophisticated traders.

#### **4.2 Robustness Check: Information Geometry and the Volatility** **Artifact**


While Kang (2025) established the superiority of _S_ MC via regression analysis, we provide a


brief information-theoretic validation to confirm this choice is robust to volatility clustering.


Figure 2 compares the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of return distributions conditional


on order flow.


The results in Table 2 confirm our premise. While _S_ TV appears superior on raw returns,


this is largely an artifact of volatility clustering.


Table 2: KL Divergence Analysis: Volatility Adjustment Effect


Original (Raw Returns) Volatility-Adjusted Returns


Investor KL _S_ MC KL _S_ TV Ratio KL _S_ MC KL _S_ TV Ratio



Foreign 0.00402 0.01127 0.36 0.00304 0.00837 0.36
**Institutional** **0.00019** **0.00054** **0.35** **0.00046** **0.00009** **4.85**
Individual 0.00308 0.00266 1.15 0.00148 0.00213 0.69



_Note:_ KL



divergence computed between top and bottom deciles of order flow imbalance. Ratio =
KL _S_ MC/KL _S_ TV. Ratio _>_ 1 indicates _S_ MC provides better distributional separation. Volatility
adjustment uses 20-day rolling standard deviation: _R_ adj = _Rt,t_ +1 _/σt,_ rolling. **Bold** highlights the
dramatic 14-fold improvement for Institutional investors after adjustment.


Once returns are standardized by rolling volatility, the informational content of Institu

tional _S_ MC flows dominates, showing a **4.85** _×_ improvement over _S_ TV. This 14-fold reversal


confirms that _S_ MC isolates the true directional signal, distinguishing it from the volatility


noise captured by _S_ TV. This justifies our use of _S_ MC as the primary input for the physical


models in the subsequent sections.


13


Figure 2: **KL Divergence Ratios: The Effect of Volatility Adjustment.** This chart
compares the informational content of Market Cap Normalization ( _S_ MC) versus Volume
Normalization ( _S_ TV) by displaying the ratio of their KL Divergences (KL _S_ MC/KL _S_ TV). A ratio

_>_ 1 indicates _S_ MC provides better separation between “Buy” and “Sell” return distributions.
**Left bars (Raw Returns):** _S_ TV appears superior for Institutional investors (Ratio 0.35 _×_ ),
suggesting volume-normalized flows better capture raw variance. **Right bars (Volatility-**
**Standardized):** After standardizing returns by 20-day rolling volatility ( _R_ adj = _R/σ_ 20 _d_ ),
the Institutional ratio jumps to 4.85 _×_ (a 14-fold improvement). This confirms that _S_ TV
primarily predicts volatility regimes, whereas _S_ MC isolates the true directional information of
the trade. Once the “noise” of volatility is removed, _S_ MC is the superior carrier of fundamental
signal.


14


#### **4.3 The Critical Breakdown: Regime-Dependent Impact**

Our final experiment reveals the most striking finding: the breakdown of standard price


impact relationships during retail herding episodes. We first establish that individual investor


order flow exhibits near-critical self-excitation.


Table 3 presents the estimated Hawkes parameters. The branching ratio is 0.998, indicat

ing the process is at the boundary of criticality. A branching ratio this close to unity implies


that each trading surge generates, on average, 0.998 subsequent surges, creating long-lasting


avalanche-like dynamics. The system teeters on the edge of explosive feedback.


Table 3: Hawkes Process Parameters and Regime Classification


Parameter _µ_ _α_ _β_ BR ( _α/β_ ) Half-Life (days) Empirical Rate ( _N/T_ )


Estimate 0.0149 0.02460 0.02464 **0.998** 28.1 0.100


_Regime Classification (90th percentile threshold):_
High Herding Days: 126 (10.0%) Normal Days: 1,133 (90.0%)
Intensity Threshold: 0.200 Total Events: 126

_Note:_ Hawkes parameters estimated via maximum likelihood on individual investor surge events


(defined as days with _|_ imbalance _| >_ 1 _._ 5 _σ_ ). Branching ratio (BR) _≈_ 1 indicates near-critical
self-excitation. Empirical Rate = _N/T_ = 126 _/_ 1259 = 0 _._ 100. Note that for near-critical processes
(BR _≈_ 0.998), the theoretical asymptotic intensity _λ_ [¯] = _µ/_ (1 _−_ _n_ ) _≈_ 7 _._ 45 assumes stationarity,
which is not reached for near-critical processes over finite horizons; the empirical rate correctly
characterizes the transient system dynamics.


Using the 90th percentile of Hawkes intensity as the threshold, we classify 126 days (10%


of the sample) as high herding periods. During these days, the market exhibits endogenous


feedback—trading activity begets more trading activity in a self-reinforcing loop.


A subtle but important point concerns the interpretation of average intensity for near

critical Hawkes processes. The standard asymptotic formula _λ_ [¯] = _µ/_ (1 _−_ _n_ ) would yield 7.45


events/day given our parameters, far exceeding the observed rate of 0.100 events/day. This


is not an estimation error but reflects transient dynamics: with _n ≈_ 0 _._ 998, the equilibration


timescale is extremely long, and our sample provides only a few equilibration periods. The


asymptotic formula describes a counterfactual infinite-time limit that the finite sample has


not yet reached. The empirical rate correctly characterizes the system’s observed behavior.


15


Figure 3 shows the regime-conditional impulse response functions. The contrast is stark.


During normal periods (blue lines), Foreign and Institutional investors exhibit the expected


positive, persistent impact. But during high herding periods (red lines), their impact col

lapses and _turns negative_ .











Figure 3: **The Breakdown of Signal During Retail Herding.** This figure demonstrates the “Regime Flip” in price efficiency conditional on retail market structure. **Panel**
**A (Hawkes Intensity):** Classifies market days into “Normal” (90%) and “High Herding”
(10%) regimes based on the self-excitation intensity of individual investors (Branching Ratio
= 0.998). **Panel B (Conditional Kernels):** Shows the cumulative price impact of Institutional flows in both regimes. In “Normal” conditions (blue line), impact is positive and
persistent (+0.0047). In “High Herding” conditions (red line), impact collapses and becomes
deeply negative (–0.0447). This provides evidence of a phase transition in market efficiency.
When retail herding reaches critical levels, the “noise” overwhelms the “signal,” causing even
sophisticated institutional flows to lose their predictive power and resulting in market inefficiency.


Table 4 quantifies this regime flip. For Institutional investors, the total impact ratio


(herding/normal) is **–9.44** _×_ . That is, their normally positive impact (+0.0047) reverses to


strongly negative (–0.0447) during herding episodes. Foreign investors show a similar but


less extreme pattern (ratio –1.80 _×_ ). Even Individual investors, normally mean-reverting,


show positive impact during herding (ratio –0.77 _×_ ).


The physical interpretation is profound: when the market enters a critical state driven by

(weight proportional to observations/liquidity). The "Time-Weighted Avg" in Panel B reconciles

positive impact is driven by large-cap stocks, while the typical stock (Panel A) experiences
negative impact during herding.


retail self-excitation, the normal rules of information transmission break down. The “noise”


(retail herding) becomes so dense that it creates a barrier to information flow. Sophisticated


investors, attempting to trade on fundamental signals during these periods, find their trades


embedded in noise rather than contributing to price discovery. The market temporarily


becomes informationally opaque.


Additionally, note that half-lives extend during herding for all investor types. This sug

gests impact persists longer when the market is in a critical state, consistent with reduced


efficiency and slower price adjustment.

### **5 Discussion**

#### **5.1 The Dual-Channel Market Structure**

Our results reveal a fundamental duality in how order flow information is encoded. _S_ MC


serves as the “true signal” channel, capturing directional information about fundamental


value. This is particularly evident for Institutional investors, where the 14-fold improvement


after volatility adjustment demonstrates that _S_ MC isolates pure information flow.


In contrast, _S_ TV operates primarily as a “volatility proxy” channel. While useful for mea

suring execution costs and temporary price impact, it confounds information with liquidity


conditions. A high _S_ TV period may indicate informed trading, or it may simply reflect a


low-liquidity regime where any trade moves prices.


**5.1.1** **Aggregation and Heterogeneity**


The divergence between our Global (Table 1) and Conditional (Table 4) results highlights an


important microstructure reality: price impact is highly heterogeneous across firm size. Ta

ble 1 and Panel B of Table 4 use _pooled_ aggregation, which implicitly weights observations


by data availability and market presence, effectively capturing the “market-cap weighted”


physics. Here, Institutional investors show a positive time-weighted impact (+0 _._ 0025), con

sistent with their role in efficient price discovery for large-cap stocks.


However, Panel A of Table 4 uses _by-stock_ aggregation (equal weighting), reflecting the


experience of the “typical” stock. The deeply negative impact during herding ( _−_ 0 _._ 0447)


suggests that for the average stock—likely smaller and less liquid—institutional order flow


becomes toxic when retail investors herd. Crucially, **both aggregation methods confirm**


**the same physical breakdown** : whether measured by the equal-weighted typical stock


(Panel A) or the liquidity-weighted market aggregate (Panel B), institutional price impact


significantly deteriorates during herding regimes, differing only in the degree of reversal.


This duality suggests that while the market _in aggregate_ remains somewhat efficient, the


18


_cross-section_ of stocks suffers a severe breakdown in price discovery during retail contagion


events.


For practitioners, this has direct implications:


  - **Alpha signal construction:** Factor models should incorporate _S_ MC-based flows after


volatility normalization, not raw _S_ TV flows.


  - **Risk management:** _S_ TV remains useful for cost modeling, but should not be inter

preted as an information signal for sophisticated investors.


  - **Market making:** Liquidity providers should adjust quotes based on _S_ MC flows from


institutional investors, as these carry genuine directional content.

#### **5.2 The Critical State of Retail Herding**


The near-critical branching ratio (0.998) for retail trading surges is a remarkable finding. In


the language of statistical physics, this places the market at a “critical point”—the boundary


between ordered and disordered phases. Systems near criticality exhibit several characteristic


features that we observe in our data:


**Avalanches:** A single event can trigger a cascade of subsequent events, leading to power

law distributed event sizes. This is consistent with documented “retail frenzies” in specific


stocks.


**Long-range correlations:** Near-critical systems exhibit correlations over long timescales.


The extended half-lives during herding periods (Table 4) support this.


**Phase transitions:** Small parameter changes can trigger qualitative shifts in system


behavior. Here, the phase transition is in the _information transmission mechanism_ itself.


When retail intensity crosses the critical threshold, the market transitions from an efficient


(signal-dominated) state to an inefficient (noise-dominated) state.


The regime flip in institutional impact (from +0.0047 to –0.0447) is the empirical sig

nature of this phase transition. During normal periods, institutional flows are embedded in


19


prices as they should be. During herding episodes, the same flows generate opposite effects—


price initially moves in the direction of the flow, but subsequently reverses, yielding negative


cumulative impact.


Why does this occur? The noise barrier hypothesis: when retail herding is intense, the


market becomes saturated with noise trades. Institutional orders, even if fundamentally


motivated, are “camouflaged” within the noise and cannot be distinguished by other market


participants. As the herding episode resolves, prices revert, causing the initial institutional

driven move to reverse. From an institutional perspective, their information was “trapped”


by the noise barrier.

#### **5.3 Practical Implications**


These findings have several actionable implications across market participants:


**For Institutional Traders:**


  - Monitor Hawkes intensity as a “warning light.” When intensity exceeds the 90th per

centile, defer non-urgent trades.


  - During high herding periods, expect negative convexity: aggressive buying/selling will


reverse, not persist.


  - Consider contrarian strategies during identified herding episodes, fading retail flow


rather than following fundamentals.


**For Regulators:**


  - Develop real-time monitoring of branching ratios for retail trading activity.


  - High branching ratios (approaching 1) may warrant circuit breakers or cooling-off pe

riods to prevent market breakdown.


  - Policy interventions targeting retail herding (e.g., restrictions on short-term specula

tion) may enhance market efficiency beyond their direct effects.


20


**For Researchers:**


  - Standard price impact regressions assuming constant coefficients are misspecified. Regime

conditional models are necessary.


  - Information-based trading models should incorporate endogenous noise fluctuations,


not treat noise as exogenous.


  - The link between microstructure (herding dynamics) and asset pricing (information


efficiency) deserves further theoretical development.

#### **5.4 Limitations and Future Research**


Several limitations warrant discussion. First, our analysis focuses on a single market (Korea).


While Korea offers excellent data on investor classification, generalization to other markets


requires verification. Markets with different institutional structures (e.g., more algorithmic


trading in the U.S.) may exhibit different herding dynamics.


Second, we analyze daily frequency data to avoid microstructure noise. However, intraday


dynamics may differ. High-frequency herding episodes (e.g., within-day flash crashes) could


exhibit even more extreme breakdowns in information transmission. Future work should


extend the regime-conditional deconvolution framework to intraday horizons.


Third, our regime classification treats herding as endogenously determined by past trad

ing activity (Hawkes model). However, some herding episodes may be triggered by exoge

nous news events (e.g., pandemic announcements). Distinguishing exogenous vs. endogenous


herding triggers would enrich the analysis.


Fourth, while we document the regime flip empirically, the precise micro-foundations re

main an open question. Agent-based models incorporating heterogeneous investors (informed


institutional, herding retail) could provide theoretical grounding. Does the breakdown occur


due to adverse selection (informed traders withdraw), inventory constraints (market makers


21


reduce quotes), or attention constraints (investors cannot process information during noise


saturation)?


Finally, the near-critical branching ratio (0.998) invites theoretical investigation. Is this


an equilibrium outcome or a regulatory byproduct? Do markets naturally evolve toward


criticality (as suggested by self-organized criticality literature (Bak et al., 1987)), or are they


pushed there by regulatory constraints on trading?

### **6 Conclusion**


This paper demonstrates that price discovery is not a mechanical process but a _state-_


_dependent phenomenon_ governed by the interplay of information and noise. We make three


contributions to understanding this physics.


First, we resolve the normalization debate through information geometry. Market Cap


Normalization ( _S_ MC) isolates the pure directional signal of order flow, particularly for insti

tutional investors where its informational content is 14 times greater than Volume Normal

ization ( _S_ TV) after controlling for volatility. _S_ TV primarily captures volatility regimes, not


information.


Second, we establish the physical roles of market participants through impulse response


analysis. Foreign and institutional investors act as architects of price discovery, exhibiting


positive, persistent impact. Individual investors act as liquidity providers with negative


cumulative impact, their buying pressure marking local price maxima.


Third, and most significantly, we document a critical breakdown in market efficiency dur

ing retail herding episodes. Using Hawkes process analysis, we show that individual trading


surges exhibit near-critical self-excitation (branching ratio 0.998). During high herding pe

riods, institutional price impact _reverses from positive to negative_ —a 9.44-fold flip. This


regime transition suggests the market enters an inefficient state where noise overwhelms


signal, temporarily disabling information transmission.


22


These findings reframe market efficiency as a state variable, not a structural constant.


When retail herding intensity is low, markets function efficiently: informed flows embed


information, and prices discover value. When herding crosses the critical threshold, markets


become informationally opaque: even sophisticated flows generate noise-like patterns, and


price discovery breaks down.


For practitioners, the message is clear: monitor the “temperature” of retail herding. For


theorists, the challenge is to develop models where efficiency is endogenous, determined by


the dynamic balance between information and noise rather than assumed _a priori_ . The


physics of price discovery is richer—and more fragile—than standard models acknowledge.
