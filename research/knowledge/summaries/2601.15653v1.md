**ABSTRACT**


Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) offers effective noise reduction across large spatial areas by distributing the
computational load of centralized control to multiple low-cost nodes.
Conventional DMCANC methods, however, typically assume synchronous communication and require frequent data exchange, resulting in high communication overhead. To enhance efficiency and
adaptability, this work proposes an asynchronous communication
strategy where each node executes a weight-constrained filtered-x
LMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm and independently requests communication only when its local noise reduction performance degrades.
Upon request, other nodes transmit the weight difference between
their local control filter and the center point in WCFxLMS, which
are then integrated to update both the control filter and the center point. This design enables nodes to operate asynchronously
while preserving cooperative behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous communication DMCANC
(ACDMCANC) system maintains effective noise reduction with
significantly reduced communication load, offering improved scalability for heterogeneous networks.

**1. INTRODUCTION**


Noise control has attracted increasing attention in recent years, as
prolonged exposure to excessive noise poses risks to both physical
and mental health. Among various approaches, active noise control
(ANC) is particularly effective for attenuating low-frequency noise
by generating an anti-noise signal with the same amplitude but opposite phase [1]. To cope with diverse noise types and dynamic acoustic environments, the filtered reference least mean squares (FxLMS)
algorithm has become one of the most widely adopted solutions in
ANC systems [2]. A wide range of FxLMS modifications have been
developed to mitigate challenges encountered in real-world implementations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. More recently, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have spurred the design of deep-learning-driven ANC
algorithms [8, 9, 10], which provide promising avenues for achieving greater robustness and adaptability in complex acoustic conditions [11, 12, 13, 14].
Multichannel active noise control (MCANC) systems, which
employ multiple secondary sources and error sensors, have attracted
considerable attention for their ability to achieve global noise reduction over large spatial regions. A commonly adopted approach is the

centralized strategy, in which a single processor handles all inputs
and outputs while updating the control filters. Although effective,
this method imposes a heavy computational burden, challenging
the processor’s capacity and significantly increasing implementation
costs [15]. In contrast, the decentralized strategy distributes the
computation across multiple low-cost controllers, thereby reducing the load on any individual processor. However, this approach
often suffers from instability issues arising from mutual acoustic
crosstalk effect [16]. To overcome these limitations, distributed
control strategies have been increasingly explored, which aim to
balance computational efficiency with system stability [17, 18].


The distributed multichannel ANC (DMCANC) system comprises multiple ANC nodes, each running a single-channel ANC algorithm while exchanging key information to achieve global noise
reduction. The diffusion FxLMS (DFxLMS) algorithm was developed to support such systems by employing topology-based combination rules for data fusion [19, 20]. However, DFxLMS essentially
performs spatial smoothing [21], which limits its effectiveness in
handling asymmetric acoustic paths. To address this issue, the augmented DFxLMS (ADFxLMS) algorithm was proposed [22], followed by a bidirectional communication strategy aimed at reducing
communication overhead [23]. More recently, the auto shrink step
size mixed gradient FxLMS (ASSS-MGDFxLMS) algorithm incorporated compensation filters to mitigate crosstalk and address communication latency [24]. Nevertheless, most existing approaches assume data exchange at every sampling point, overlooking hardware
limitations that prevent communication frequencies from matching
ANC system sampling rates. In practice, communication issues significantly affect performance, revealing a gap between theoretical
developments and real-world implementation [25].


Therefore, we propose an asynchronous communication DMCANC (ACDMCANC) system. In this framework, each ANC node
executes the weight-constrained FxLMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm

[26] to mitigate instability arising from acoustic crosstalk during
non-communication phases. Communication is triggered adaptively: a node requests information exchange only when its own
local noise reduction performance ceases to improve. In response,
the other nodes transmit the weight difference between their current
control filter and the corresponding center point in the WCFxLMS.
These differences are then combined through the mixed weight
difference (MWD) operation, which updates both the local control
filter and the center point. It is worth noting that each node makes
communication decisions independently, based solely on its local
performance. This autonomy leads to asynchronous communication, allowing nodes to continue running WCFxLMS seamlessly
without interruption. As a result, the proposed ACDMCANC system effectively reduces communication overhead while enhancing

adaptability to heterogeneous and time-varying network conditions.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2
briefly reviews the DMCANC system. Section 3 describes the algorithms that is applied to ACDMCANC system. In Section 4, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.


**2. DISTRIBUTED MCANC SYSTEM**


The MCANC system is widely employed to create large quiet
zones. Among its control strategies, centralized control offers superior noise reduction performance but imposes a heavy computational
burden on a single processor. In contrast, distributed control alleviates this burden by distributing computation across multiple nodes,
though it requires inter-node communication to achieve effective
noise reduction.
Suppose the MCANC system consists of one reference sensor,
_K_ secondary sources and _K_ error sensors. The reference sensor
captures the reference signal _x_ ( _n_ ) which is used to generate the _k_ th
control signal as


_yk_ ( _n_ ) = **w** _k_ [T][(] _[n]_ [)] **[x]** [(] _[n]_ [)] _[,]_ _k_ = 1 _,_ 2 _, ..., K,_ (1)


where **w** _k_ ( _n_ ) = [ _wk,_ 0( _n_ ) _wk,_ 1( _n_ ) _· · · wk,Lw_ _−_ 1( _n_ )] [T] and **x** ( _n_ ) =

[ _x_ ( _n_ ) _x_ ( _n −_ 1) _· · · x_ ( _n −_ _Lw_ + 1)] [T] denote the _k_ th control filter
and reference signal vectors with the length of _Lw_, and _n_ is the time
index. The control signal _yk_ ( _n_ ) is reproduced by the _k_ th secondary
source and propagates through the secondary path _smk_ ( _n_ ), generating the anti-noise that suppresses the disturbance signal _dm_ ( _n_ ).
Accordingly, the _m_ th error sensor measures the residual error as



where _µ_ denotes the step size, and **x** _[′]_ _km_ [(] _[n]_ [)][ represents the filtered]
reference signal vector given by


**x** _[′]_ _km_ [(] _[n]_ [) = ˆ] _[s]_ _mk_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _[ ∗]_ **[x]** [(] _[n]_ [)] _[,]_ (4)


and ˆ _smk_ ( _n_ ) represents the estimate of the secondary path _smk_ ( _n_ ).
The DMCANC system partitions this heavy computational load
into multiple ANC nodes. Each node typically consists of a single
controller, a secondary source, and an error sensor, as illustrated in
Fig. 1. To derive the DMCANC algorithm, we first define the local
gradient of the _k_ th node as


_**∇**_ _k_ ( _n_ ) = _µ_ **x** _[′]_ _kk_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _[e]_ _k_ [(] _[n]_ [) =] _[ µ]_ [[] **[x]** [(] _[n]_ [)] _[ ∗]_ _[s]_ [ˆ] _kk_ [(] _[n]_ [)]] _[ ·][ e]_ _k_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _[,]_ (5)


According to (4) and (5), the centralized update equation in (3) can
be rewritten as



_K_

**w** _k_ ( _n_ + 1) = **w** _k_ ( _n_ ) + _**∇**_ _k_ ( _n_ ) + - [ **x** ( _n_ ) _∗_ _s_ ˆ _mk_ ( _n_ )] _em_ ( _n_ ) _._


_m_ =1 _,m_ = _k_

(6)
By comparing the last term in (6) with the definition of the local
gradient in (5), it can be seen that the difference lies in the filtering process. Specifically, the local gradient is computed using the
node’s self-secondary path ˆ _smm_ ( _n_ ), whereas the centralized update
involves the cross-secondary paths ˆ _smk_ ( _n_ ) ( _m ̸_ = _k_ ).
To reconcile this mismatch, compensation filters _cmk_ ( _n_ ) are
introduced to approximate the difference between self and crosssecondary paths [24], expressed as


_s_ ˆ _mk_ ( _n_ ) = ˆ _smm_ ( _n_ ) _∗_ _cmk_ ( _n_ ) _,_ ( _m ̸_ = _k_ ) _._ (7)


In practice, there are _K_ ( _K −_ 1) compensation filters in total, which
can be pre-estimated through offline training before ANC operation.
Substituting (7) into (6), and recalling the definition of the local gradient in (5), the update equation becomes



_K_

**w** _k_ ( _n_ +1) = **w** _k_ ( _n_ )+ _**∇**_ _k_ ( _n_ )+ - _**∇**_ _m_ ( _n_ ) _∗_ _cmk_ ( _n_ ) _,_ (8)


_m_ =1 _,m_ = _k_



where _**∇**_ _m_ ( _n_ ) denotes the local gradient of node _m_, which is exchanged among nodes through inter-node communication. This formulation constitutes the mixed gradient FxLMS (MGDFxLMS) algorithm [24], which extends the conventional centralized MEFxLMS
to a distributed setting.


**3. ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION DMCANC**


Conventional DMCANC systems require each ANC node to communicate at every sampling instant, which is impractical in realworld applications due to excessive communication demands. To
address this limitation, we propose an asynchronous communication
DMCANC (ACDMCANC) system, where each ANC node communicates independently based on its local condition. This strategy not
only reduces the overall communication overhead but also enhances
the system’s flexibility and scalability.

the interference caused by the other nodes, resulting in crosstalk between nodes [26].


**3.1. Weight-constrained FxLMS**


Due to discontinuous communication, the update range of the control filter should be constrained to prevent instability caused by
crosstalk among nodes during non-communication phases. To
achieve this, the cost function of each node is modified as


_Jk_ = E[ _e_ [2] _k_ [(] _[n]_ [)] +] _[ α][||]_ **[w]** [�] _k_ _[−]_ **[w]** _k_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _[||]_ [2] _[,]_ (9)


where _α_ denotes the penalty factor, _| · |_ represents the 2-norm operator, and � **w** _k_ is the constrained center point. Following the corresponding update rule, the control filter is updated as


**w** _k_ ( _n_ + 1) = **w** _k_ ( _n_ ) + _µ_ **x** _[′]_ _kk_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _[e]_ _k_ [(] _[n]_ [) +] _[ µα]_ [(] **[w]** [�] _k_ _[−]_ **[w]** _k_ [(] _[n]_ [))] _[.]_ [ (10)]


Equation (10) defines the weight-constrained FxLMS (WCFxLMS)
algorithm [26], where the last term serves as a penalty that restricts
the maximum deviation of the adaptive filter from its center point.
Consequently, even in the presence of strong crosstalk impulses, the
control filter can only deviate within a bounded range, thereby preventing divergence.


**3.2. Asynchronous communication strategy**


Since the WCFxLMS algorithm limits the update range of the control filters, it effectively prevents divergence caused by inter-node
crosstalk during the non-communication phase. However, this constraint inevitably reduces the maximum achievable noise reduction
performance. To overcome this limitation, a suitable communication strategy is required so that global information can be periodically integrated, thereby enhancing overall system performance. To
reduce the communication burden, the proposed system adopts an
asynchronous communication strategy, in which each node independently determines whether to request communication. The decision
is based on the residual noise level (RNL), defined for the _k_ th node
as
_ηk_ ( _n_ ) = 10 log10         - _e_ [2] _k_ [(] _[n]_ [)]         - _._ (11)


Due to the slow convergence of the LMS algorithm, an instantaneous
evaluation may not adequately reflect performance. Hence, an updating period _T_ is introduced, over which the average RNL (ANRL)



where _f_ denotes the sampling frequency. If the current ARNL is
worse than its previously recorded value, the node initiates a communication request.
Upon receiving the request, the other nodes transmit their weight
difference, defined as the deviation between the updated local control filter and the center point:


_**ϕk**_ ( _n_ ) = **w** _k_ ( _n_ + 1) _−_ **w**       - _k._ (13)


This weight difference _**ϕ**_ _k_ ( _n_ ) implicitly accumulates the effect of
multiple local gradient updates and thus acts as a compact representation of the local adaptation history. Inspired by the MGDFxLMS
algorithm expressed in (8), we extend the combination rule by replacing the local gradient _**∇**_ _k_ ( _n_ ) with _**ϕ**_ _k_ ( _n_ ), leading to the mixed
weight difference (MWD) update:



This new control filter � **w** _k,new_ will then update both local control
filter **w** _k_ ( _n_ ) and center point � **w** _k_ in the WCFxLMS for further iteration.
The block diagram of the proposed ACDMCANC system is
shown in Fig. 2. During non-communication phases, each node
updates its control filter using the WCFxLMS algorithm, thereby
maintaining a certain degree of local noise reduction and preventing
instability. When communication is triggered, the exchanged weight
differences from other nodes are fused through the MWD operation,
enabling the system to improve overall performance. By allowing nodes to communicate only when necessary and ensuring that
non-communicating nodes remain adaptive, the proposed ACDMCANC system significantly reduces communication overhead while
improving adaptability to heterogeneous network conditions. This
design ensures that the network can balance stability, communication efficiency, and global noise reduction performance. For
completeness, a synchronous DMCANC (SCDMCANC) variant is
also considered in this work. It employs the same WCFxLMS adaptation and MWD combination rules as the proposed ACDMCANC,
differing only in the communication strategy, where all nodes communicate simultaneously once any node triggers a communication
event.

**4. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS**


In this section, numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the
performance of ACDMCANC system. The primary and secondary
acoustic paths are measured in a real noise chamber equipped with
an ANC window. The system configuration follows the setup in

[24], consisting of six ANC nodes. The lengths of the secondary
paths, compensation filters, and control filters are set to 256, 33, and
512, respectively. The sampling frequency is 16 _,_ 000 Hz. The center
point � **w** _k_ is initialized to zero, corresponding to the leaky FxLMS
algorithm [1], which allows the penalty factor to be selected by the
conventional rule.
The proposed ACDMCANC system is compared against three
representative approaches: (i) the centralized MEFxLMS algorithm

[15], (ii) the MGDFxLMS algorithm [24], and (iii) the SCDMCANC
system. For simplicity, we assume that there is no transmission

ANC nodes is defined as

tween the two nodes highlight the asynchronous nature of the system. These results confirm that the proposed WCFxLMS and MWD
methods can operate effectively in heterogeneous networks, reducing communication frequency while maintaining flexibility and applicability across different network conditions.

**4.2. Real recorded noise reduction performance**


In this case, a real recorded compressor noise is used as the primary
noise source. The step size for both SCDMCANC and ACDMCANC is set to 5 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [6], while the penalty factor is adjusted to
400. As shown in Fig. 4, the MGDFxLMS achieves nearly identical noise reduction performance to the centralized MEFxLMS at
the cost of high communication burden, which limits its feasibility
in real-time applications. In contrast, SCDMCANC and ACDMCANC reduce communication overhead by allowing nodes to communicate adaptively, though at the expense of slower convergence
and slightly lower final performance. Nevertheless, the incorporation of WCFxLMS and the MWD method ensures that both synchronous (SCDMCANC) and asynchronous (ACDMCANC) communication strategies can be flexibly adopted. In particular, asynchronous communication is advantageous in heterogeneous network
environments, enhancing the universality and robustness of the DMCANC framework.

**5. CONCLUSION**


This paper introduced an asynchronous communication strategy for
DMCANC (ACDMCANC), aiming to reduce the excessive communication burden inherent in conventional distributed systems. By
integrating the weight-constrained FxLMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm
with a mixed weight difference (MWD) combination rule, each node
can maintain stability during non-communication phases while flexibly incorporating global information when communication is triggered. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers a promising balance between performance, communication efficiency, and robustness. Moreover, asynchronous communication
provides greater adaptability to heterogeneous networks, which is
essential for real-world deployment.

**4.1. Broadband noise reduction performance**


In this case study, the primary noise is broadband noise ranging from
100 to 1 _,_ 000Hz to evaluate the proposed method. The step size for
all algorithms is fixed at 1 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [6], and the penalty factor is set to 800
for all nodes. The time interval for calculating the RNL is _T_ = 0 _._ 3s.
As shown in Fig. 3(a), the MGDFxLMS achieves nearly the same
noise reduction performance as the centralized MEFxLMS, since
it is directly derived from the centralized algorithm with modifications suitable for distributed control. The SCDMCANC also attains
comparable performance to both MGDFxLMS and MEFxLMS.
However, because RNL must be periodically checked to determine
whether communication is required, its communication frequency
is reduced. Unlike MGDFxLMS, which communicates at every
sampling point, this results in slower convergence. The proposed
ACDMCANC achieves satisfactory noise reduction performance,
although slightly inferior to the other methods. This limitation
arises because, under asynchronous communication, once a node
communicates and updates its control filter and constrained center
point, subsequent requests from other nodes may transmit weight
differences that miss certain accumulated historical gradient information. Nevertheless, the ACDMCANC still ensures effective
global noise reduction while enabling independent communication
for each node.

2 in ACDMCANC during the first 15 s. The timing differences be
