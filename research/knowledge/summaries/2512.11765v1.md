**HIGH-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS OF A TRADING GAME**
**WITH TRANSIENT PRICE IMPACT**


MARCEL NUTZ AND ALESSANDRO PROSPERI


Abstract. We study the high-frequency limit of an _n_ -trader optimal execution game in discrete time. Traders
face transient price impact of Obizhaeva–Wang type in addition to quadratic instantaneous trading costs
_θ_ (∆ _Xt_ ) [2] on each transaction ∆ _Xt_ . There is a unique Nash equilibrium in which traders choose liquidation
strategies minimizing expected execution costs. In the high-frequency limit where the grid of trading dates
converges to the continuous interval [0 _, T_ ], the discrete equilibrium inventories converge at rate 1 _/N_ to the
continuous-time equilibrium of an Obizhaeva–Wang model with additional quadratic costs _ϑ_ 0(∆ _X_ 0) [2] and
_ϑT_ (∆ _XT_ ) [2] on initial and terminal block trades, where _ϑ_ 0 = ( _n −_ 1) _/_ 2 and _ϑT_ = 1 _/_ 2. The latter model was
introduced by Campbell and Nutz as the limit of continuous-time equilibria with vanishing instantaneous
costs. Our results extend and refine previous results of Schied, Strehle, and Zhang for the particular case
_n_ = 2 where _ϑ_ 0 = _ϑT_ = 1 _/_ 2. In particular, we show how the coefficients _ϑ_ 0 = ( _n −_ 1) _/_ 2 and _ϑT_ = 1 _/_ 2 arise
endogenously in the high-frequency limit: the initial and terminal block costs of the continuous-time model
are identified as the limits of the cumulative discrete instantaneous costs incurred over small neighborhoods
of 0 and _T_, respectively, and these limits are independent of _θ >_ 0. By contrast, when _θ_ = 0 the discrete-time
equilibrium strategies and costs exhibit persistent oscillations and admit no high-frequency limit, mirroring
the non-existence of continuous-time equilibria without boundary block costs. Our results show that two
different types of trading frictions—a fine time discretization and small instantaneous costs in continuous
time—have similar regularizing effects and, in the limiting regime, select a canonical continuous-time model
with transient price impact and endogenous block costs.


1. Introduction


Transaction costs are a key consideration for financial institutions. In equity trading, the lion’s share of
costs is due to price impact, i.e., the fact that buy (sell) orders tend to push prices up (down). Following [2],
price impact is often modeled in reduced form, positing that each atomic trade mechanically leads to a
price change. Later models incorporate price resilience (transient impact), meaning that prices revert over
time once the buying or selling pressure ceases. The most tractable formulation is the Obizhaeva–Wang
model [17], which uses an exponential decay kernel. Starting with [9, 11], numerous works have added
quadratic instantaneous costs on the trading rate to the Obizhaeva–Wang impact cost. As illustrated in [11],
this “regularizes” the problem and leads to smoother optimal trading strategies; see also [13]. We refer
to [6, 25] for further background and extensive references on price impact. Strategic interactions between
several large traders are studied in game-theoretic models. This branch of the literature emerged to study
predatory trading, where one trader exploits the price impact of a second trader who needs to unwind a
position [18, 5]. For the Obizhaeva–Wang model regularized by quadratic instantaneous costs, [23] shows
that there is a unique Nash equilibrium, whose closed form is provided in [3]. While these works follow
the optimal execution literature in assuming that the unaffected price is a martingale, they have been
generalized in several directions, such as incorporating alpha signals [16], alpha signals and non-exponential
decay kernels [1], or self-exciting order flow [8].
The goal of the present paper is to shed light on the Nash equilibria of trading games in the Obizhaeva–
Wang model without regularization. Surprisingly, a naive formulation in continuous time does not admit an

equilibrium, as established by [19] and [3]. They further show that existence is restored if very specific costs
on block trades are added to the Obizhaeva–Wang impact cost. Namely, in a game with _n_ traders, a block
trade of size ∆ _X_ 0 at the initial time _t_ = 0 is charged _ϑ_ 0(∆ _X_ 0) [2], where _ϑ_ 0 := ( _n −_ 1) _/_ 2, and a block trade
∆ _XT_ at the terminal time _t_ = _T_ is charged _ϑT_ (∆ _XT_ ) [2], where _ϑT_ := 1 _/_ 2 (up to reparametrizing time). On
the open interval (0 _, T_ ), no additional costs are charged. For _n_ = 2 traders, as studied in [19], the initial
and terminal costs coincide. For general _n_, as studied in [3], the two costs differ, with _ϑ_ 0 depending directly
on _n_, making this adjustment even more surprising. Conversely, these works show that for general initial
inventories of the traders, no equilibrium exists unless _ϑ_ 0 and _ϑT_ have exactly the stated values. The two
works further motivate their models by asymptotic considerations. On the one hand, [19] shows that their
continuous-time equilibrium strategies are the high-frequency limits of _discrete-time_ equilibria. The discretetime models use Obizhaeva–Wang impact and an additional quadratic instantaneous cost _θ_ (∆ _Xt_ ) [2], where
_θ >_ 0 is arbitrary and fixed. The authors further show that without instantaneous costs, the high-frequency
limit does not exist because strategies oscillate. These results build on [21, 22, 20], which documented such
oscillations in different contexts; see also [15]. On the other hand, [3] shows that their equilibrium is the
limit of _continuous-time_ equilibria with quadratic instantaneous costs _ε_ ( _dXt/dt_ ) [2] as _ε_ 0.
_→_
The present work refines and extends the analysis of [19] in several ways. First, we generalize from _n_ = 2
to an arbitrary number _n_ of traders. We show that the high-frequency limits of discrete-time equilibria with
instantaneous costs _θ_ (∆ _Xt_ ) [2] recover the continuous-time model of [3] with the block cost coefficients _ϑ_ 0
and _ϑT_, which are distinct for _n >_ 2. Second, refining the results of [19], we show not only that the total
execution costs converge, but also how the different parts of the continuous-time model emerge in the highfrequency limit: The initial block costs are identified as the limits of the instantaneous costs accrued over
an initial interval [0 _, t_ 0] with arbitrary 0 _< t_ 0 _< T_ ; similarly, the terminal block costs are the limits of the
instantaneous costs accrued over an interval [ _t_ 0 _, T_ ]. Moreover, the “regular” Obizhaeva–Wang impact costs
of the continuous-time model are the limits of the Obizhaeva–Wang costs of the discrete-time models. Third,
we not only show the qualitative convergence of the equilibria, but also establish the convergence rate 1 _/N_
for the trading strategies, where _N_ is the number of trading periods in [0 _, T_ ]. Finally, we show that when
the discrete-time models are formulated without instantaneous costs ( _θ_ = 0), the equilibrium strategies
oscillate in the high-frequency limit. This yields a one-to-one correspondence between non-existence of
the high-frequency limits and non-existence of the continuous-time equilibria without block costs. This
correspondence is robust and even extends to fine details: For _n >_ 2, [3] shows that an equilibrium can exist
for particular initial inventories of the traders even when only one of the two coefficients _ϑ_ 0 and _ϑT_ has the
“correct” value—namely, when initial inventories are symmetric or sum to zero, respectively. We further link
this to high-frequency limits of discrete-time models where instantaneous costs are charged only on an initial
or terminal portion of the time interval.
Our results complement the analysis of [3] for vanishing instantaneous costs in continuous time. Taken
together, a high-level picture emerges: discretizing time has the same regularizing effect as adding a small
instantaneous cost in continuous time, and yields the same limit. This leads us to conjecture a universality
phenomenon: a broad class of trading frictions can be introduced to obtain existence of equilibria in trading
games with Obizhaeva–Wang price impact, and the small-friction limits of such regularizations all yield the
same model, namely Obizhaeva–Wang price impact with additional block costs as specified in [19] and [3].


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates and solves the discrete-time
models, while Section 3 recalls the corresponding continuous-time results. Section 4 states our main results:
the high-frequency limits of the discrete-time equilibrium strategies and costs (Theorems 4.1 and 4.2), as
well as the corresponding oscillatory asymptotics for _θ_ = 0 (Theorems 4.3 and 4.4). Appendix A provides a
closed-form expression for the discrete-time equilibrium strategies that is used in the high-frequency proofs.
Appendix B contains the proofs for the discrete-time results in Section 2, while Appendix C collects the
proofs for the main results in Section 4. Finally, Appendix D analyzes the high-frequency asymptotics when
instantaneous costs are charged only on an initial or terminal portion of the time interval.

2. Discrete-Time Equilibrium

2.1.grid **Model Specifications.** 0 = _t_ 0 _< t_ 1 _< · · · < tN_ = We consider _T_, and a filtered probability space _n ≥_ 2 agents trading a single risky asset on the discrete time (Ω _, F_ _,_ ( _Ft_ ) _t≥_ 0 _,_ P) where _F_ 0 is P-trivial.
The _unaffected_ price _S_ [0] = ( _St_ [0][)] _[t][≥]_ [0] [is a square-integrable, right-continuous martingale. The definitions below]
detail how trading generates transient price impact governed by the exponential _decay kernel G_ : R+ R+,
_→_

_G_ ( _t_ ) = _e_ _[−][ρt]_ _,_


where _ρ >_ 0. (A more general form is _G_ ( _t_ ) = _λe_ _[−][ρt]_, but we set _λ_ = 1 without loss of generality as all other
quantities can be rescaled accordingly.)


**Definition 2.1** (Admissible trading strategy) **.** Given a grid T = _t_ 0 _, . . ., tN_ and an initial inventory _x_ R,
_{_ _}_ _∈_
an _admissible trading strategy_ is a vector _**ξ**_ = ( _ξ_ 0 _, . . ., ξN_ ) _[⊤]_ of random variables such that

(a) each _ξi_ is _Fti_ -measurable and bounded;
(b) _x_ = _ξ_ 0 + _· · ·_ + _ξN_ P-a.s.
We write _X_ ( _x,_ T) for the set of admissible strategies.

Intuitively, agent _i_ chooses _**ξ**_ _i_ = ( _ξi,_ 0 _, . . ., ξi,N_ ) _[⊤]_ _∈_ _X_ ( _xi,_ T), where _xi_ denotes the agent’s initial inventory
and _ξi,k_ is the number of shares traded at time _tk_, with the sign convention that _ξi,k >_ 0 is a sell and
_ξi,k <_ 0 is a buy. Condition (b) enforces liquidation by _tN_ = _T_ . Collecting agents’ strategies in the matrix
Ξ = [ _**ξ**_ 1 _, . . .,_ _**ξ**_ _n_ ], the (affected) price process is

In (2.1), the cross-term describes the standard (symmetric) tie-breaking rule that applies when agents
place orders at the same instant; see [20, 15]. In addition to the cost of transient impact, each trade incurs
quadratic instantaneous (or “temporary impact”) costs _θξi,k_ [2] [; see [][10][] for a related discussion.]


2.2. **Nash Equilibrium.** Fix a grid T and initial inventories ( _x_ 1 _, . . ., xn_ ). Each agent _i_ is risk-neutral and
chooses an admissible strategy to minimize the expected execution cost (2.1), where we may assume _St_ [0]
without loss of generality. This leads to the standard notion of Nash equilibrium. _[≡]_ [0]

An interpretation for _**v**_ and _**w**_ will be given in Remark 2.8.


The next lemma ensures that (2.3) is well-defined. We call a (possibly non-symmetric) square matrix _A_

we have _**ξ**_ _i_ _[∗]_ [=] _[ x]_ [1] _**[v]**_ [ for all] _[ i]_ [, whereas in the case] _[ x]_ [1][ +] _[ · · ·]_ [ +] _[ x][n]_ [ = 0][ of zero net supply,] _**[ ξ]**_ _i_ _[∗]_ [=] _[ x][i]_ _**[w]**_ [ for all] _[ i]_ [. Thus,]
_**v**_ and _**w**_ can be interpreted as the strategies for an agent with unit initial inventory in each of those cases.


3. Continuous-Time Equilibrium


This section recalls the continuous-time setting with _boundary block costs_ . We refer to [3, Section 2] for
further details and proofs.


3.1. **Model Specifications.** There are _n_ traders with inventory processes _X_ _[i]_ = ( _Xt_ _[i]_ [)] _t∈_ [0 _,T_ ] [. An] _[ admissible]_
_inventory X_ _[i]_ is càdlàg, predictable, has (essentially) bounded total variation, and satisfies _X_ 0 _[i]_ _−_ [=] _[ x][i][ ∈]_ [R]
and _XT_ _[i]_ [= 0][.] The _unaffected price S_ = ( _St_ ) _t≥_ 0 is a càdlàg local martingale with E[[ _S, S_ ] _T_ ] _< ∞_ . By
risk-neutrality (see [3, Proposition 2.2] for a detailed proof), we may assume _S ≡_ 0. As in the discrete-time
model, trading generates transient impact _I_ = ( _It_ ) _t≥_ 0 with the Obizhaeva–Wang dynamics



_dIt_ = _−ρIt dt_ + _λ_



_n_


_dXt_ _[i][,]_ _I_ 0 _−_ = 0 _._
_i_ =1



Collecting agents’ inventories in the vector _**X**_ = ( _X_ [1] _, . . ., X_ _[n]_ ) and setting _λ_ = 1 without loss of generality,
the (affected) price process is

In addition to the cost of transient impact, we charge quadratic _boundary block costs_ at _t_ = 0 and _t_ = _T_
with coefficients _ϑ_ 0 _, ϑT_ 0. Given opponents’ strategies _**X**_ _[−][i]_, the execution cost of _X_ _[i]_ is then defined as

Thus, block trades at the initial and terminal times incur an additional quadratic cost governed by _ϑ_ 0 and _ϑT_,
respectively. The cross-term has the same interpretation as the discrete-time model.


3.2. **Nash Equilibrium.** A profile _**X**_ _[∗]_ = ( _X_ _[∗][,]_ [1] _, . . ., X_ _[∗][,n]_ ) is a Nash equilibrium if each _X_ _[∗][,i]_ is admissible
and

_C_ ( _Z |_ _**X**_ _[∗][,][−][i]_ ) _≥_ _C_ ( _X_ _[∗][,i]_ _|_ _**X**_ _[∗][,][−][i]_ ) for all admissible _Z._

Existence of an equilibrium depends crucially on the initial and terminal block cost coefficients _ϑ_ 0 and _ϑT_  there is a single choice yielding existence for general initial inventories.

**Theorem 3.1** (Continuous equilibrium, [3, Theorem 4.4, Corollary 4.6]) **.** _Let ϑ_ 0 = ( _n −_ 1) _/_ 2 _and ϑT_ = 1 _/_ 2 _._
_Then the unique Nash equilibrium is given by_

**Remark 3.2.** The stated values for the block cost coefficients _ϑ_ 0 _, ϑT_ are the unique “correct” choice for
this model. Indeed, for different values of _ϑ_ 0 _, ϑT_, equilibrium does not exist, except for particular initial
inventories. Specifically, [if and only ifThus, if both ¯ _ϑx_ = 00 = (, and if _n_ 1)3 _ϑ/_, Theorem 4.4] shows that if20 and = ( _ϑn −T_ = 11) _/_ 2 _/_ but2, then the only case with equilibrium is _ϑT ̸_ = 1 _/ ϑ_ 2, an equilibrium exists if and only if _T_ = 1 _/_ 2 but _ϑ_ 0 _̸_ = ( _n −_ 1) _x/_ 2 _i_, an equilibrium exists0, which yields the _x_ 1 = _· · ·_ = _xn_ .
trivial no-trade solution _̸_ _− X_ _[∗][,i]_ _≡_ 0. In the cases with existence, the equilibrium is given by ( _̸_ _≡_ 3.2).


4. High-Frequency Limits


We can now present our main results on the high-frequency limits of the discrete equilibrium strategies
and costs. In the case _θ >_ 0 of non-zero instantaneous costs, we show that the discrete equilibria converge to
the continuous-time equilibrium of Theorem 3.1 including the particular boundary block costs. Whereas for
_θ_ = 0, the limit does not exist, and this will be linked to the non-existence of a continuous-time equilibrium
when there are no boundary block costs (Remark 3.2). We fix initial inventories ( _x_ 1 _, . . ., xn_ ) R _[n]_ and
_∈_

where _**v**_ and _**w**_ are the vectors from (2.3). Note that time _t_ corresponds to the _nt_ -th trading date in T _N_ .
In view of Remark 2.8, _Vt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] is the time- _t_ inventory of an agent with unit initial inventory in the symmetric
case _x_ 1 = = _xn_ . Similarly, _Wt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] is the time- _t_ inventory of an agent with unit initial inventory in the
_· · ·_
case of zero net supply. Finally, _Xt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] _[,i]_ is the time- _t_ inventory of agent _i_ with initial inventory _xi_ .
We first focus on the case _θ >_ 0. The first result states the convergence of the strategies. More precisely,
the time- _t_ inventory _Xt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] _[,i]_ converges pointwise to the continuous-time inventory _Xt_ _[∗][,i]_ of Theorem 3.1 for
_t ∈_ (0 _, T_ ), and we establish the rate 1 _/N_ . Given the form of the strategies, convergence boils down to
_Vt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] g ( _t_ ) and _Wt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] f ( _t_ ), where f and g are defined in (3.3) and (3.4). At each of the boundaries
_→_ _→_
( _t_ = 0 and _t_ = _T_ ), one of these limits fails, whence the convergence of the strategies only on the open
interval (0 _, T_ ).


**Theorem 4.1** (Convergence of strategies for _θ >_ 0) **.** _If θ >_ 0 _, we have_

_Xt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] _[,i]_ _−→_ _Xt_ _[∗][,i][,]_ _for any t ∈_ (0 _, T_ ) _._

_More precisely:_

_(a) For any t_ (0 _, T_ ] _, the sequence N_ _Vt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] g ( _t_ ) _is bounded, and V_ 0 [(] _[N]_ [)] = 1 _for all N_ _._

We emphasize that the limits are _independent_ of the specific value of _θ >_ 0.

A similar conclusion holds for the costs. We show not only the convergence of the total cost, but also that
the specific boundary block costs _B_ 0 and _BT_ arise as the limits of the instantaneous costs incurred near the
boundaries _t_ = 0 and _t_ = _T_, respectively. Hence, the coefficients _ϑ_ 0 and _ϑT_ in Theorem 3.1 arise naturally
from the high-frequency limit, and they are canonical in that the limit does not depend on the value of _θ_ as
long as _θ >_ 0.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the persistent oscillations of the inventories _V_ [(] _[N]_ [)] and _W_ [(] _[N]_ [)] near the boundaries
_t_ = 0 and _t_ = _T_, whereas in the interior (0 _, T_ ) the jumps of the inventories are _O_ (1 _/N_ ); see Theorem 4.1.
The cumulative instantaneous costs of the oscillations near the boundaries tend to _B_ 0 and _BT_ ; see (4.4).
Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 show convergence to a limit (independent of _θ_ ) whenever _θ >_ 0. By contrast,
without instantaneous costs ( _θ_ = 0), the optimal strategies and the costs both oscillate and do not converge.
The following theorems make this precise; for brevity, we use the constants d1 _,_ d2 _,_ a _±_ ( _t_ ) _,_ b( _t_ ) _,_ c( _t_ ) detailed in

Recall that Remark 3.2 identified two special configurations of the initial inventories where continuoustime equilibrium exists even though one of the two boundary block costs _ϑ_ 0 _, ϑT_ does not have the “correct”


9


value. That phenomenon has no analogue in Theorems 4.3 and 4.4, which feature a single parameter _θ_
for the entire time interval. Appendix D analyzes the behavior of the equilibrium inventories in a richer
discrete-time model where the cost functional is modified by charging instantaneous costs only on either the
first or the second half of the time interval; this amounts to a time-dependent _θ_ . When the cost is charged
only on the second half (and there is no cost on the first half), the discrete-time inventories converge to the
continuous-time equilibrium in the zero-net-supply case, whereas when the cost is charged only on the first
half, convergence holds in the symmetric case. Thus, for those special configurations of the initial inventories,
convergence of the discrete-time models with costs on the first/second half is in one-to-one correspondence
with the existence of a continuous-time equilibrium when the initial/terminal block cost is specified correctly.
This completes the overall picture that emerges from the preceding theorems: any positive instantaneous
costs give rise to the “correct” boundary block costs in the limit, whereas absence of instantaneous costs
leads to failure of convergence, corresponding to non-existence of equilibrium in the continuous-time setting.


Appendix A. Closed Form of the Discrete-Time Equilibrium


The goal of this section is to obtain an explicit formula for the discrete-time equilibrium of Theorem 2.7.
For that, we only need to derive a formula for _**v**_ . The formula for _**w**_ is the same as in [19] which treats the
case of _n_ = 2 traders; indeed, by Remark 2.4, _**w**_ does not depend on _n_ . Recall the time grid T _N_ in (4.1) and
the matrices Γ _[θ]_, Γ in (2.2). Define the following column vectors of length _N_ + 1,

[�]

(A.1) _**ν**_ := (Γ _[θ]_ + ( _n −_ 1)Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1** _,_ _**ω**_ := (Γ _[θ]_ _−_ Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1** _._


Then, by (2.3),


1 1
(A.2) _**v**_ = _**w**_ =
**1** _[⊤]_ _**ν**_ _**[ν]**_ _[,]_ **1** _[⊤]_ _**ω**_ _**[ω]**_ _[.]_


Generalizing [19], we set


_α_ := _e_ _[−][ρT/N]_ _,_ _κ_ := 2 _θ_ + ( _n −_ 1) _/_ 2 _,_ Γ := Γ [0] _,_


and introduce the matrix

_B_ := (1 _−_ _α_ [2] )(Id +Γ _[−]_ [1] (( _n −_ 1)Γ + 2 [�] _θ_ Id)) _._

From (A.1) we then have


(A.3) _**ν**_ = (Γ _[θ]_ + ( _n −_ 1)Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1** = (1 _−_ _α_ [2] ) _B_ _[−]_ [1] Γ _[−]_ [1] **1** _._


Moreover, the inverse of the Kac–Murdock–Szegő matrix Γ is the tridiagonal matrix

_Proof._ We have

(A.5) _δ_ 1 = 1 _−_ _nα_ [2] + _κ_

and



(A.6) _δ_ 2 = _−nα_ [4] ( _κ −_ _n_ ) _−_ _nα_ [2] ( _κ_ + 2) + ( _κ_ + 1) [2] _._



For _k ∈{_ 3 _, . . ., N_ _}_, the _k_ th principal minor _δk_ satisfies the recursion



_δk_ = (1 + _α_ [2] ( _κ −_ _n_ ) + _κ_ ) _δk−_ 1 _−_ _α_ [2] _κ_ ( _κ_ + 1 _−_ _n_ ) _δk−_ 2 _._



This is a homogeneous linear difference equation of second-order. Its characteristic equation is



(A.7) _m_ [2] _−_ (1 + _α_ [2] ( _κ −_ _n_ ) + _κ_ ) _m_ + _α_ [2] _κ_ ( _κ_ + 1 _−_ _n_ ) = 0 _._

The roots of (A.7) are

_m±_ = [1 +] _[ α]_ [2][(] _[κ][ −]_ _[n]_ [) +] _[ κ][ ±][ R]_ _._

2

We first claim that _m_ + and _m−_ are real for _α ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] and _κ ≥_ _[n][−]_ 2 [1] [. This is equivalent to the nonnegativity]

of the radicand in _R_, which in turn is equivalent to

_f_ ( _t_ ) := _t_ [2] ( _κ −_ _n_ ) [2] _−_ 2 _t_ ( _κ_ ( _κ_ + 1) + _n_ (1 _−_ _κ_ )) + ( _κ_ + 1) [2] _≥_ 0 _,_ 0 _≤_ _t ≤_ 1 _,_

after setting _t_ = _α_ [2] . The claim is clear for _κ_ = _n_ since

_−_ 2 _t_ ( _n_ [2] + 2 _n −_ _n_ [2] ) + _n_ [2] + 2 _n_ + 1 = _n_ [2] + 1 + 2 _n_ (1 _−_ 2 _t_ ) _≥_ ( _n −_ 1) [2] _≥_ 0 _._

Otherwise, _f_ is minimized at

_t_ 0 := _[κ]_ [(] _[κ]_ [ + 1) +] _[ n]_ [(1] _[ −]_ _[κ]_ [)] _._

( _κ −_ _n_ ) [2]


11



We have _t_ 0 _<_ 1 iff _κ <_ _[n]_ [2] _[−]_ [2]




_>_ 0 for all _t_ . For
( _κ−n_ ) [2]



_κ_
_≥_ _[n]_ _n_ [2] +1 _[−]_ [2] [, we have] _[ t]_ [0] _[ ≥]_ [1][ and, in turn,] _[ f][ ′]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[ ≤]_ [0][ for][ 0] _[ ≤]_ _[t][ ≤]_ [1][, so] _[ f]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[ ≥]_ _[f]_ [(1) = (] _[n][ −]_ [1)][2] _[ >]_ [ 0][. This proves]

that _m±_ are real.
By the theory of second-order linear difference equations, every solution of (A.7) has the form _c_ 1 _m_ _[k]_ + [+] _[c]_ [2] _[m][k]_ _−_
with real constants _c_ 1 _, c_ 2; see [14, Theorem 3.7]. Imposing the initial conditions (A.5)–(A.6) yields _c_ 1 = _c_ +
and _c_ 2 = _c−_, as stated.

**Lemma A.2.** _Define the sequence ϕk recursively by_

_Then, for k ∈{_ 2 _, . . ., N_ + 2 _},_



_ϕk_ = _d_ + _m_ _[N]_ + [+2] _[−][k]_ + _d−m_ _[N]_ _−_ [+2] _[−][k]_ _,_

Then _ψk_ = _ϕN_ +2 _−k_ . As in the proof of Lemma A.1, the general solution to (A.9) is _d_ 1 _m_ _[l]_ + [+] _[ d]_ [2] _[m]_ _−_ _[l]_ [with] _[ m][±]_

_where δ_ 0 = 1 _and δN_ +1 = det _B._

_Proof._ We have shown in Lemma 2.5 that both Γ and Γ _[θ]_ + ( _n −_ 1)Γ [�] are invertible. Thus

_B_ = (1 _−_ _α_ [2] )Γ _[−]_ [1] (Γ _[θ]_ + ( _n −_ 1)Γ) [�]

is also invertible. Hence _δN_ +1 = 0, so the right–hand side of (A.10) is well defined. In view of Lemmas A.1

_Proof._ The representation (A.11) for the components of _**ω**_ was proved in [20, Equation (16)] in the case
_n_ = 2. (Note that our vector _**ω**_ is denoted by _**u**_ in [20], our _α_ corresponds to _a_ [1] _[/N]_ there, and we have _λ_ = 1
here.) By Remark 2.4, _**ω**_ does not depend on _n_, so the same formula holds for any _n_ . For _**ν**_, recall from
(A.3) that
_**ν**_ = (Γ _[θ]_ + ( _n −_ 1)Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1** = (1 _−_ _α_ [2] ) _B_ _[−]_ [1] Γ _[−]_ [1] **1** _._

Appendix B. Proofs for Section 2


We first show uniqueness.


**Lemma B.1.** _For a given time grid_ T _and initial inventories_ ( _x_ 1 _, . . ., xn_ ) _, there exists at most one Nash_
_equilibrium in the class_ [�] _i_ _[X]_ [ (] _[x][i][,]_ [ T][)] _[.]_


_Proof._ This is a special case of the uniqueness result stated in [4, Theorem 5.1] for a general class of models.
To embed the present discrete-time model in that continuous-time setting, we specify an infinite cost for
strategies acting outside the grid T; cf. [4, Section 2.3]. 

Next, we reduce the existence proof to the class


_Xdet_ ( _x,_ T) := _**ξ**_ _X_ ( _x,_ T) _**ξ**_ is deterministic
_{_ _∈_ _|_ _}_

of deterministic strategies. A Nash equilibrium in the class _X_ det( _x_ 1 _,_ T) _X_ det( _xn,_ T) is defined in the
_× · · · ×_
same way as in Definition 2.3 and called a deterministic Nash equilibrium.


**Lemma B.2.** _A Nash equilibrium in the class X_ det( _x_ 1 _,_ T) _X_ det( _xn,_ T) _of deterministic strategies is_
_also a Nash equilibrium in the class X_ ( _x_ 1 _,_ T) _X_ ( _x × · · · ×n,_ T) _of adapted strategies._
_× · · · ×_

_Proof._ We follow [20, Lemma 3.4]. Assume that ( _**ξ**_ 1 _[∗][, . . .,]_ _**[ ξ]**_ _n_ _[∗]_ [)][ is a Nash equilibrium in the class] _[ X]_ [det][(] _[x]_ [1] _[,]_ [ T][)] _[ ×]_

_· · ·×_ _X_ det( _xn,_ T) of deterministic strategies. We need to show that _**ξ**_ _i_ _[∗]_ [minimizes][ E][[] _[C]_ [T][(] _**[ξ]**_ _[|]_ _**[ξ]**_ _−_ _[∗]_ _i_ [)]][ over] _[ X]_ [ (] _[x][i][,]_ [ T][)][,]
for anyApplying Jensen’s inequality to the convex map _i_ . To this end, fix _**ξ**_ _∈_ _X_ ( _xi,_ T) and define R _[N]_ [+1] _**ξ**_ _∋ ∈_ _**x**_ _�→X_ det _**x**_ _[⊤]_ (Γ _x_ _[θ]_ _i,_ _**x**_ T gives) by _ξk_ = E[ _ξk_ ] for _k_ = 0 _,_ 1 _, . . ., N_ .

We can now establish the main theorem on the discrete-time equilibrium.


_Proof of Theorem 2.7._ We adapt [15, Theorem 2.4]. Recall that uniqueness was shown in Lemma B.1. By
Lemma B.2, it then suffices to show that the strategies stated in Theorem 2.7 form a deterministic Nash
equilibrium. In view of Lemma 2.6, we thus need to show that

equilibrium and the proof is complete. 


We mention that the proofs in this section remain valid if the exponential kernel _G_ is generalized to an
arbitrary positive definite kernel (in the sense of Bochner).


Appendix C. Proofs for Section 4


The proofs for the high-frequency asymptotics of Section 4 involve rather lengthy expressions. We start
with some abstract remarks and notation intended to make the exposition more concise. While the quantities
introduced in Appendix A (e.g., _α_, _**ν**_, _**ω**_ ) depend on the trading frequency _N_, we usually suppress this
dependence for brevity. Throughout, we let _N ↑∞_, so, for example, we write

lim
_N_ _↑∞_ _[α]_ [ = lim] _N_ _↑∞_ _[e][−][ρT/N]_ [ = 1] _[.]_

For _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ] we recall the discrete trading index _nt_ = _⌈Nt/T_ _⌉_ and denote the distance between _Nt/T_ and
the subsequent grid point by



_ηt_ _[N]_ [:=] _[ n][t]_

_[−]_ _[Nt]_ _T_




[0 _,_ 1) _._
_T_ _∈_



This will appear, for example, when first-order terms depend on _nt_ .
Rather than expanding every expression directly in powers of _N_ _[−]_ [1], it will be often convenient to introduce
the small parameter ∆:= 1 _−_ _α_ = 1 _−_ _e_ _[−][ρT/N]_ _._ A Taylor expansion at 0 yields




_[ρT]_

_N_ 2 _N_ [2]

_[−]_ [(] _[ρT]_ [)][2]




[∆] [∆][2]

_ρT_ [+] 2 _ρT_



∆= _[ρT]_




_[ρT]_ [)] 1 [∆]

[+] _[ O]_ [(] _[N]_ _[−]_ [3][)] _[,]_
2 _N_ [2] _N_ [=] _ρT_



2 _ρT_ [+] _[ O]_ [(∆][3][)] _[.]_



Hence _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) and _o_ (∆ _[p]_ ) are interchangeable; we switch between these two symbols as convenient.
All the functions we manipulate are real-analytic in the neighborhoods we consider. Two consequences,
often used without further comment, are the following.



(a) _Stability under algebraic operations._ If _AN_ = _a_ 0 + _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) and _BN_ = _b_ 0 + _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ), then



_AN ± BN_ = ( _a_ 0 _± b_ 0) + _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) _,_ _AN_ _BN_ = _a_ 0 _b_ 0 + _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) _,_



and, provided _b_ 0 = 0,
_̸_ _AN_
= _[a]_ [0]
_BN_ _b_ 0




[0]

+ _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) _._
_b_ 0



Thus sums, products, and quotients preserve the error order.
(b) _Stability under composition._ If _XN_ = _x_ 0 + _rN_ with _rN_ = _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) and _h_ is real-analytic on a
neighborhood _U_ of _x_ 0, then by Taylor’s formula with Lagrange remainder, for any fixed _q_ N and
_∈_
all sufficiently large _N_,




[0] _[N]_ _[N]_

( _q_ + 1)! _rN_ _[q]_ [+1] _,_ _ζN ∈_ (0 _,_ 1) _._



_h_ ( _XN_ ) =



_q_



_k_ =0



_h_ [(] _[k]_ [)] ( _x_ 0)




[)] ( _x_ 0)

_rN_ _[k]_ [+] _[h]_ [(] _[q]_ [+1)][(] _[x]_ [0][ +] _[ ζ][N]_ _[r][N]_ [)]
_k_ ! ( _q_ + 1)!


15


Hence, if _rN_ = _O_ ( _N_ _[−][m]_ ) and ( _q_ + 1) _m > p_, the remainder is _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ). In particular, in our setting,
compositions of finitely many analytic maps preserve _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) remainders (equivalently _o_ (∆ _[p]_ )). Typical uses below include _h_ ( _x_ ) = 1 _/x_ (with _x_ 0 = 0), _h_ ( _x_ ) = ~~_x_~~ (with _x_ 0 _>_ 0), log _x_ (with _x_ 0 _>_ 0), and
their compositions. _̸_ _[√]_

Whenever a quotient of two analytic expansions is required, we identify the coefficients via the standard
series-division rule below; see also [7, § 67]. This will be used repeatedly when taking quotients of closed
forms and extracting leading constants.

The subsequent proofs proceed by expanding all discrete objects using the conventions above, together
with (C.1), to organize remainders into _o_ ( _N_ _[−][p]_ ) at the target order.


C.1. **Proof of Theorem 4.1 (b).** We remark that the convergence of _Wt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] to f ( _t_ ) for _t_ [0 _, T_ ), without
_∈_
a rate, already follows from [19, Theorem 3.1(c)] as _W_ [(] _[N]_ [)] is independent of _n_ by Remark 2.4. Next, we
establish the 1 _/N_ rate and recover their result as a by-product. We observe that (in contrast to the statement
in [19, Theorem 3.1(c)], which seems to have a glitch) the sequence _WT_ [(] _[N]_ [)] does not converge to f ( _T_ ).

which yields the stated claim at _t_ = _T_ .
Now fix _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ) and apply (C.1)–(C.2). A direct calculation (whose details we omit for the sake of
brevity) yields

This proves the claimed _O_ ( _N_ _[−]_ [1] ) rate of convergence to f ( _t_ ) for every fixed _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ).

C.2. **Proof of Theorem 4.1 (a).** We state separately the proofs for _κ_ = _n −_ 1 and _κ ̸_ = _n −_ 1. The
details are different because the general representation for the sum of the components of _**ν**_ in (C.7) involves
denominators that vanish exactly at _κ_ = _n −_ 1, and therefore is not well defined at this value.

C.2.1. _Proof for κ_ = _n −_ 1 _._ Adapting arguments from [19], we first consider the case _κ_ = _n −_ 1, which
corresponds to _θ_ = _[n][−]_ [1]

following lemma.

The next lemma collects the limiting behavior of all quantities that appear in the derivation of the limiting
strategy and, subsequently, the limiting costs. In addition, for the case _θ >_ 0 (equivalently, _κ >_ ˆ _κ/_ 2)
we record first or second-order Taylor expansions used to compute the pointwise convergence rate of the
strategies.
For a sequence ( _aN_ ) _N_ _∈_ N and a real number _a_, we use the shorthand


( _aN_ ) _[n][t]_ _a_ : ( _aN_ ) _[n][t]_ = ( 1) _[n][t]_ _aN_ and lim
_→±_ _⇐⇒_ _−_ _|_ _|_ _[n][t]_ _N_ _→∞_ _[|][a][N]_ _[|][n][t]_ [ =] _[ a.]_


Recall that ∆= (1 _−_ _α_ ) and note that ∆ _→_ 0 as _N →∞_ . When convenient, we express expansions in the
variable ∆; see also the discussion at the beginning of Appendix C.

_Step 4: Expansion of Vt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] _._
The limit in (C.15) matches the right-hand side of (C.14) at _t_ = _T_, and (C.14) matches the limit from
(C.6) (obtained when _κ_ = _n −_ 1). Although the leading coefficient of the 1 _/N_ term depends on _θ_, the
convergence order remains 1 _/N_ for every _θ >_ 0. Plugging these into the definition of _V_ [(] _[N]_ [)] and applying
(C.1) once more yields the claim. 

C.3. **Proof of Theorem 4.2.** Let ( _**ξ**_ 1 _, . . .,_ _**ξ**_ _n_ ) be the equilibrium profile; we drop the star superscript and
suppress the _N_ -dependence of _**ξ**_ _i_ and related quantities to keep notation light. We start with a simple lemma
(valid for all _κ ≥_ _κ/_ ˆ 2).

Before proving Theorem 4.2, we recall that _vk_ corresponds to the _k_ -th element of the vector _**v**_ =
(R _v_ _[N]_ 1 _, . . ., v_ [+1] . _N_ +1) _∈_ R _[N]_ [+1], whereas _ξk_ corresponds to the ( _k_ + 1)-th element of the vector _**ξ**_ = ( _ξ_ 0 _, . . ., ξN_ ) _∈_


_Proof of Theorem 4.2._ By [19, (23)] we have



(C.18) **1** _[⊤]_ _**ω**_ =



_N_ +1


_ωi_ _ρT_ + 1 as _N_ _._
_i_ =1 _−→_ _↑∞_



Moreover, the limit of **1** _[⊤]_ _**ν**_ = [�] _i_ _[N]_ =1 [+1] _[ν][i]_ [ is given by (][C.5][) when] _[ κ]_ [ =] _[ n][ −]_ [1][, and by (][C.15][) when] _[ κ][ ̸]_ [=] _[ n][ −]_ [1]
with _κ >_ _[n][−]_ [1]

2 [. The limits of] _**[ ν]**_ _[⊤]_ [˜Γ] _**[ν]**_ [,] _**[ ω]**_ _[⊤]_ [(ˆ] _[κ]_ [˜Γ] _[ −]_ [˜Γ] _[⊤]_ [)] _**[ν]**_ [, and] _**[ ω]**_ _[⊤]_ [˜Γ] _**[ω]**_ [ are collected in Lemma][ C.7][. Substituting]
these into (C.16) yields the claim. Finally, we only need to prove (4.4), then (4.5) will follow automatically;
recall
_ξi,k_ = ¯ _xvk_ + ( _xi −_ _x_ ¯) _wk,_

where _**w**_ and _**v**_ are defined in (A.2). Without loss of generality, and to simplify explicit computations, we
can fix _c_ = 1 _/_ 2; the same argument remains valid replacing 1 _/_ 2 with any _c ∈_ (0 _,_ 1).
_Step 1: Back window_ [ _⌈N/_ 2 _⌉, . . ., N_ ] _, recovery of BT ._
Near _t_ = _T_ the _**w**_ -contribution dominates, hence (recall the indexing convention for _**ξ**_ is _{_ 0 _, . . ., N_ _}_ and
for _**v**_ and _**w**_ is _{_ 1 _, . . ., N_ + 1 _}_ )

_Proof of Theorem 4.3 (b)._ By Remark 2.4, _W_ [(] _[N]_ [)] is independent of _n_ . Hence the argument of [19, Theorem 3.1(d)], established fora straightforward limit computation yields the result. _n_ = 2, applies analogously in our setting for any _t ∈_ (0 _, T_ ). For _t_ = 0 and _t_ = _T_

_Proof._ Since _**ω**_ is independent of _n_, the third limits coincide with the 2–player case and are given by [19,
Lemma A.6]. Hence it suffices to establish, for _κ_ = _[n][−]_ [1]

2 [, the first two limits for] _[ N]_ [ even and odd. Moreover,]
as explained in the proof of Lemma C.7, the representations of

_**ν**_ _[⊤]_ Γ [˜] _**ν**_ and _**ω**_ _[⊤]_ [�] _κ_ ˆΓ [˜] _−_ Γ [˜] _[⊤]_ [�] _**ν**_

obtained there for _κ_ = _n_ 1 also hold for _κ_ = _[n][−]_ [1]

These limits are taken from [19, eq. (25), Proof of Theorem 3.1(d)], derived for the 2-player case; since _**ω**_
is independent of _n_ (Remark 2.4), the same limits apply here. In addition, we invoke (C.19) together with
Lemma C.8. Substituting these limits into the cost representation (C.16) yields the claim. 

Appendix D. Time-Varying Instantaneous Costs


In this appendix we present a numerical analysis of how the equilibrium strategies and their asymptotics
change when we charge instantaneous costs only on the first or second half of the time interval. This
construction is motivated by the continuous-time game, where we can specify the “correct” block cost at
0 but the “wrong” one at _T_ (or vice versa), and then an equilibrium exists only in the case of zero-net
supply (or symmetric initial inventories, respectively); see Remark 3.2. In the discrete-time model, a unique
equilibrium still exists in these half-grid instantaneous-cost configurations. However, the qualitative behavior
of the time- _t_ inventories changes substantially: when there is no instantaneous cost on one half of the grid,
exactly one of the two processes _V_ [(] _[N]_ [)] and _W_ [(] _[N]_ [)] develops oscillations on that half of the interval, and the
cluster points of the oscillating inventory are no longer the four cluster points from Theorem 4.3. In both
of the configurations described below, the inventories _X_ [(] _[N]_ [)] _[,i]_ converge to the corresponding continuous-time
equilibrium in precisely the cases singled out in Remark 3.2.


**Set-up.** We modify the matrix Γ _[θ]_ by turning the instantaneous-cost term on or off separately on the first
and second halves of the grid. Define


_H_ _[θ]_ := Γ [0] + 2 _θI,_ [�] _J_ _[θ]_ := Γ [0] + 2 _θI,_


where



_I_ := _I_ _I,_ _I_ - _ij_ :=
_−_ [�]

1 _,_ _i_ = _j, i ∈{⌈_ ( _N_ + 1) _/_ 2 _⌉_ + 1 _, . . ., N_ + 1 _}._



Thus _H_ _[θ]_ corresponds to charging instantaneous costs only on the second half of the time grid, while _J_ _[θ]_

corresponds to charging instantaneous costs only on the first half.
It can be shown that, if we replace Γ _[θ]_ by _H_ _[θ]_ or _J_ _[θ]_, the proof of Theorem 2.7 carries over. Hence the
equilibrium strategies are still of the form (2.4) with



( _H_ _[θ]_ + ( _n_ 1)Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1** ( _H_ _[θ]_ Γ) _[−]_ [1] **1**
_−_ _,_ _**w**_ := _−_ [�]

**1** _[⊤]_ ( _H_ _[θ]_ + ( _n −_ 1)Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1** **1** _[⊤]_ ( _H_ _[θ]_ _−_ Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1]



( _H_ _[θ]_ + ( _n_ 1)Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1**
(D.1) _**v**_ := _−_



_,_
**1** _[⊤]_ ( _H_ _[θ]_ _−_ Γ) [�] _[−]_ [1] **1**



and analogously with _H_ _[θ]_ replaced by _J_ _[θ]_ . We then define the time- _t_ inventories _V_ [(] _[N]_ [)] and _W_ [(] _[N]_ [)] from _**v**_ and
_**w**_ in each case, as in (4.2).



**Second-half instantaneous cost.** We first charge instantaneous costs only on the second half of the grid,
that is, we use the objective with _H_ _[θ]_ replacing Γ _[θ]_ . Numerically we observe that
��� _W_ ( _t_ _N_ ) f ( _t_ )��� 0 _._

_−_ _−→_

By contrast, _Vt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] does not converge to g ( _t_ ) on the whole interval [0 _, T_ ], but it does converge to g ( _t_ ) on

[ _T/_ 2 _, T_ ]. On [0 _, T/_ 2], the process _V_ [(] _[N]_ [)] exhibits oscillations and does not have a limit; see Figure 4. In
light of Remarkan equilibrium exists only in the zero-net-supply case 3.2, this reflects the continuous-time situation with ¯ _x_ = 0 and is given by _ϑ_ 0 _̸_ = ( _xn −i_ f (1) _t_ ). If we assume _/_ 2 and _ϑT_ = 1 ¯ _/x_ 2 = 0, where, we
recover the convergence of the discrete-time inventories _Xt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] _[,i]_ to the continuous-time equilibrium _xi_ f ( _t_ ).

Figure 4. Convergence of inventories for even/odd values of _N_ in the modified game with
cost functional _H_ [1] (instantaneous cost charged in second half). We also plot the cluster
points _β±_ and _γ±_ from Theorem 4.3 and note how they differ from the envelope of _Vt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] .


**First-half instantaneous cost.** Next, we charge instantaneous costs only on the first half of the grid, that
is, we use the objective with _J_ _[θ]_ replacing Γ _[θ]_ . In this case we observe numerically that
��� _V_ ( _t_ _N_ ) g ( _t_ )��� 0 _._

By contrast, _Wt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] converges f ( _t_ ) only on [0 _, T/_ 2]. On [ _T/_ 2 _, T_ ], the process _W_ [(] _[N]_ [)] oscillates and fails to
converge; see Figure 5. This behavior is consistent with Remark 3.2, which states that in the continuousand is given bytime game with _x ϑi_ g 0 = (( _t_ ). If we assume _n_ _−_ 1) _/_ 2 and _ϑ xT_ 1 _̸_ == 1 _· · ·/_ 2 =, an equilibrium exists only in the symmetric case _xn_, we recover the convergence of the discrete-time inventories _x_ 1 = _· · ·_ = _xn_
_Xt_ [(] _[N]_ [)] _[,i]_ to the continuous-time equilibrium _xi_ g ( _t_ ).


**Comparison with the cluster points from Theorem 4.3.** Finally, we note that the oscillatory envelopes
observed in Figures 4 and 5 differ from the cluster points from Theorem 4.3, which are driven by _N_ being
even or odd. In the half-grid instantaneous-cost setting, the oscillations are localized to the half of the grid
where cost is absent, and the associated cluster points are no longer determined by the even/odd parity of _N_
seen in the specification with no instantaneous costs.
