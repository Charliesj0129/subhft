**Abstract**


We define a function of two real vectors by a certain homogeneous quotient involving power sums, and show that its supremum grows asymptotically linearly w.r.t. the dimension. From this, we deduce a condition
under which a parametric set of real matrices satisfies a set of polynomial positivity constraints. This characterization finds an application in
mathematical finance, in a recent study on price impact models.

### **1 Introduction**


Reznick [Rez83] has shown, among other results, that the maximum of



_n_ �� _n_

- _xi_ 
_i_ =1 _i_ =1



_n_ �2

over R _[n]_ is of order _[√]_ ~~_n_~~ ~~,~~ as _n →∞_ . Our contribution is an analytical investigation of a homogeneous quotient involving _differences_ of power sums in high
dimension, motivated by recent work on price impact models in mathematical
finance [HMMK25]. With _Mp_ ( _x_ ) := [�] _i_ _[n]_ =1 _[x]_ _i_ _[p]_ [for] _[ p >]_ [ 0, we prove the inequality]



_Q_ ( _x, y_ ) :=


=




 - _M_ 1( _x_ ) _−_ _M_ 1( _y_ )�� _M_ 2( _y_ ) _−_ _M_ 2( _x_ )�

and show that the constant factor is sharp as _n →∞_ . Put differently, we maximize the product - _∥x∥_ 1 _−∥y∥_ 1�� _∥y∥_ [2] 2 _[−∥][x][∥]_ 2 [2] - over the _ℓ_ [3] -unit ball, with a focus
on large dimension. Note that this product is non-positive, if the two vectors
_x, y ∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ 0 [are ordered component-wise. It is easy to see, though, and will be]
shown below, that the supremum is always positive for _n ≥_ 2. In what follows,
we will also consider _Q_ ( _x, y_ ) for vectors _x ∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ [+1] 0 and _y ∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ 0 [of unequal]
length. In Section 3, we discuss an application: The bound allows to characterize a certain parametric set of matrices that arises in [HMMK25]. This is

also where the constraint of considering only vectors with positive entries comes
from. As a side remark, we note that there is a considerable computational
literature on optimization of homogeneous polynomials, and refer to [HS14] and
the references therein.

_n→∞_ _n_ [sup]

_Both assertions remain true if the condition x ∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ 0 _[is replaced by][ x][ ∈]_ [R] _>_ _[n]_ [+1] 0 _[.]_


First, we verify that _Q_ has positive values for all _n ≥_ 2.


**Lemma 2.2.** _For n_ = 1 _, we have_ max _x,y>_ 0 _Q_ ( _x, y_ ) = 0 _. Furthermore,_


sup         - _Q_ ( _x, y_ ) : _x, y ∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ 0� _>_ 0 _,_ _n ≥_ 2 _,_


_and_

_Proof._ For _n_ = 1, note that



_Q_ ( _x, y_ ) = [(] _[x][ −]_ _[y]_ [)(] _[y]_ [2] _[ −]_ _[x]_ [2][)]



_≤_ 0 _,_ _x, y >_ 0 _._

For _n ≥_ 2, define the vectors



_x_ ˆ [(] _[n]_ [)] := (1 _, . . .,_ 1

and define ˜ _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ [+1] 0 by adding another component _n_ _[−]_ [1] to ˆ _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] . For even _n_,
_Q_ (ˆ _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _y_ [(] _[n]_ [)] ) is a rational function of _n_ . Using a computer algebra system, it is
easily verified that this rational function is positive for real _n ≥_ 4. In particular,
_Q_ (ˆ _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _y_ [(] _[n]_ [)] ) _>_ 0 for integral _n ≥_ 4. Analogously, the same holds for odd _n ≥_ 5,
and we have _Q_ (˜ _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _y_ [(] _[n]_ [)] ) _>_ 0 for _n ≥_ 7. We can also use computer algebra to
find vectors _x, y_ with _Q_ ( _x, y_ ) _>_ 0 for the remaining finitely many cases. For
instance, we have _Q_ (ˇ _x,_ ˇ _y_ ) _≈_ 0 _._ 031 for

_Proof of Theorem 2.1._ We begin with the upper estimate. For _n_ = 1, we have


sup _Q_ ( _x, y_ ) = 0 _< c_ _[∗]_
_x,y>_ 0


by Lemma 2.2. To prove the upper bound (2.1) for _n ≥_ 2, it is convenient
to work on R _[n]_ _≥_ 0 _[\ {]_ [0] _[}]_ [ instead of][ R] _>_ _[n]_ 0 [. Suppose that] _[ Q]_ [ has a local maximum]
at ( _x, y_ ) = ( _ξ, η_ ) _∈_ R [2] _≥_ _[n]_ 0 _[\ {]_ [(0] _[,]_ [ 0)] _[}]_ [. The global maximal value is positive by]
Lemma 2.2, and so we may consider the logarithmic derivatives


_∂xi_ log _Q_ ( _x, y_ )��( _x,y_ )=( _ξ,η_ ) [=] _[ U]_ [(] _[ξ][i]_ [)] _[,]_ _∂yi_ log _Q_ ( _x, y_ )��( _x,y_ )=( _ξ,η_ ) [=] _[ V]_ [ (] _[η][i]_ [)] _[,]_


where


1 2 _t_ 3 _t_ [2]
_U_ ( _t_ ) :=
_M_ 1( _ξ_ ) _−_ _M_ 1( _η_ ) _[−]_ _M_ 2( _η_ ) _−_ _M_ 2( _ξ_ ) _[−]_ _M_ 3( _ξ_ ) + _M_ 3( _η_ )


and


1 2 _t_ 3 _t_ [2]
_V_ ( _t_ ) := _−_
_M_ 1( _ξ_ ) _−_ _M_ 1( _η_ ) [+] _M_ 2( _η_ ) _−_ _M_ 2( _ξ_ ) _[−]_ _M_ 3( _ξ_ ) + _M_ 3( _η_ ) _[.]_


If _ξi >_ 0, then we must have _U_ ( _ξi_ ) = 0, and if _ηi >_ 0, then _V_ ( _ηi_ ) = 0. As each
of the two quadratic polynomials _U, V_ has at most two zeros, we conclude that,
for a global maximum at ( _ξ, η_ ), their exist four numbers _α, β, γ, δ_ with


_ξi ∈{α, β,_ 0 _},_ _ηi ∈{γ, δ,_ 0 _},_ 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _n._


It thus suffices to consider



_x_ = ( _α, . . ., α_

1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _n,_ 0 _≤_ _j ≤_ _n −_ _i,_ (2.4)


1 _≤_ _k ≤_ _n,_ 0 _≤_ _l ≤_ _n −_ _k._


Then, for _x, y_ as in (2.3), we have



where



_Q_ ( _x, y_ ) = _[S]_ [1] _[S]_ [2] _,_ (2.5)

_S_ 3


_S_ 1 := _iα_ + _jβ −_ _kγ −_ _lδ,_

_S_ 2 := _−iα_ [2] _−_ _jβ_ [2] + _kγ_ [2] + _lδ_ [2] _,_

_S_ 3 := _iα_ [3] + _jβ_ [3] + _kγ_ [3] + _lδ_ [3] _._



Thus, we arrive at a rational function of ( _α, β, . . ., k, l_ ). By Lemma 2.2, the
supremum of this function in the domain defined by (2.4), with real variables


3


_i, j, k, l_, is positive. By homogeneity and symmetry, we may assume that _α_
and _γ_ are bounded. We proceed to determine the maximum of


_h_ ( _α, β, . . ., k, l_ ) := log( _S_ 1 _S_ 2 _/S_ 3) _,_


which yields an upper bound for _Q_ ( _x, y_ ). We define _h_ := _−∞_ for _S_ 1 _S_ 2 _≤_ 0,
but note that _h_ is finitely-valued and smooth in a neighborhood of any global
maximum. The partial derivatives of _h_ are


_hα_ = _u_ ( _α_ ) _i,_ _hβ_ = _u_ ( _β_ ) _j,_ _hγ_ = _v_ ( _γ_ ) _k,_ _hδ_ = _v_ ( _δ_ ) _l,_

We claim that _j_ = _l_ = 0 holds at any global maximum of _h_ . The following
argument rests on the identities

They show that no point in the interior of the domain of _h_ at which _h_ is _> −∞_
satisfies the first order conditions _hα_ = _· · ·_ = _hl_ = 0. Furthermore, if there was
a maximum at the boundary _j_ = _n −_ _i_, then (2.6) would imply


_hj_
_β_ [2] [=] _[ −]_ [2(] _[α]_ _S_ _[ −]_ 3 _[β]_ [)] _<_ 0 _,_


but then _h_ would _decrease_ as we cross the boundary in the _j_ -direction. The
only remaining possibility is a maximum at the boundary _j_ = 0 (equivalently,
we could put _β_ = 0), and similarly we can show from (2.7) that _l_ = 0. Moreover,
by symmetry, it suffices to consider _i ≤_ _k_ . For _n_ = 2, (2.1) is now easily verified.
By induction, we may assume _k_ = _n_, because otherwise the parameters _α, γ, i, k_
would be admissible for the problem with _n_ replaced by _k_, and we can simply
note that _c_ _[∗]_ _k < c_ _[∗]_ _n_ . Assuming 1 = _α > γ_, by symmetry and homogeneity, we
have formally reduced the problem of optimizing _Q_ to choosing


_x_ = (1 _, . . .,_ 1 _,_ 0 _, . . .,_ 0) _,_ _y_ = ( _γ, . . ., γ_ )

             - ~~��~~             _i_


with 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _n_ and 0 _< γ <_ 1. We will see, though, that the optimal _i_ for the
function _h_ is not an integer, which shows that the bound (2.1) is strict. We put
_i_ = _pn_ with unknown _p ∈_ (0 _,_ 1), and so our target becomes

It is elementary to show that ( _p −_ _γ_ )( _−p_ + _γ_ [2] ) _/_ ( _p_ + _γ_ [3] ), ( _p, γ_ ) _∈_ (0 _,_ 1) [2], has a
global maximum at ( _p_ _[∗]_ _, γ_ _[∗]_ ), with value _c_ _[∗]_ . This finishes the proof of (2.1).
Inspired by the upper estimate, we use the vectors


_x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] := (1 _, . . .,_ 1 _, n_ _[−]_ [1] _, . . ., n_ _[−]_ [1] ) _∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ 0 (2.8)
~~��~~         - ~~�~~
_⌊p_ _[∗]_ _n⌋_


and
_y_ [(] _[n]_ [)] := ( _γ_ _[∗]_ _, . . ., γ_ _[∗]_ ) _∈_ R _[n]_ _>_ 0 (2.9)


to prove the required asymptotic lower bound. From


_Mν_       - _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)][�] = _p_ _[∗]_ _n_ + O(1) _,_ _ν_ = 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 _,_


as _n →∞_ and
_Mν_       - _y_ [(] _[n]_ [)][�] = ( _γ_ _[∗]_ ) _[ν]_ _n_ + O(1) _,_ _ν_ = 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 _,_


we calculate



_Q_ - _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _, y_ [(] _[n]_ [)][�] =




- _p_ _[∗]_ _n −_ _γ_ _[∗]_ _n_ + O(1)�� _−p_ _[∗]_ _n_ + ( _γ_ _[∗]_ ) [2] _n_ + O(1)�

_p_ _[∗]_ _n_ + ( _γ_ _[∗]_ ) [3] _n_ + O(1)




      - _−p_ _[∗]_ + ( _γ_ _[∗]_ ) [2][�]
_∼_ [(] _[p][∗]_ _[−]_ _[γ][∗]_ [)] _n_ = _c_ _[∗]_ _n,_ _n →∞._

_p_ _[∗]_ + ( _γ_ _[∗]_ ) [3]



The proof of (2.1) and (2.2) is finished. Proving the remaining assertions is a
simple modification: The vector (2.8) from the lower bound receives an additional component _n_ _[−]_ [1] . The range of _i_ in the upper bound becomes 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _n_ +1,
which makes no essential difference. For the induction base, we need to compute


sup          - _Q_ ( _x, y_ ) : _x ∈_ R [2] _>_ 0 _[, y][ ∈]_ [R] _[>]_ [0]          - _._


We may assume _x_ 1 = 1, and it is then an easy exercise that the maximum of

_Q_ ( _x, y_ ) = [(1 +] _[ x]_ [2] _[ −]_ _[y]_ [)(] _[y]_ [2] _[ −]_ [1] _[ −]_ _[x]_ [2]

than 2 _c_ _[∗]_ .


### **3 Application**

For _d ≥_ 2, we define the set _Md_ of matrices _M_ = ( _mij_ ) _∈_ R _[d][×][d]_ such that




- _mllzl_ [3] [+] _[ s][l][z][l]_ - _mlkskzk_ [2] - _>_ 0 (3.1)

_k_ = _l_



Ψ _M_ ( _z, s_ ) :=



_d_



_l_ =1



for all _s ∈{±_ 1 _}_ _[d]_ and _z ∈_ R _[d]_ _>_ 0 [. In general, this gives 2] _[d][−]_ [1] _[ −]_ [1 inequalities which]
have to be satisfied by all _z ∈_ R _[d]_ _>_ 0 [, as] _[ s]_ [ and] _[ −][s]_ [ yield the same condition, and]
_s_ = (1 _, . . .,_ 1) can of course be discarded.

**Lemma 3.1.** _The set Md is a convex cone. Any matrix in Md has non-negative_
_diagonal elements. If M is diagonally dominant in the sense that_




- _|mlk|,_ 1 _≤_ _i ≤_ _d,_ (3.2)


_k_ = _l_



_mii >_



_d_



_l_ =1



_i.e. each diagonal element dominates the sum of the absolute values of all off-_
_diagonal elements, then M ∈Md. In particular, diagonal matrices with positive_
_diagonal elements are in Md._


_Proof._ The first statement is obvious. The second one is also clear, by considering large multiples of unit vectors. Now let _z ∈_ R _[d]_ _>_ 0 [and suppose that] _[ z][i]_ [is]
one of the maximal entries of the vector. Then we have for all _s ∈{±_ 1 _}_ _[d]_




- _mllzl_ [3] [+] _[ s][l][z][l]_ - _mlkskzk_ [2] 
_k_ = _l_



Ψ _M_ ( _z, s_ ) =

_k_ = _l_

The set _Md_ arises naturally in [HMMK25]. As elaborated there, positivity
of the term _h_ ( _**J**_ _t_ ) _[⊤]_ _**ζJ**_ _t_ in (6.1) of [HMMK25], for any vector _**J**_ _t_ = ( _Jt_ _[i]_ [), is]
crucial for the underlying model to make sense. For the standard choice _h_ ( _x_ ) =
sgn( _x_ ) ~~�~~ _|x|_ (square-root price impact), and with _zi_ = ~~�~~ _|J_ _[i][|]_ [ and] _[ M]_ [ =] _**[ ζ]**_ [, this]



_|x|_ (square-root price impact), and with _zi_ = ~~�~~



sgn( _x_ ) ~~�~~ _|x|_ (square-root price impact), and with _zi_ = ~~�~~ _|Jt_ _[i][|]_ [ and] _[ M]_ [ =] _**[ ζ]**_ [, this]

amounts to the condition (3.1). It is thus of interest to find conditions that
ensure _M ∈Md_, in particular for large dimensions. Presumably, it is hard
to give a simple general if-and-only-if condition. Even for _d_ = 2, where a full
characterization is possible, a complicated case distinction involving algebraic
expressions of the matrix elements _mij_ arises. Beyond the trivial case of diagonal
matrices of arbitrary dimension, a reasonable next step is to consider equal offdiagonal elements, and so we define

_Md_ ( _b_ ) :=

_k_ = _l_



**Lemma 3.2.** _For d ≥_ 2 _and b >_ 0 _,_ (3.4) _is equivalent to_


1
_b_ _[>]_ [ 1 +] _[ Q]_ [(] _[x, y]_ [)] _[,]_ _x ∈_ R _[⌈]_ _>_ _[d/]_ 0 [2] _[⌉]_ _, y ∈_ R _[⌊]_ _>_ _[d/]_ 0 [2] _[⌋]_ _._


_Proof._ We assume that _d_ is even, as the proof for odd _d_ is analogous. By
symmetry of (3.4), only the number of positive entries in _s ∈{±_ 1 _}_ _[d]_ is relevant,
not their position. Moreover, it suffices to consider



_s_ = ( _−_ 1 _, . . ., −_ 1

Indeed, the other sign combinations _s_ lead to a larger number of (+1)-s in the
matrix ( _sisj_ ). As the _zi_ are positive, this makes the desired inequality (3.4)
easier to satisfy. For _s_ as in (3.5), the second sum in (3.4) becomes

where
_x_ := ( _z_ 1 _, . . ., zd/_ 2) _,_ _y_ := ( _zd/_ 2+1 _, . . ., zd_ ) _._


As the first sum in (3.4) equals _M_ 3( _x_ ) + _M_ 3( _y_ ), the statement follows.


We can now state our main result on membership of (3.3) in the cone _Md_ .
While the naive criterion (3.2) shows that _b_ ≲ 1 _/d_ [2] suffices, we can infer from
Theorem 2.1 that the true asymptotic order of the maximal value of _b_ is 1 _/d_ for
large _d_ .


**Theorem 3.3.** _For d ≥_ 2 _, the set of admissible b for the matrices_ (3.3) _is an_
_interval with closure_

_Proof._ It follows from Lemma 3.1 that the set _{b >_ 0 : _Md_ ( _b_ ) _∈Md}_ is a
non-empty interval. By Lemmas 2.2 and 3.2, we have _Md_ ( _b_ ) _∈Md_ if and only
if
1
_b <_ 1 + max _{Q_ ( _x, y_ ) _,_ 0 _}_ _[,]_ _x ∈_ R _[⌈]_ _>_ _[d/]_ 0 [2] _[⌉]_ _, y ∈_ R _[⌊]_ _>_ _[d/]_ 0 [2] _[⌋]_ _._


This proves (3.6), and (3.8) and (3.9) follow from Theorem 2.1. To see that _bd_
decreases, let _d ≥_ 3 and _b, ε >_ 0 be such that _Md_ ( _b_ (1 + _ε_ )) _∈Md_ . Thus,
Lemma 3.2 implies


1 _> b_ (1 + _ε_ )�1 + _Q_ ( _x, y_ )� _,_ _x ∈_ R _[⌈]_ _>_ _[d/]_ 0 [2] _[⌉]_ _, y ∈_ R _[⌊]_ _>_ _[d/]_ 0 [2] _[⌋]_ _._


Taking _x⌈d/_ 2 _⌉_ _↓_ 0 for odd _d_ respectively _yd/_ 2 _↓_ 0 for even _d_ yields

1 _≥_ _b_ (1 + _ε_ )�1 + _Q_ ( _x, y_ )� _> b_ �1 + _Q_ ( _x, y_ )� _,_ _x ∈_ R _[⌈]_ _>_ [(] 0 _[d][−]_ [1)] _[/]_ [2] _[⌉]_ _, y ∈_ R _[⌊]_ _>_ [(] 0 _[d][−]_ [1)] _[/]_ [2] _[⌋]_ _._


Therefore, _Md−_ 1( _b_ ) _∈Md−_ 1. As _ε >_ 0 was arbitrary, we have shown that
_bd−_ 1 _≥_ _bd_ .

### **4 Numerical values**


For _d_ = 3, the optimization problem in (3.7) can be solved explicitly, as stated
at the end of the proof of Theorem 2.1. The number _b_ 3 is the only positive root
of the polynomial
20 _x_ [4] + 60 _x_ [3] + 9 _x_ [2] _−_ 54 _x −_ 27 _,_ (4.1)


with explicit expression

_b_ 3 = [1] 4



35 [(39 + 16] ~~_√_~~ 6) _−_ 3� _≈_ 0 _._ 962 _._ (4.2)



Alternatively, _bd_ can be computed by quantifier elimination [Stu17] from (3.4),
which also yields (4.1) and (4.2). As mentioned in the proof of Lemma 3.2,
it suffices to consider _s_ as in (3.5) for even _d_ . Analogously, for odd _d_, the
inequality (3.4) needs to be checked only for



_s_ = ( _−_ 1 _, . . ., −_ 1

~~�~~   - ~~�~~ ~~�~~
( _d_ +1) _/_ 2



_,_ 1 _, . . .,_ 1

~~�~~ - ~~�~~ ( _d−_ 1) _/_ 2



) _._



Still, quantifier elimination is computationally hard, and so we could calculate _bd_
with this method only until _d_ = 4. It turns out that _b_ 3 = _b_ 4. In principle, upper
bounds can be computed by using numerical optimization to approximate the
supremum in (3.7). It is not trivial, though, to find good starting values. Note
that the vectors (2.8) and (2.9) are not useful in that respect for small _n_ . In
fact, _Q_ ( _x_ [(] _[n]_ [)] _, y_ [(] _[n]_ [)] ) is negative for _n ≤_ 9. To compute the values _b_ 5 and _b_ 6 in
Table 1, we instead used Mathematica’s `FindInstance` and `Reduce` commands
to show that _Q_ in (3.7) can be larger than 100001079 [, but not] 100001080 [.]
Table 2 gives estimates for _bd_ for large _d_ . For the upper estimates, we
evaluate _Q_ at the vectors (2.8) with _n_ = _⌈d/_ 2 _⌉_ and (2.9) with _n_ = _⌊d/_ 2 _⌋_,
which yields an upper bound for the right hand side of (3.7). For large _d_ our
computations show that _bd_ is very close to _bd_ +1 for even _d_ . This is in contrast
to the fact that _b_ 3 = _b_ 4, as mentioned above.
