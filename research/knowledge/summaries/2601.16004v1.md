## Wigner’s Friend as a Circuit: Inter-Branch Communication Witness Benchmarks on Superconducting Quantum Hardware

Christopher Altman [*]


January 2026


**Abstract**


We implement and benchmark on IBM Quantum hardware the circuit family proposed by Violaris (2026) for estimating operational “inter-branch communication” witnesses, i.e., correlations in classical measurement records produced by compiled Wigner’s-friend-style circuits.
Concretely, we realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer
_pattern_ in the circuit (not physical signaling), and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes a branch-conditioned evolution
in which an observer subsystem _F_ (“Wigner’s friend”) evolves differently depending on the
state of a control qubit _Q_, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between branch-conditioned histories (conditional measurement contexts within a single
compiled circuit). We evaluate coherence-sensitive witnesses on a specified four-qubit subset.
Executing on the `ibm` ~~`f`~~ `ez` backend ( _N_ = 20 _,_ 000 shots), we obtain population-based visibility
_V_ = 0 _._ 8771 _±_ 0 _._ 0034, coherence witnesses _WX_ = 0 _._ 8398 _±_ 0 _._ 0038 and _WY_ = _−_ 0 _._ 8107 _±_ 0 _._ 0041,
and phase-sensitive magnitude _C_ mag = ( _WX_ [2] [+] _[ W]_ [ 2] _Y_ [)][1] _[/]_ [2][ = 1] _[.]_ [1673] _[ ±]_ [ 0] _[.]_ [0040.]


This work does not claim to test or discriminate among interpretations of quantum mechanics. Unitary interpretations that reproduce standard quantum predictions remain operationally
equivalent for these circuits. Instead, we frame the experiment as a publicly reproducible constraint pipeline: given a parameterized family of non-ideal channels (e.g., dephasing or collapselike perturbations) inserted at specified circuit locations, the coherence-sensitive witnesses define
detectability thresholds relative to calibrated device noise. The accompanying reproducibility
bundle provides full provenance (job IDs, calibration snapshots, software versions) enabling
independent verification and extension.

### **1 Introduction**


The Wigner’s friend thought experiment [1] and its extensions [2, 3] probe foundational questions
about unitary quantum dynamics, measurement, and observer perspectives. The quantum information community has increasingly adopted a “circuits-as-foundations” approach: encoding these
thought experiments as explicit quantum circuits that can be analyzed, simulated, and executed
on real quantum hardware [4, 5].

Violaris [6] proposes a family of inter-branch communication protocols in which operations on
a superposed “friend” register enable conditional message transfer between branch-conditioned
internal states. Branch interference effects, if present, should manifest in specific correlations that
can be probed via appropriately chosen observables. The protocol provides a concrete circuit
template suitable for near-term quantum processors.


**Contributions of this work.** We provide a publicly reproducible IBM-hardware execution of a
minimal branch-transfer circuit benchmark with the following features:


1. **Coherence-witness diagnostics:** Beyond the standard population-based visibility _V_, we
measure multi-qubit Pauli-parity correlators ( _WX_, _WY_ ) that are sensitive to off-diagonal
coherences potentially missed by _V_ .


2. **Backend-matched noise modeling:** We compare hardware results against Qiskit Aer
simulations using noise models derived from contemporaneous `ibm` ~~`f`~~ `ez` calibration data [7].


3. **Nonunitary channel constraint pipeline:** We demonstrate how parameterized dephasing
channels can be constrained relative to observed witness values and device-noise bands.


4. **Full provenance:** Job IDs, calibration snapshots, software versions, and SHA256 hashes for
all artifacts enable independent verification.


We emphasize what this work does _not_ claim: it does not uniquely test or confirm any interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Many-Worlds interpretation, Copenhagen-style collapse models,
and other unitary completions all predict identical measurement statistics for these circuits when
the evolution is unitary. The experiment’s value lies in (a) demonstrating that branch-transfer
primitives behave consistently with unitary predictions on real hardware, and (b) establishing a
methodology for constraining specific nonunitary perturbations should future experiments seek to
test such models.


**Related work.** Experimental implementations of Wigner’s-friend scenarios on quantum processors include the photonic realization by Proietti et al. [4] and the extended Wigner’s friend test by
Bong et al. [5]. Those works focus on Bell-type inequalities and local friendliness assumptions. Our
work differs in targeting the inter-branch communication primitive specifically and in emphasizing
coherence-witness diagnostics as a complement to population-based metrics. The IBM Quantum
platform [8] and Qiskit software stack [9, 10] provide the infrastructure for our hardware execution.


**Related constraint results.** Mukherjee and Hance [11] analyze timelike constraints on “absoluteness of observed events” assumptions in Wigner’s-friend settings. Our work is complementary:
we focus on an implementable circuit primitive inspired by inter-branch communication protocols
and report its empirical compilation and noise behavior on superconducting quantum hardware,
without adopting observer-independent event absolutism.

### **2 Protocol and Metrics**


**2.1** **Registers and Qubit Mapping**


The circuit uses five qubits in total, with four qubits measured for the coherence-witness protocol:


 - _Q_ : Control qubit determining branch superposition (logical index 0)


2


Figure 1: Branch-transfer circuit schematic (five-qubit primitive) as transpiled and executed on
hardware. Coherence-witness measurements act on the four-qubit subset ( _Q, R, F, P_ ); the auxiliary
qubit participates in the controlled transfer but is not measured in coherence-witness mode. Qubit
labels correspond to logical register assignments; physical qubit indices after transpilation are
recorded in the reproducibility bundle.


 - _R_ : Reference/ancilla qubit for message encoding (logical index 1)


 - _F_ : Friend register encoding the observer’s internal state (logical index 2)


 - _P_ : Probe qubit for readout correlations (logical index 3)


  - Logical index 4: Auxiliary qubit used in the branch-transfer primitive (not measured in
coherence-witness mode)


**Note on qubit labeling:** The indices 0–4 above refer to _logical_ register assignments in the abstract
circuit. After transpilation to hardware, these are mapped to physical qubit indices on the device;
the mapping is recorded in the reproducibility bundle ( `assets/bundles/wigner-friend-v2b/appendix/` ).
The coherence witnesses _WX_ and _WY_ are four-qubit Pauli correlators measured on ( _Q, R, F, P_ ).
The visibility protocol measures only two qubits ( _R_ and _P_ ).
The circuit consists of three stages: (i) preparation of branch-conditioned evolution where _F_ evolves
differently depending on the state of _Q_ ; (ii) application of a controlled message-transfer primitive
that creates correlations between _R_, _F_, and _P_ ; and (iii) measurement in either the computational
basis (for visibility) or rotated bases (for coherence witnesses).


**2.2** **Visibility** _V_ **: A Population-Based Diagnostic**


The visibility metric _V_ (corresponding to bundle mode `rp` `z` ) is extracted from Z-basis measurement
populations:
_V_ = �� _P_ ( _R_ = 0 _| P_ = 1) _−_ _P_ ( _R_ = 1 _| P_ = 1)�� _,_ (1)


where _P_ ( _R_ = _r | P_ = _p_ ) denotes the conditional probability of measuring qubit _R_ in state _r_ given
that qubit _P_ is measured in state _p_ .
**Key limitation:** Because _V_ depends only on diagonal (computational-basis) populations, it can
fail to detect suppression of off-diagonal density matrix elements. A dephasing channel inserted
at certain circuit locations may leave _V_ nearly unchanged while destroying coherences probed by
other observables. This limitation motivates direct coherence measurements.


3


**2.3** **Coherence Witnesses** _WX_ **,** _WY_ **, and** _C_ mag


We measure four-qubit Pauli-parity correlators on the subset ( _Q, R, F, P_ ):


_WX_ = _⟨XQ ⊗_ _XR ⊗_ _XF ⊗_ _XP ⟩,_ _WY_ = _⟨YQ ⊗_ _YR ⊗_ _YF ⊗_ _YP ⟩,_ (2)


where _X_ and _Y_ are the standard Pauli operators.


**Basis rotation procedure.** To measure _WX_, we apply a Hadamard gate _H_ to each of ( _Q, R, F, P_ )
immediately before Z-basis measurement. The expectation value is then computed from bitstring
counts as:
_WX_ = _[N]_ [even] _[ −]_ _[N]_ [odd] _,_ (3)

_N_ even + _N_ odd

where _N_ even ( _N_ odd) is the number of shots with even (odd) total parity across the four measured
bits.
To measure _WY_, we apply _S_ _[†]_ _H_ (where _S_ _[†]_ is the inverse phase gate) to each qubit before Zmeasurement, then compute parity analogously.


**Phase-sensitive magnitude.** We define:




  _C_ mag =



_WX_ [2] [+] _[ W]_ [ 2] _Y_ _[.]_ (4)



**Interpretation of** _C_ mag **:** This quantity is _not_ bounded by 1 and should not be interpreted as a
probability _√_ or “coherence fraction.” Since _WX_ _, WY ∈_ [ _−_ 1 _,_ 1] for any quantum state, _C_ mag is bounded
above by 2. For ideal statevector evolution with this circuit, _W_ [ideal] = 1 and _W_ [ideal] = _−_ 1, yielding



above by _√_ 2. For ideal statevector evolution with this circuit, _WX_ [ideal] = 1 and _WY_ [ideal] = _−_ 1, yielding

_C_ mag [ideal] [=] 2 _≈_ 1 _._ 414.



2 _≈_ 1 _._ 414.

```

**3.3** **Backend-Matched Noise Modeling**


We include baseline simulations using Qiskit Aer [7] with noise models constructed via
`NoiseModel.from_backend()` using contemporaneous calibration snapshots of `ibm` ~~`f`~~ `ez` .


These snapshots (stored in `assets/bundles/wigner-friend-v2b/appendix/` ) capture gate error
rates, readout errors, and _T_ 1/ _T_ 2 times at the time of execution.


Such backend-matched models are approximate: they may fail to fully capture drift, crosstalk,
leakage, and coherent errors not characterized by the calibration data. We therefore treat the noisy
simulation as a _calibrated proxy_ rather than a strict prediction, useful for understanding the noise
floor but not as ground truth.

### **4 Results**


Headline metrics for the branch-transfer primitive are summarized in Table 1.

Numeric values are extracted from bundled JSON artifacts or computed from stored fields using
declared formulas (e.g., _C_ mag = ~~�~~ _WX_ [2] [+] _[ W]_ [ 2] _Y_ [).] All source artifacts are integrity-checkable via

SHA256 hashes in `assets/bundles/wigner-friend-v2b/MANIFEST.json` .


**Interpretation of results.** Hardware values show degradation relative to ideal predictions, consistent with device noise. The visibility _V_ = 0 _._ 8771 on hardware is lower than the backend-matched
noisy simulation prediction ( _V_ = 0 _._ 9381), suggesting calibration drift, additional noise sources not
captured by the model, or transpilation effects at optimization level 2. Coherence witnesses _WX_
and _WY_ similarly show hardware degradation beyond the noisy simulation baseline.
Crucially, all measured values remain consistent with _unitary evolution plus device noise_ —no
anomalous deviations suggesting nonunitary physics are observed. The results establish a baseline for future comparisons.

### **5 Nonunitary Channel Constraint Pipeline**


We turn witness measurements into an exclusion bound on a parameterized channel family inserted
at specified circuit locations.


1. **Channel family:** Define a parameterized family of channels _Eλ_ (e.g., single-qubit dephasing
with strength _λ ∈_ [0 _,_ 1]) and specify the circuit insertion point.


2. **Predicted deviation curves:** For each _λ_, simulate the circuit with the channel inserted
and compute predicted values of _V_, _WX_, _WY_, _C_ mag.


6


3. **Detectability threshold:** A channel strength _λ_ is “detectable” if the predicted deviation in
at least one witness exceeds the combined uncertainty band (shot noise _⊕_ device-noise proxy
derived from backend-matched simulation discrepancy).


4. **Constraint:** The observed hardware values constrain the channel strength to _λ < λ_ max
where _λ_ max is the detectability threshold.


**Worked example (phase-flip dephasing estimate).** Consider a single-qubit phase-flip
(dephasing) channel applied to the friend register after the branch split,


_Eλ_ ( _ρ_ ) = (1 _−_ _λ_ ) _ρ_ + _λ ZρZ._ (5)


For observables containing Pauli _X_ or _Y_ on the friend qubit (which anticommute with the
error operator _Z_ ) on the friend qubit, the channel attenuates expectations by a factor (1 _−_ 2 _λ_ ).
To first order, the coherence witnesses scale as


_WX_ ( _λ_ ) _≈_ (1 _−_ 2 _λ_ ) _WX_ (0) _,_ _WY_ ( _λ_ ) _≈_ (1 _−_ 2 _λ_ ) _WY_ (0) _._ (6)


Using the ideal value _WX_ (0) _≈_ 1 and the measured hardware value _WX_ [(hw)] = 0 _._ 8398, we obtain
the illustrative estimate
_λ_ est _≈_ [1] _[−][W]_ 2 [ (hw)] _X_ = 0 _._ 080 _._ (7)


In the full pipeline we use backend-matched noisy simulation to define the detectability band
and report the corresponding _λ_ max as the conservative bound for the chosen insertion point
and channel family.


**Terminology note:** We refer to the channel family as a “parameterized dephasing/nonunitary
channel toy model” rather than labeling it with interpretation-specific names (e.g., “Copenhagen
collapse”). The constraint applies to the channel family under the assumed insertion point and
noise calibration; it does not uniquely identify physical mechanisms.
The bundled forecast panels (Figures 3a and 3b) illustrate how coherence witnesses degrade as
channel strength increases, while diagonal visibility can remain comparatively insensitive depending
on where the channel is inserted. This motivates the use of _WX_ and _WY_ as primary diagnostics for
any future searches for nonunitary deviations.

### **6 Interpretation**


**What this does not establish.** This experiment does not uniquely test, confirm, or refute any
interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Many-Worlds interpretation, Copenhagen interpretation, relational quantum mechanics, QBism, and other frameworks that reproduce standard quantum mechanical predictions are _operationally equivalent_ for these circuits. A visibility of _V ≈_ 0 _._ 88
and coherence magnitude _C_ mag _≈_ 1 _._ 17 are consistent with all such interpretations plus realistic
device noise.


**What it does establish.** The experiment demonstrates:


1. The branch-transfer circuit primitive behaves consistently with unitary predictions within
device noise on IBM Quantum hardware.


7


(a) Ideal baseline. (b) Noisy (backend-matched) baseline.


Figure 3: Dephasing-channel forecast for the branch-transfer circuit under (a) ideal and (b)
backend-matched noisy conditions.


2. Coherence witnesses _WX_ and _WY_ provide off-diagonal sensitivity complementary to populationbased visibility.


3. A methodology exists for constraining specific nonunitary channel families relative to hardware noise floors.


**When could this become interpretation-relevant?**


In principle, if future experiments observed statistically robust deviations from unitary predictions
that persisted across:


  - multiple hardware backends with independent calibration,


  - different transpilation and error-mitigation strategies,


  - exhaustive exclusion of hardware artifacts (crosstalk, leakage, calibration drift, coherent errors),


  - systematic variation of circuit parameters,


and if such deviations matched the signature of a specific nonunitary model while being inconsistent with any plausible noise mechanism, this could constitute evidence relevant to interpretation
debates. The present work does not observe any such deviation; it establishes baseline methodology
for potential future investigations.

### **7 Conclusions and Future Work**


We have presented a reproducible IBM-hardware execution of inter-branch communication circuit
primitives with coherence-witness diagnostics, backend-matched noise modeling, and a nonunitary

8


channel constraint pipeline. The experiment establishes baseline measurements and methodology
without claiming interpretation-level conclusions.


**Outlook.** This work serves as a proof-of-concept demonstration on superconducting qubits. Ongoing follow-up studies aim to replicate the same inter-branch message-transfer primitive across multiple quantum computing modalities—gate-model superconducting and ion-trap devices, neutralatom analog platforms, photonics, and annealing-style hardware—varying connectivity and compilation constraints while preserving identical logical structure. The goal is to quantify a crossmodality “compilation tax” (e.g., depth/2Q-gate overhead and fidelity loss relative to an ideal
logical circuit) and develop a generalized connectivity scaling law for realizing inter-branch communication primitives under realistic hardware constraints.


**Future directions aligned with Violaris’ complexity axis.** Violaris [6] discusses how protocol complexity scales with branch divergence. Natural extensions include:


 - **Branch divergence scaling:** Represent friend-0 and friend-1 states as _k_ -qubit bitstrings
whose Hamming distance grows under branch evolution. The branch-swap operation then
becomes a longer _X_ -string (product of _X_ gates), yielding a complexity-vs-coherence scaling
benchmark.


 - **Multi-backend replication:** Execute on multiple IBM Quantum backends and other platforms to assess reproducibility and identify backend-specific artifacts.


 - **Calibration-synchronized repeats:** Run experiments immediately after fresh calibration
cycles to minimize drift effects.


 - **Error mitigation:** Apply randomized compiling, Pauli twirling, or zero-noise extrapolation
(ZNE) to witness observables, enabling tighter constraints on nonunitary channels.
