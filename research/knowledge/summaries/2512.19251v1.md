**ABSTRACT**


Decentralized finance (DeFi) lacks centralized oversight, often resulting in heightened volatility. In


contrast, centralized finance (CeFi) offers a more stable environment with institutional safeguards.


Institutional backing can play a stabilizing role in a hybrid structure (HyFi), enhancing transparency,


governance, and market discipline. This study investigates whether HyFi-like cryptocurrencies, those


backed by institutions, exhibit lower price risk than fully decentralized counterparts.


Using daily data for 18 major cryptocurrencies from January 2020 to November 2024, we estimate panel


EGLS models with fixed, random, and dynamic specifications. Results show that HyFi-like assets


consistently experience lower price risk, with this effect intensifying during periods of elevated market


volatility. The negative interaction between HyFi status and market-wide volatility confirms their


stabilizing role.


Conversely, greater decentralization is strongly associated with increased volatility, particularly during


periods of market stress. Robustness checks using quantile regressions and pre-/post-Terra Luna


subsamples reinforce these findings, with stronger effects observed in high-volatility quantiles and post

crisis conditions. These results highlight the importance of institutional architecture in enhancing the


resilience of digital asset markets.

**1.** **INTRODUCTION**


The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced unprecedented innovation into global financial


systems, offering transparent, peer-to-peer alternatives to traditional intermediaries. However, this


innovation is accompanied by extreme volatility due to a lack of centralized governance and regulatory


oversight (Chen & Bellavitis, 2020; Jensen et al., 2021). Cryptocurrencies remain notoriously volatile,


nearly five times that of the S&P 500 (Yae & Tian, 2024). The volatility of Bitcoin prices is almost ten


times higher than the volatility of major exchange rates (Baur & Dimpfl, 2021). This level of fluctuation


challenges the integration of digital assets into broader financial infrastructure and undermines their


potential as reliable stores of value or mediums of exchange.


Price movements are often driven by speculation, social media sentiment, or technical vulnerabilities


rather than fundamentals (Sovbetov, 2018; Flori, 2019; Shen et al., 2019; Caferra, 2020; Gupta et al.,


2020; Kumar et al., 2021). As DeFi grows in market capitalization and systemic relevance, surpassing


$2.6 trillion at its peak in 2021 (Huang et al., 2022), its susceptibility to destabilizing shocks raises urgent


questions for financial stability. Amid this, a hybrid approach that blends DeFi’s innovation with the


credibility and discipline of centralized finance (CeFi) has begun to attract interest. We refer to this


emerging model as Hybrid Finance (HyFi).


HyFi posits that the presence of institutional actors (e.g., ETFs, custody banks, regulatory oversight) can


signal price reliability, dampening speculation-driven swings and improving market efficiency. Chen et al.


(2020) show that institutional investors, especially hedge funds, play a stabilizing role in opaque


environments. By substituting for public information providers, institutions enhance price discovery and


mitigate mispricing, particularly when market transparency is low.


Institutionally backed crypto assets are more likely to be researched, monitored, and traded by


informed investors, leading to more accurate prices and lower volatility (Chen et al., 2020). In the


context, tokens with stronger institutional engagement may exhibit lower volatility due to better


information flows, surveillance, and risk management (DeVault et al., 2025).


Recent empirical evidence confirms the increasing footprint of institutions in the crypto space. The


number of financial institutions holding crypto assets quadrupled from 200 in 2020 to over 846 by 2022


(Huang et al., 2022)(Figure 1). These holdings are concentrated on a small number of highly capitalized


assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Binance Coin (BNB) that enjoy better


infrastructure, custody solutions, and integration with traditional finance. EY-Parthenon and Coinbase


(2025) further reveal that 87% of institutions now hold spot crypto or ETFs (up from 76% in 2024) with


BTC (97%), ETH (86%), and XRP (34%) dominating institutional portfolios (see Table 1). These tokens


serve as de facto HyFi proxies, characterized by structured governance, public recognition, and deeper


integration with traditional finance.

**Rationale of Institutional Backing**


Widely adopted as a digital store of value; held by major ETFs (e.g., BlackRock,
Fidelity); deeply integrated into traditional finance via custody services,
derivatives, and spot ETFs; highest institutional penetration.


Foundation of DeFi applications; enables tokenization and smart contracts;
supported by CME futures, ETPs, and institutional staking products; secondmost held by institutions.


Tailored for cross-border payments; supported by Ripple Labs with strong
banking partnerships; used in enterprise finance; regulatory scrutiny (e.g., SEC
litigation) enhanced institutional visibility.


Core asset of the Binance ecosystem; used for trading fees, token sales, and
platform services; supported by institutional custodians (e.g., Fireblocks);
centralized governance and CeFi–DeFi integration position it as a HyFi bridge.

Despite this momentum, concerns persist. EY-Parthenon and Coinbase (2025) cite an uncertain

adoption (see Figure 2). Meanwhile, among those not yet invested in crypto, lack of valuation


fundamentals and fear of financial crimes remain dominant concerns. Notably, 57% of institutions


identify regulatory clarity as the key catalyst for future digital asset growth, followed closely by greater


institutional adoption. This suggests that trust, structure, and oversight, not decentralization alone, are


essential for mainstream integration.


**Figure 2.** Top concerns of institutions investing in crypto assets


**Source:** EY-Parthenon and Coinbase (2025)


Yet, academic research has been slow to empirically evaluate the stabilizing effects of institutional


engagement. Most DeFi studies focus on protocol design, governance, or security (Engle et al., 2024;


Umar, 2025), but rarely assess how hybrid structures affect market dynamics. The literature on volatility


in crypto markets often treats decentralization and institutional presence in isolation (DeVault et al.,


2025) rather than in interaction. Our study fills this gap by asking: Do institutionally backed, HyFi-like


cryptocurrencies exhibit lower price volatility compared to purely decentralized tokens?


To address this, we construct an empirical framework that incorporates institutional presence, asset

specific factors (decentralization, liquidity, market capitalization), and broader market conditions


(volatility, shocks). We focus on whether institutional support dampens volatility directly and whether it


moderates crypto assets' response to external shocks. Our study contributes to the growing body of


work at the intersection of financial innovation and systemic risk, offering new insights into how hybrid


models can promote resilience in the evolving digital asset landscape.


**2.** **Literature Review and Theoretical Foundations**


Institutional engagement with digital assets has accelerated in both academia and practice. EY

Parthenon and Coinbase (2025) report that 83% of institutional investors express interest in digital


assets provided by regulated financial firms, emphasizing that interoperability between private and


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


public blockchains is a prerequisite for broader institutional adoption. HyFi-like models synthesize these


strands by embedding CeFi accountability, disclosure, custody, and risk controls within programmable


smart-contract environments to achieve trust, transparency, and resilience.


The growing involvement of centralized financial institutions reinforces this shift toward hybridization.


Feldman (2024) documents that more than 65% of major banks in the United States and Europe engage


in cryptocurrency-related initiatives, including investment and infrastructure development around


Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Binance Coin (BNB). Large institutions such as


BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and BNY Mellon have made substantial financial


commitments to these assets and to adjacent services (Andrew, 2024). Public authorities in several


jurisdictions have also taken custody of sizeable seized digital-asset holdings, signaling a growing

institutional footprint [1] . The United States, China, and the United Kingdom hold significant Bitcoin


reserves, underlining an emerging consensus around specific cryptocurrencies as credible stores of


value. These developments motivate the working classification of BTC, ETH, XRP, and BNB as HyFi-like


assets that are partially embedded in institutional finance and benefit from monitoring, capital


commitment, and reputational filtering that are typically absent in purely DeFi tokens.


**2.1. Conceptual Framework: HyFi as an Interoperability Layer**


HyFi is best understood as an interoperability layer that connects the institutional infrastructure of CeFi


with the programmability and composability of DeFi. On the CeFi side, regulated entities contribute


custody, disclosure, compliance, balance-sheet capital, and reputational screening that raise monitoring


quality and create avenues for recourse. On the DeFi side, permissionless smart contracts, automated


market making, and modular protocols enable rapid innovation, continuous markets, and efficient


settlement. HyFi binds these domains by admitting institutional participation into programmable


environments while preserving transparent on-chain execution. Enrollment occurs once through a


Digital Universal ID that issues a credential using zero-knowledge proofs; subsequent transactions


submit proofs that are verified by a smart-contract verifier, so execution and settlement are non

intermediated after enrollment.


Two mechanisms link this architecture to lower price risk. A signaling channel operates when credible


institutional engagement conveys quality and survival prospects to less informed participants, narrowing


belief dispersion and reducing the speculative component of order flow. A transaction-cost channel


operates when standardized access, custody, audits, and recourse compress search, verification, and


enforcement frictions. When these frictions fall, participation widens, liquidity deepens, effective


spreads narrow, and price discovery becomes less sensitive to transient order imbalances, which jointly


dampens realized volatility. These effects should be strongest when aggregate uncertainty is high, which


motivates the interaction between HyFi status and market volatility in Equation (1). This framework


1 [https://bitcointreasuries.net](https://bitcointreasuries.net/)


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


maps directly to our empirical design: HyFi-like status captures institutional embeddedness at the asset


level; market volatility provides the state variable that governs the strength of both mechanisms;


decentralization, liquidity, and size enter as structural controls to avoid confounding institutional


embeddedness with network concentration, market depth, or scale.


The diagram in Figure 3 arrays CeFi, HyFi, and DeFi in three columns across the core dimensions


(governance, privacy and identity, accessibility, visibility and records, credibility, oversight and recourse,


efficiency). For each row, arrows from the CeFi and DeFi cells converge on the corresponding HyFi cell


(H1–H7). Color coding indicates HyFi uptake: green denotes full incorporation, gray denotes partial


incorporation, and red denotes no incorporation. Beneath each row, two mechanism callouts identify


whether that component acts primarily through Signaling Theory (credibility and information effects) or


Transaction Cost Theory (reductions in search, verification, monitoring, enforcement, coordination, or


settlement costs). The vertical flow terminates in the Outcomes panel, which summarizes the expected


effects of HyFi: lower realized volatility and risk, deeper liquidity with narrower spreads, more


informative prices, efficient on-chain settlement at lower cost, privacy-preserving compliance, wider


institutional participation, and defined oversight with partial recourse.


The conceptual framework is compatible with a concrete architectural instantiation that preserves


DeFi’s innovation while addressing security, oversight, and governance shortcomings. At its core is a


layer-two Digital Universal ID sidechain governed by a Global DAO composed of trusted supranational


institutions. Users register identities through a one-time process that generates zero-knowledge proofs;


the credential is later verified on the chain at execution, which maintains anonymity while enforcing


compliance. By embedding this privacy-preserving identity structure into a smart-contract layer, the


HyFi framework enhances security, accountability, and investor protection. The model mitigates risks


such as fraud, misuse, and lack of recourse, and it provides a foundation for legally compliant financial


products and services. In doing so, HyFi bridges the trust gap that limits DeFi’s mainstream adoption and


promotes inclusion and stability within a decentralized yet governed digital ecosystem.

**2.2. Signaling in Markets with Information Asymmetry**


The stabilizing role of institutional backing can be grounded in Signaling Theory, as in Spence (1973). In


settings with information asymmetry, institutional investors acting as informed agents signal asset


quality, credibility, and risk management practices to less informed market participants. The presence of


regulated funds, publicly listed firms, or established financial institutions in a cryptocurrency’s


ecosystem sends a trust signal that reduces perceived uncertainty. This signal encourages broader


participation, improves price discovery, and dampens speculative volatility, particularly in DeFi markets


that, while transparent on chain, remain functionally opaque and fragmented because of concentrated


governance, pseudonymous participation, and dispersion of liquidity across protocols and chains. These


features, coupled with off-chain sentiment and coordination that amplify information asymmetry, are


documented in recent work such as Aramonte et al. (2021), Hamrick et al. (2021), and Kim and Kauffman


(2024). In this context, HyFi-like cryptocurrencies serve as vehicles of informational clarity, where


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


institutional engagement substitutes for absent regulatory and disclosure norms, aligns expectations,


and enhances systemic stability.


**2.3. Transaction-Cost Economics and Hybrid Intermediation**


The stabilizing role of institutional backing is also consistent with Transaction Cost Theory, which


predicts that intermediating structures emerge to economize on search, monitoring, and enforcement


costs when markets are fragmented and counterparties are opaque (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 2025). In


the context of digital assets, HyFi reduces onboarding and discovery costs through standardized access


and routing, lowers verification and monitoring costs through privacy-preserving identity, custody,


audits, and disclosure, and improves enforcement through programmable compliance and defined


avenues for recourse. Compressing these frictions weakens adverse selection, broadens participation,


and moderates the volatility of price discovery, with effects that are most pronounced when aggregate

uncertainty is high, which motivates the 𝐻𝑦𝐹𝑖𝑖 × 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑡 term in Equation (1). For an

accessible synthesis, see Williamson (2025).


**2.4. Empirical Implications and Positioning**


Evidence from centralized markets complements this argument. Chen et al. (2020) show that when


public information deteriorates, hedge funds step in, acquire additional private information, trade more


aggressively, and restore market efficiency. Their findings imply that sophisticated investors reduce


price risk and information asymmetries, particularly in opaque markets. When institutional participation


increases, the adverse effects of diminished public information become statistically insignificant. This


substitution effect aligns with microstructure perspectives that link trusted oversight to lower volatility


through reduced moral hazard and narrower information gaps, consistent with Goldstein and Yang


(2019). In digital assets, this indicates that HyFi-like assets should command lower price risk relative to


purely decentralized tokens.


The relevance of this mechanism is heightened by the volatile and off-chain opaque nature of DeFi

markets. Reports from the DeFi Rekt database [2] cite cumulative losses exceeding $88 billion arising from


speculative trading, smart-contract vulnerabilities, rug pulls, and inadequate oversight. High-profile


failures such as the TerraUSD collapse and the Poly Network hack illustrate systemic risks in the absence


of enforceable recourse. Zetzsche et al. (2020) warn that a trust-in-code paradigm lacks legal


enforceability and leaves users exposed to irrecoverable losses. CeFi incorporates compliance, risk


management, and investor protection, and HyFi can replicate these safeguards on-chain through


programmable rules and identity.

Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


Our contribution is to move beyond a homogeneous treatment of cryptocurrencies by classifying assets


according to their degree of institutional embeddedness and testing whether institutional support,


defined as HyFi-like status, systematically reduces price volatility. The empirical strategy controls


structural factors such as decentralization, liquidity, and market capitalization. The central prediction is


that the interaction between HyFi status and market volatility is negative, consistent with signaling and


transaction-cost mechanisms operating more strongly in high-uncertainty states. Such a shift has the


potential to expand institutional adoption globally (Conlon et al., 2024). From a risk-pricing perspective,


assets with stronger governance should possess a risk premium advantage because the presence of


trusted institutions is associated with lower idiosyncratic risk (Duppati et al., 2023). By analogy, HyFi-like


cryptocurrencies fall under the oversight of public companies, regulated funds, or consortium banks,


which mitigates opportunistic behavior and technical fragility. This perspective parallels agency theory


and financial risk theory, where trusted oversight reduces information asymmetries and moral hazard,

thereby lowering perceived volatility (De Filippi and Hassan, 2016). KPMG [3] notes that cryptoassets


_“present fundamentally new risks”_ but also new opportunities to build automated risk controls, and


banks entering crypto must _“integrate existing industry frameworks”_ . Our classification of assets that


straddle DeFi innovation and CeFi safeguards operationalizes these insights.


Crucially, there is limited academic literature on the hybridization of DeFi with CeFi frameworks. While a


few studies propose partial forms of integration, such as hybrid credit scoring protocols that combine


off-chain data (e.g., credit reports, social media) with on-chain behavior, these efforts remain narrowly


focused and raise unresolved regulatory and privacy concerns (Packin & Lev-Aretz, 2024). Most existing


research continues to treat cryptocurrencies as a homogeneous asset class and emphasizes


macroeconomic or sentiment-driven factors (Sovbetov, 2018; Flori, 2019; Shen et al., 2019; Shen & Wu,


2025), without differentiating tokens based on institutional structure. We address this gap by


disaggregating cryptocurrencies according to their degree of institutional embeddedness and empirically


evaluating whether institutional support, defined as HyFi-like status, systematically reduces price


volatility. Our analysis controls key structural factors such as decentralization, liquidity, and market


capitalization. By assessing the stabilizing potential of HyFi-like assets, we offer actionable insights for


regulators and investors seeking to integrate digital assets into the broader financial system in a safer


and more resilient manner.


**3.** **Data & Methodology**


**3.1.Data & Sample**


We classify Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Binance Coin (BNB) as proxies for HyFi-like


digital assets due to their substantial adoption by institutional investors, as discussed in the preceding


conceptual section. Notably, BNB operates as a utility token within Binance’s centralized ecosystem

while remaining tradable across decentralized networks, making it an archetype of the HyFi structure.


These cryptocurrencies have achieved significant recognition and institutional uptake. They embody the


core attributes of the HyFi model, namely the integration of decentralized infrastructure with elements


of regulatory oversight, institutional trust, and enhanced market stability.


In addition, the study incorporates a balanced sample of other cryptocurrencies that span the major


functional categories of the crypto ecosystem:


  - **Centralized Exchange Tokens (CEXs):** Cronos (CRO) and OKB.

  - **Decentralized Exchange Tokens (DEXs):** Stellar (XLM), Uniswap (UNI), ThorChain (RUNE),


Raydium (RAY), Synthetix (SNX), and Gnosis (GNO).

  - **Pure DeFi Platforms:** Avalanche (AVAX), ChainLink (LINK), Fantom (FTM), and Polkadot (DOT).

  - **Traditional Layer-1 Tokens:** Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), which are integral to the broader


cryptocurrency ecosystem.


The selection of these cryptocurrencies is guided by the following criteria:


  - **Market Significance:** Inclusion among the top 150 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization
during the sampling period, ensuring liquidity and relevance.

  - **Functional Diversity:** Purposeful selection across CEX, DEX, DeFi, and traditional chains to
capture a wide spectrum of governance and design structures.

  - **Institutional Relevance (for HyFi-like assets only):** HyFi proxies are selected based on evidence
of institutional participation, regulatory integration, and centralized infrastructure support—
characteristics essential to capturing hybrid financial dynamics.

  - **Data Availability and Quality:** Daily data availability for open, close, high, low prices, and
volume over at least 1,000 trading days to ensure consistency in volatility and risk analysis.

  - **Exclusion of Stablecoins and Meme/Fun Coins:** Stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) are excluded due
to their fixed pegs, which make them unsuitable for volatility modeling. Similarly, meme-based
or entertainment tokens (e.g., DOGE, SHIB) are excluded due to their speculative and often nonfundamental nature, which introduces bias and noise into risk estimations.


This sampling strategy avoids over-representation of speculative assets while ensuring analytical validity
across different types of digital assets. We compile daily data (open, high, low, close, trading volume,
market capitalization) for 18 major cryptocurrencies from January 1, 2020, through November 24, 2024.
Price and market information are obtained from CoinMarketCap [4], which aggregates exchange data
worldwide.

**3.2.** **Econometric Setup**


The structure of our dataset, which consists of multiple cryptocurrencies (cross-sectional units) observed


across time, makes panel data models particularly suitable for empirical analysis. To control unobserved


heterogeneity across cryptocurrencies, such as differences in technological maturity, governance

structure, or market exposure, the study employs panel Estimated Generalized Least Squares (EGLS) [5]


models under both fixed-effects and random-effects specifications. Diagnostic tests indicate significant


heteroskedasticity across units (Breusch–Pagan test, p<0.01), serial correlation within units (Breusch–


Godfrey test, p<0.01), and cross-sectional dependence (Pesaran CD test, p<0.01). Given these non

spherical error structures, EGLS provides more efficient and consistent estimates by allowing unit

specific error variances, AR(1) disturbances within units, and contemporaneous correlation across units.


As robustness, fixed-effects estimates with Driscoll–Kraay standard errors and Common Correlated


5 Estimation is conducted using EGLS, which generalizes the classical panel regression framework by adjusting for
heteroskedasticity and potential cross-sectional correlation.


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


Effects (CCE) models yield qualitatively similar signs and significance, confirming that inference does not


hinge on the EGLS specification.


This study investigates whether institutional support, proxied by HyFi-like status, reduces the price risk


of cryptocurrencies. The baseline specification is given as:


𝑛



𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽1𝐻𝑦𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽2(𝐻𝑦𝐹𝑖𝑖 × 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑡) + ∑𝜃𝑗𝑋𝑗𝑖𝑡

𝑗=1



+ 𝜖𝑖𝑡              (1)



where 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑡 denotes the price risk of cryptocurrency _i_ at time _t_, measured using the Parkinson (1980)

volatility estimator. The variable 𝐻𝑦𝐹𝑖𝑖 is the binary indicator that equals 1 for cryptocurrencies

classified as HyFi-like and 0 otherwise. The term 𝛼𝑖 captures unobserved individual effects:


  - In the Fixed Effects (FE) model, 𝛼𝑖 is treated as a fixed constant for each cryptocurrency,

controlling for time-invariant heterogeneity.

  - In the Random Effects (RE) model, 𝛼𝑖~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑎 [2] ) is treated as a random variable uncorrelated

with the regressors.


The vector 𝑋𝑖𝑡 includes control variables that reflect liquidity, size, investor attention, market conditions,

decentralization, and exogenous shocks.


To account for liquidity frictions, the model includes the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, calculated as
the absolute value of daily returns divided by trading volume:



𝐴𝑚𝑖ℎ𝑢𝑑𝑖𝑡 =



|𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑡|
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑡



This measure captures the price impact of trading and reflects constraints in liquidity, which can amplify
volatility, particularly in thin markets. To enhance interpretability and address scaling issues arising from
extremely large trading volumes in the crypto space, the Amihud measure is standardized as a z-score:

𝑍_𝐴𝑚𝑖ℎ𝑢𝑑𝑖𝑡 = [𝐴𝑚𝑖ℎ𝑢𝑑] 𝜎𝑖,𝐴𝑚𝑖ℎ𝑢𝑑 [𝑖𝑡] [−𝜇][𝑖,𝐴𝑚𝑖ℎ𝑢𝑑]


This transformation ensures that the coefficient reflects the effect of a one-standard-deviation change in
illiquidity on price risk.


Cryptocurrency size is captured by the change in the natural logarithm of market capitalization. Investor


attention and asset attractiveness are proxied by the logarithm of Google search volume for each

cryptocurrency [6] . General market volatility is measured using the realized volatility of a Crypto-50 index,


which is constructed following Sovbetov (2018). The index is used to calculate market-wide volatility as:

𝑅𝑉𝑡 = √𝐿−1 [∑(𝑟][𝑡−𝑘] [−𝑟̅][𝑡][)][2]



𝑘=0



where 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑙𝑛(𝑃𝑡⁄𝑃𝑡−1) denotes the daily log return of the top 50 crypto index, and 𝑅𝑉𝑡 is calculated as

the rolling standard deviation over the past 30 days (with 𝐿= 30 ).


To control exogenous market disruptions, the model includes market shock data, represented by the

logarithm of funds lost in fraud or scam events, based on the DeFi Rekt database [7] .


A central and novel feature of this study is the inclusion of a Decentralization Index, which captures the


structural governance characteristics of each cryptocurrency. Unlike prior literature that typically


ignores decentralization in empirical models, we incorporate this index to test whether governance


dispersion affects price stability. The index is constructed as an equal-weighted average of five Gini


coefficients that measure decentralization across distinct domains: (i) network power or stake


distribution, (ii) wealth distribution among token holders, (iii) geographical dispersion of validating


nodes, (iv) concentration of code contributions on GitHub, and (v) regional distribution of information


flow, proxied by tweets.


The dependent variable, price risk, is measured using Parkinson's (1980) volatility estimator, which


captures the intraday price range, offering a more information-rich alternative to traditional close-to

close volatility measures. It is calculated as:



𝜎𝑃,𝑖𝑡 = [𝐻][𝑖𝑡] [−𝐿][𝑖𝑡]

𝐶𝑖𝑡√2𝐿𝑛2



~~)~~



where 𝐻𝑖𝑡, 𝐿𝑖𝑡, and 𝐶𝑖𝑡 represent the high, low, and closing prices of asset _i_ at time _t_, respectively.


Equation (1) is estimated using both fixed-effects and random-effects panel data models. However,


since the fixed-effects estimator may suffer from perfect collinearity when including a time-invariant

dummy variable like 𝐻𝑦𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑡, the analysis incorporates an interaction term between the HyFi dummy and

market volatility in the fixed-effects specification. This interaction term allows for a more precise


examination of how HyFi-like cryptocurrencies behave under varying volatility regimes and isolates their


stabilizing role more effectively.


To ensure the robustness of the estimated relationship between institutional support and


cryptocurrency price risk, we conduct a series of complementary checks. First, we introduce a lagged


dependent variable into the panel fixed-effects specification to account for potential dynamic


persistence in volatility. Given the large time dimension of the dataset (T = 1790), the inclusion of a lag


7 [https://de.fi/rekt-database](https://de.fi/rekt-database)


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


term does not raise concerns of Nickell bias and allows for a more flexible representation of short-term

risk dynamics [8] .


Second, we apply quantile regressions, including Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) at the 10 [th], 25 [th], 50 [th]

(median), 75 [th], and 90 [th] percentiles of the price risk distribution. This approach enables us to examine


whether the stabilizing effect of HyFi-like status varies across different volatility regimes and offers


robustness to outliers and non-normal distributions often observed in crypto markets.

where 𝑄𝑇(𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑡|𝑋𝑖𝑡) denotes the conditional 𝜏 -th quantile ( 𝜏 = 0.10,0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90 ) of price risk,

and the coefficients 𝛽1,𝜏, 𝛽2,𝜏, and 𝜃𝑗,𝜏 capture the marginal effects at each quantile. Estimation is

performed using the Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) method, which is equivalent to median regression

when 𝜏 = 0.50 . The coefficient 𝛽1,𝜏 and 𝛽2,𝜏 should bring consistent results with equation 1.


Third, we split the sample around the Terra Luna collapse on 7 [th] May 2022, a major shock to


decentralized finance ecosystems, and re-estimate the model separately for the pre-crash and post

crash periods. This allows us to assess whether the role of institutional backing differs in relatively stable


versus turbulent market environments. Collectively, these robustness checks reinforce the validity of the


main findings by accounting for temporal dynamics, distributional asymmetries, and structural breaks.


**3.3.Decentralization Index**


Mainstream literature on decentralization metrics predominantly employs measures such as the


Nakamoto coefficient, Shannon entropy, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI), and the Gini coefficient


of power (stakes) (Srinivasan & Lee, 2017; Gencer et al., 2018; Kwon et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2021). While


these metrics provide valuable insights, they often focus on single-dimensional aspects of


decentralization, potentially overlooking the complex, multifaceted nature of decentralization in


blockchain and distributed systems.


To address this limitation, we propose a more comprehensive, multidimensional framework that


captures various aspects of decentralization, including network decentralization, wealth


decentralization, node decentralization, code decentralization, and information decentralization. This


approach is crucial to avoid oversimplifying decentralization and to better account for the diverse layers


of decentralization that underpin blockchain systems.


To compute the decentralization index, we use the Gini coefficient, a widely recognized method for


measuring inequality, applied across different dimensions of decentralization:


8 Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators are primarily designed for panels with large cross-sectional
units (N) and short time dimensions (T). In settings with large T and small N, as in this study, GMM may be
inappropriate due to weak instrument problems and overfitting risk.


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


  - **Network decentralization:** This dimension assesses the distribution of power or stakes among


validators within the blockchain network. While the Nakamoto coefficient is effective at


determining the minimum number of validators required to control 51% of the network, it does


not provide insight into how evenly the power is distributed across validators. To address this,


we use the Gini coefficient to measure the extent to which power is distributed along a scale


from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a higher concentration of power.

  - **Wealth decentralization:** This dimension measures the distribution of wealth among token


holders. The Gini coefficient is applied to assess how evenly the ownership of tokens is


distributed across individuals within the ecosystem.

  - **Node decentralization:** This dimension evaluates the distribution of nodes across different


geographical regions. Using the Gini coefficient, we analyze the concentration of nodes to


determine the extent of decentralization in terms of network infrastructure.

  - **Code decentralization:** Code decentralization is measured by the distribution of contributions to


the project's codebase. The Gini coefficient is applied to GitHub commits to assess the degree of


decentralization in terms of development efforts across contributors.

  - **Information decentralization:** This dimension measures the distribution of information flow


within the community, as captured by the geographical distribution of tweets related to the


cryptocurrency. The Gini coefficient is used to analyze the concentration of information within


specific regions.


By combining these multiple dimensions, we construct a multidimensional decentralization index, which


reflects the overall decentralization of a cryptocurrency network. This approach provides a more


nuanced understanding of decentralization, capturing not only the distribution of power but also the


broader ecosystem dynamics that influence the functioning of decentralized networks.


The decentralization coefficients for the sampled cryptocurrencies are summarized in Table 4.

**3.4. Data Description and Preliminary Checks**


To ensure the validity of our panel estimation strategy, we begin by conducting a series of preliminary


diagnostics on the structure and properties of the dataset. Given the panel configuration of 18


cryptocurrencies observed daily over a multi-year period, we first assess the presence of cross-sectional


dependence, a common feature in financial data where shocks or volatility in one asset may transmit to


others. Results from multiple diagnostic tests, including the Breusch-Pagan LM test, Pesaran Scaled LM


test, Bias-Corrected LM test, and the Pesaran CD test, consistently reject the null of cross-sectional


independence. These findings confirm significant interdependencies across cryptocurrencies, likely


reflecting common exposures to macroeconomic conditions, investor sentiment, or systemic events.

**Note:** For cryptocurrency-specific variables, we use Pesaran’s CIPS test with a deterministic constant and ADF lags


selected by AIC (max lag = 4) to account for cross-sectional dependence. For market-wide variables, cross

sectionally independent ADF tests are applied under the same lag and constant specifications. The null hypothesis


assumes a unit root. The ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.


To account for this cross-sectional dependence in the analysis of stationarity, we employ the Cross

Sectionally Augmented Im, Pesaran, and Shin (CIPS) unit root test. The CIPS test, which aggregates


Cross-Sectionally Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) statistics across units, is designed to provide reliable


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


inference in panels with correlated residuals. The results, reported in Table 5, indicate that all key


cryptocurrency-specific variables are stationary at conventional levels of significance. For broader


market-level variables such as aggregate volatility and market shocks, which are common across all


units, we apply cross-sectionally independent ADF unit root tests. These tests also confirm stationarity,


suggesting that no further transformation or differencing of variables is necessary prior to model


estimation.


Given the multi-dimensional nature of our independent variables, we examine the potential for


multicollinearity using centered Pearson correlation coefficients. While most variables display moderate


or low intercorrelation, a notably high association emerges between the decentralization index and log


market capitalization, indicating that more centralized tokens tend to attain higher valuations. To


mitigate this concern and preserve the conceptual distinctiveness of decentralization, we orthogonalize


the decentralization coefficient by regressing it on log market capitalization and extract the residuals,


which serve as a _“purified”_ decentralization measure for use in all subsequent regressions. This


adjustment isolates the independent variation in decentralization, free from confounding size effects.


Table 6 presents the centered correlation matrix for the explanatory variables. Illiquidity, market


volatility, and market shocks are moderately correlated with one another, reflecting overlapping market


dynamics. However, no pair of variables exceeds a correlation threshold that would suggest problematic


multicollinearity.

Descriptive statistics for all variables used in the estimation are provided in Table 7. The average daily


price risk, measured via Parkinson’s volatility estimator, is 0.063 with a high degree of skewness and


kurtosis, indicating the presence of extreme values and fat tails, which are typical in cryptocurrency


markets. Illiquidity, expressed as a standardized Amihud measure, is centered around zero by


construction but displays significant variation, especially among less liquid tokens. Size dynamics,


proxied by the first difference of log market capitalization, show a mean close to zero, capturing daily


percentage changes in token size. The distribution is notably skewed and leptokurtic, reflecting large


swings in capitalization during volatile periods. Attractiveness exhibits wide dispersion across


cryptocurrencies, with several tokens displaying outlier behavior. The decentralization index ranges


from 0.52 to 0.86, highlighting considerable variation in governance and structural openness across the

This section reports the panel EGLS estimates and robustness checks that test whether HyFi-like

risk than purely decentralized tokens. Table 9 summarizes results for random-effects (RE) and fixed

effects (FE) specifications, including dynamic variants with a lagged dependent variable to capture


persistence in price risk.


Across all specifications, the intercept is positive and highly significant, indicating a baseline level of


volatility. Intercepts are modestly lower under FE, which suggests that time-invariant asset


heterogeneity absorbs part of this baseline. The Hausman test does not reject the null in the static RE


model, which supports the efficiency of RE relative to FE. In the dynamic setting, the Hausman test


strongly rejects the null, indicating correlation between regressors and unobserved effects and


validating the use of FE in the dynamic specification.


The HyFi-like indicator is negatively associated with price risk in RE and dynamic specifications,


consistent with the idea that institutional backing and structured governance reduce information


asymmetry and improve monitoring (Chen et al., 2020). Point estimates are economically small but


precise, around −0.0091 to −0.0102. Crucially, the FE interaction confirms that HyFi-like assets are


substantially less exposed to market-wide turbulence. The coefficient on HyFi × Market Volatility is


−0.3422 (p<0.01). This means that for a one-unit increase in standardized market volatility, the increase


in price risk is 0.3422 smaller for HyFi-like assets than for non-HyFi assets. In the dynamic FE model, the

long-run attenuation equals 𝛽𝐼𝑁𝑇/(1 −𝜙) ≈−0.392 given 𝜙= 0.2918 . With standardized volatility,

implied short-run slopes are 0.3728 for non-HyFi and 0.0950 for HyFi, and long-run slopes are about


0.526 for non-HyFi and 0.134 for HyFi, which indicates a pronounced flattening rather than a reversal of


the volatility–risk relationship. Figure 4 visualizes these patterns, and Figure 5 summarizes the


corresponding slopes with approximate confidence intervals.

The decentralization index exerts a consistently positive and significant effect on price risk across all


model variants. A one-unit increase in decentralization is associated with an increase of 0.02 to 0.08


units in price risk, depending on the model. This implies that greater decentralization is associated with


increased price volatility. While decentralization is often viewed as a foundational value of blockchain


systems, these findings suggest that the lack of centralized oversight may come at a cost in terms of


price stability. The results challenge the assumption that decentralization inherently stabilizes markets,


instead highlighting its potential fragility. While decentralization enhances censorship resistance and


democratic participation, it may also introduce operational inefficiencies and regulatory uncertainty that


amplify price fluctuations. The significance and consistency of the decentralization coefficient indicate


that governance structure is not a peripheral attribute; it plays a central role in shaping investor


expectations and market behavior. This insight is particularly important as regulators and developers


weigh trade-offs between decentralization and system stability in the design of next-generation crypto


infrastructure.


Attractiveness, proxied by search interest, is positively and significantly associated with price risk.


Although the coefficient magnitude is modest (0.0004 to 0.0019), the statistical consistency across


models underscores the role of investor attention in amplifying short-term volatility.


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


The effect of size, measured as a log change in market capitalization, is negative and significant


throughout. Coefficients range between -0.11 and -0.13, indicating that larger cryptocurrencies


experience lower price risk, likely due to their greater liquidity depth, broader adoption, and reduced


sensitivity to speculative pressure. In practical terms, a 1-unit increase in log market capitalization


lowers daily price risk by over 0.10 units.


Illiquidity, measured via the standardized Amihud indicator, has a positive and statistically significant


effect on price risk in all specifications, with coefficients in the range of 0.03 to 0.035. This aligns with


the theoretical expectation that price impact is more pronounced in less liquid tokens, contributing to


higher volatility.


Among all covariates, market volatility emerges as the strongest predictor of price risk. Its large and


significant coefficients, ranging from 0.31 to 0.48, reflect the endogenous transmission of systemic


volatility to individual tokens. Market shocks, measured by the log of scam-related fund losses, are


significant only in the dynamic models, suggesting that exogenous disruptions exert delayed effects on


volatility.

coefficients is not accounted for.


**4.2. Robustness Checks**


To reinforce these findings, we estimate quantile regressions at multiple levels of the price risk
distribution (Table 10). Results reveal notable heterogeneity across quantiles. The effects of
decentralization, illiquidity, market volatility, and HyFi status intensify in magnitude as one moves
toward higher quantiles, indicating their increasing relevance during extreme volatility episodes. For
instance, the HyFi dummy coefficient increases (in absolute value) from -0.0074 at the 10 [th] percentile to
-0.0167 at the 90 [th] percentile. This pattern indicates that institutional features not only reduce average
volatility but also play a critical role in mitigating tail risks. HyFi-like tokens appear to serve as anchors of
relative stability, particularly during stress events that affect the broader crypto ecosystem. The results
show that a 1-unit increase in the HyFi dummy is associated with 0.0167 units less volatility in the 90th
percentile, signaling substantial crisis resilience.


HyFi effects across quantiles are illustrated in Figure 6. Notably, market shocks are insignificant at lower
quantiles but turn significantly negative at the 75 [th] and 90 [th] percentiles. This implies that, under high-risk
conditions, systemic shocks may trigger flight-to-quality behavior, where investors shift toward
relatively safer assets, such as HyFi-like tokens. While this does not isolate a specific event, such
behavior is consistent with market reactions observed during episodes like the Terra Luna collapse.

**Figure 6.** Quantile effects of HyFi status on price risk


**Note:** Coefficient paths from quantile regressions at 𝜏∈{0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90} . Points show estimates for


the HyFi-like dummy; vertical bars are ±95% intervals using reported standard errors. Estimates become more


negative at higher quantiles, indicating stronger stabilization in the tails.


The role of decentralization also exhibits meaningful variation across quantiles. The coefficient of


decentralization increases substantially in higher quantiles (from 0.0014 to 0.081), confirming that


highly decentralized tokens are more vulnerable to tail risk. This strengthens the earlier interpretation


that governance fragmentation exacerbates instability in extreme market environments. These results


not only validate the baseline findings but also show that the stabilizing effect of HyFi-like design and


the destabilizing role of decentralization are most pronounced when volatility spikes.


A final robustness check involves a structural break analysis around the Terra Luna collapse of May


2022, one of the largest DeFi failures in history. By re-estimating the model for pre- and post-crash


subsamples (Table 11), we assess whether the impact of decentralization and institutional features


changed in response to this crisis. The results are striking. Prior to the crash, decentralization was


negatively associated with price risk, suggesting a stabilizing role. However, in the post-crash period, this


relationship reverses: greater decentralization is now linked to higher volatility, likely reflecting


diminished investor confidence in unregulated, fragmented governance systems.


A similar shift is observed in the effect of market shocks. While previously insignificant, market shocks


became significantly positive after the Terra collapse, indicating that investors began responding more


strongly to systemic risk events. This change reflects heightened market sensitivity and a growing


perception that DeFi-related failures can trigger broader contagion effects. Attractiveness also becomes


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


more influential post-crash, while the stabilizing size effect diminishes, and the impacts of illiquidity and


market volatility remain relatively stable, though volatility’s magnitude slightly declines.


Crucially, the HyFi-like dummy retains its negative and significant association with price risk in both


periods, reaffirming the robustness of the central hypothesis. The interaction term with market volatility


also remains significantly negative, suggesting that institutional backing continues to buffer systemic


shocks even under extreme stress. This consistency reinforces the view that institutional integration not


only reduces average volatility but also enhances the long-term resilience of digital assets. To illustrate


this attenuation, Figure 7 plots the HyFi × market volatility coefficients from the fixed-effects models


before and after the Terra collapse.

Collectively, these findings underscore the nuanced interplay between governance structures, market
dynamics, and external shocks in shaping cryptocurrency volatility. The consistent negative effect of
HyFi-like status on price risk across models suggests that institutional integration plays a meaningful role
in stabilizing crypto markets. These insights are relevant not only to investors seeking to manage
portfolio risk but also to regulators and policymakers considering the systemic implications of
decentralized finance.


**5.** **Conclusion**


This study investigates whether HyFi-like cryptocurrencies, defined by institutional support and


structured governance, exhibit lower price risk compared to their fully decentralized counterparts. Using


a high-frequency panel dataset of 18 cryptocurrencies from 1 January 2020 to 24 November 2024, the


empirical strategy applies panel EGLS models under both fixed- and random-effects specifications,


including dynamic variants that account for persistence in volatility. Robustness is confirmed through


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


quantile regressions across the price risk distribution and structural break analysis around the Terra


Luna crash, one of the most disruptive events in DeFi history.


The results consistently reveal that HyFi-like cryptocurrencies are associated with significantly lower


price risk. This stabilizing effect becomes even more pronounced during periods of heightened market


volatility, suggesting that institutional infrastructure and governance mechanisms play a crucial role in


shielding assets from systemic shocks. The robustness of these results across quantile regressions,


particularly in the upper tails of the volatility distribution, and during the post-Terra Luna crash period,


underscores the resilience conferred by institutional characteristics. These cryptocurrencies appear


better insulated against extreme market fluctuations, suggesting that HyFi structures serve as stabilizers


in otherwise turbulent crypto markets.


Equally notable is the role of decentralization. The decentralization index is positively and significantly


associated with price risk across nearly all models. Contrary to the ideological appeal of decentralization,


the empirical evidence suggests that excessive governance dispersion may amplify price volatility. This


relationship becomes especially stark during high-volatility episodes and following major market shocks


such as the Terra Luna collapse, where decentralized assets exhibited heightened risk. These results


highlight the operational and informational fragility that can accompany purely decentralized


governance models, particularly in crisis conditions.


Additional determinants such as size, illiquidity, investor attention, market-wide volatility, and external


shocks also exert significant effects on price risk, revealing a multifaceted and interdependent volatility


structure. Larger cryptocurrencies exhibit lower volatility, while less liquid and highly visible tokens


experience greater price swings. Market-wide volatility remains the most dominant driver, but its


marginal effect is moderated in the presence of institutional backing. Notably, the impact of these


variables intensifies in the tails of risk distribution, indicating nonlinearity in how fundamental features


affect extreme outcomes. The insights could be operationalized in regulatory stress testing frameworks


or embedded into trading platforms as part of crypto risk-scoring models. For instance, classification


based on HyFi-like institutional characteristics could inform portfolio diversification strategies or be


integrated into capital adequacy assessments for crypto-exposed financial institutions.


From a policy and implementation standpoint, these findings suggest that HyFi classification could be


integrated into regulatory risk assessments, market surveillance systems, or portfolio construction tools.


Trading platforms and institutional allocators may benefit from factoring institutional exposure,


governance centralization, and volatility interaction effects into crypto asset evaluations.


While the results are robust and the large-T, small-N panel structure mitigates dynamic panel biases


such as Nickell bias, limitations remain. These include potential endogeneity from unobserved time

varying factors and partial generalizability due to the focus on mid- to large-cap cryptocurrencies.


Nonetheless, the diversity of the sampled tokens, spanning centralized exchanges, DEXs, DeFi platforms,


and HyFi assets, ensures relevance across major segments of the crypto ecosystem.


Sovbetov, I. (2025). _Computational Economics_


Overall, the study contributes to the emerging literature on institutionalization in digital finance by


demonstrating that HyFi-like structures are not only conceptually distinct but empirically associated with


greater stability. These insights are highly relevant for regulators, investors, and developers seeking to


reduce systemic risk while scaling blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Future research should


examine how hybrid governance mechanisms evolve and whether regulatory engagement can further


reinforce stability in decentralized asset markets.
