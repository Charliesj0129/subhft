Signal decay and regime shifts pose recurring challenges for datadriven investment strategies in non-stationary markets. Conventional time-series and machine learning approaches, which rely
primarily on historical correlations, often struggle to generalize
when the economic environment changes. While large language
models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities for processing unstructured
information, their potential to support quantitative factor screening
through explicit economic reasoning remains underexplored. Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time
series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a
factor is economically relevant.
We propose Alpha-R1, an 8B-parameter reasoning model trained
via reinforcement learning for context-aware alpha screening. AlphaR1 reasons over factor logic and real-time news to evaluate alpha
relevance under changing market conditions, selectively activating
or deactivating factors based on contextual consistency. Empirical
results across multiple asset pools show that Alpha-R1 consistently
outperforms benchmark strategies and exhibits improved robustness to alpha decay. The full implementation and resources are

The paradigm of factor investing has remained a cornerstone of
modern asset management since the seminal work of Fama and
French [7]. Theoretical evolution, ranging from the foundational

growth of market data, has culminated in the high-dimensional
phenomenon known as the Factor Zoo [8].
At the same time, advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have empowered the extraction of valuable sentiment
signals from extensive unstructured data sources, such as news
and financial reports [28]. The field has witnessed a paradigm shift
from general-purpose architectures toward domain-specific foundation models. Notable examples, including BloombergGPT [44] and
FinGPT [26], have validated the effectiveness of pre-training and
fine-tuning on financial datasets, often leveraging efficient adaptation methods like LoRA [16]. These specialized models have set new
performance standards [47], demonstrating superior capabilities
in tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition
compared to generalist models [29, 49, 51].
However, a key gap remains in unifying these data streams. Traditional numerical indicators and textual signals are often treated as
separate modalities, combined through static weighting schemes or
heuristic rules rather than within a unified framework that captures
their semantic interactions in dynamic decision-making. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have substantially expanded the scope of automated reasoning. NLP has shifted from
task-specific supervision toward promptable, general-purpose systems that, augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning, can address increasingly complex cognitive
tasks.
The integration of these systems into factor investing is far from
mature. The financial domain is characterized by inherent nonstationarity, noise, and high dimensionality [8, 13], necessitating
adaptive reasoning to navigate uncertainty, such as assessing the
relative merit of value versus momentum factors under shifting
macroeconomic conditions. These demands stand in stark contrast
to the deterministic nature of coding or mathematical benchmarks
typically employed for LLMs [14]. Although alternative methodologies like sparsity-based machine learning (e.g., Lasso) are available [9], they frequently suffer from poor interpretability and instability during market regime changes. Conversely, general-purpose


LLMs typically lack alignment with financial principles, making it
difficult to produce verifiable justifications for factor selection or
transparent decision traces [40].
Current research on LLMs in finance has largely focused on
factor mining, namely the discovery of novel signals from textual
or multimodal data. This line of work is closely related to opendomain question answering, where the primary goal is information
extraction. A growing literature leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs for this purpose. For instance, Cheng et al. [5] showed
that GPT-4 can generate factors with high Sharpe ratios supported
by economic rationales, while Wang et al. [42] proposed promptbased extraction methods for profitable factors. To further operationalize factor generation, Cao [2] introduced Chain-of-Alpha, a
dual-chain architecture that generates seed factors and iteratively
refines them using backtesting feedback. Related frameworks, including Alpha-GPT [43, 48] and R&D-Agent-Quant [24], explore
human-in-the-loop and multi-agent systems to bridge hypothesis
generation and code implementation. To address alpha decay, Tang
et al. [39] proposed regularization based on abstract syntax trees to
encourage factor originality. More recently, Kou et al. [21] utilize
LLMs to extract trading signals from multimodal data, including
financial text and market information.
As factor generation capabilities improve, evaluation has emerged
as a key bottleneck. To address this, Ding et al. [6] proposed AlphaEval, a five-dimensional framework that evaluates factors without
backtesting. Nevertheless, a fundamental gap remains between
broad factor mining and the path-dependent reasoning required
for systematic factor screening. Recent efforts such as TradingR1 [45], Fin-R1 [27], and FinO1 [33] enhance reasoning capabilities
in financial LLMs, yet factor screening decisions remain highly
context-dependent and time-varying. A factor that performs well
in an inflationary regime may become ineffective, or even harmful,
during a recession.
To address these structural limitations, we propose Alpha-R1,
a dynamic investment framework anchored by a specialized reasoning model trained via reinforcement learning. Distinct from
generic LLM applications or purely agentic frameworks [15, 46],
Alpha-R1 serves as the system’s cognitive core, designed to support
the sequential reasoning required for dynamic factor screening.
It inductively reasons over heterogeneous market information to
assess the economic relevance of candidate factors and construct
portfolios aligned with prevailing market conditions. In addition,
Alpha-R1 attributes return sources in a structured manner, enabling
transparent explanations of factor selection decisions. This design
addresses both the opacity of traditional quantitative models and
the static reasoning of existing financial LLMs, advancing regimeaware and interpretable portfolio construction.
Our primary contributions are as follows. First, we develop a
practical investment framework that bridges static quantitative
models and dynamic market environments. By synthesizing heterogeneous information, including macroeconomic indicators and
news narratives, the framework enables regime-aware factor screening and dynamically adjusts portfolio exposure based on the semantic alignment between factor rationales and prevailing market
conditions.
Second, we design a specialized reasoning core by adapting the
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) paradigm



Jiang et al.


to the financial domain. Instead of relying on subjective human
preferences, we construct an objective reward signal based on realized market performance, such as volatility-adjusted returns. This
design aligns the model’s reasoning process with realistic trading
objectives and supports sequential decision-making under uncertainty.
Finally, we conduct extensive backtesting across multiple asset pools beyond standard market indices. The results show that
Alpha-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks
and traditional factor strategies, demonstrating robustness to alpha
decay and the ability to deliver explainable, superior risk-adjusted
performance across market regimes.


**2** **Related Work**

**2.1** **LLMs in Quantitative Trading**


_2.1.1_ _Financial Foundation Models and Adaptation._ Before the advent of reasoning-centric approaches, the adaptation of LLMs to
finance primarily focused on domain-specific pre-training and instruction tuning. BloombergGPT [44] established a benchmark by
training on a massive mixed corpus of financial and general data.
To democratize access, open-source efforts like FinGPT [26] and
Instruct-FinGPT [49] utilized efficient fine-tuning techniques to
adapt general-purpose models for financial tasks. Additionally, BBTFin [29] and XuanYuan 2.0 [51] have explored Chinese financial
benchmarks, while PIXIU [47] provided a comprehensive evaluation framework for these instruction-tuned models.


_2.1.2_ _LLMs for Alpha Factor Generation._ The integration of LLMs
has catalyzed a paradigm shift in quantitative trading, particularly
within the domain of alpha factor mining, where models automate
the discovery of novel, interpretable predictive signals. Contemporary research has evolved from simple signal generation to sophisticated agent-based frameworks. A prominent research trajectory
focuses on mitigating alpha decay through iterative refinement. For
instance, AlphaAgent [39] introduces a framework that enforces
factor originality and robustness using abstract syntax tree (AST)
similarity measures. Complementing this, Chain-of-Alpha [2] proposes a dual-chain architecture consisting of a factor generation
chain and a factor optimization chain to iteratively refine candidate
factors based on feedback from backtesting. Similarly, AlphaForge

[38] adopts a two-stage generative and predictive neural network
to enhance the mining process. Beyond fully autonomous systems,
recent work has also explored human-AI collaboration [43, 48].


_2.1.3_ _LLM-based Quant Agents._ Moving beyond the paradigm of
discrete factor mining, the research frontier has expanded towards
developing holistic, AI-driven agents capable of orchestrating the
entire investment lifecycle. A primary research trajectory focuses
on fine-tuning LLMs for direct return forecasting. Guo and Hauptmann [12] demonstrate that adapting models to unstructured data,
such as news flow, substantially enhances stock selection capabilities, while also providing critical comparative insights into the
efficacy of encoder-only (e.g., DeBERTa) versus decoder-only (e.g.,
Mistral) architectures.
To address the downstream complexities of execution and risk
management, however, the field is increasingly pivoting towards
multi-agent orchestration. Kou et al. [21] propose a hierarchical


Alpha-R1: Alpha Screening with LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning


framework where LLMs function as specialized alpha generators,
with distinct agents responsible for dynamic weight optimization.
This architectural philosophy that segregates signal generation
from risk control parallels the modular design of reinforcement
learning systems such as QF-FRL [5] and general multi-agent frameworks like MetaGPT [15]. This trend culminates in comprehensive ecosystems like TradingGPT [25], FinMem [23], and FinAgent [1, 50], which employ multimodal perception [21] and collaborative agent workflows (e.g., TradingAgents [46]) to autonomously
navigate the full spectrum of trading activities. Additionally, Koa
et al. [20] integrated self-reflection mechanisms to refine predictions, addressing hallucination issues common in these complex
agents [17].


**2.2** **Methods for Screening Alpha Factors**


_2.2.1_ _Machine Learning in Regularized and Sparsity-Driven Selec-_
_tion._ The most direct machine learning approach to addressing
the Factor Zoo is the application of sparsity-inducing regularization, such as Lasso [41]. This method imposes sparsity by adding a
penalty term, effectively shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant or
redundant factors to zero. Building on this principle, Mai et al. [30]
adopt the Lasso method to address severe multicollinearity among
feature indicators in the A-share market, finding that it yields superior stability and predictive accuracy compared to traditional
unregularized linear methods.


_2.2.2_ _Machine Learning in Tree-Based and Non-Linear Screening._
A second pathway leverages tree-based ensemble models. Gu et al.

[10] provided a milestone comparison of ML methods, establishing
that neural networks and regression trees demonstrate exceptional
performance in capturing nonlinear interactions for return prediction. In this approach, factors are typically screened based on
feature importance scores. Mai et al. [30] employed tree-based models and deep feedforward Neural Networks to evaluate the efficacy
of factors selected by Lasso. Their results confirmed the efficacy of
non-linear models in portfolio management, consistently identifying key predictive factors such as momentum and earnings yield
across varying market regimes.


_2.2.3_ _Deep Learning in Factor Compression._ In contrast to selecting a sparse subset of factors, deep learning techniques offer an
alternative by compressing the high-dimensional factor universe
into a low-dimensional set of latent representations. This is typically achieved through autoencoders or similar architectures. While
effective at dimension reduction, a fundamental limitation lies in
the opaque black box nature of these models, which often obscures
the economic interpretation of the resulting latent factors. To address this, Mai et al. [30] propose a hybrid CPCA framework that
combines clustering with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
construct lower-dimensional investment factors while maintaining
a degree of interpretability often lost in purely deep learning-based
approaches.


**2.3** **Reinforcement Learning for LLMs**


Reinforcement learning has established itself as a cornerstone paradigm for aligning LLMs with human intent and augmenting their
reasoning faculties [19]. The dominant framework, reinforcement



learning from human feedback (RLHF), was introduced to bolster
instruction-following capabilities [32]. This paradigm predominantly relies on proximal policy optimization (PPO) [35], which
utilizes a learned value function to estimate advantages and ensure
training stability via a clipped surrogate objective. However, the
requirement to maintain a value model incurs significant memory and computational overhead. Moreover, traditional RLHF faces
challenges such as reward hacking and instability [4, 22]. To mitigate these, alternative preference optimization methods like direct
preference optimization (DPO) [34] and simple preference optimization (SimPO) [31] have been proposed to bypass explicit reward
modeling.
To circumvent computational bottlenecks in reasoning-intensive
tasks, recent methodological advancements have increasingly favored critic-free optimization paradigms. Notably, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) [36] has emerged as a robust alternative. Diverging from PPO, GRPO eschews the need for a separate value network by approximating the baseline via the mean
rewards of a group of outputs sampled from the current policy.
This group-relative formulation significantly reduces the computational footprint of RL training while preserving optimization
stability. DeepSeek-R1 [11] exemplifies the efficacy of this paradigm in fostering self-evolving reasoning chains. This paradigm is
now permeating the financial domain; for instance, Trading-R1 [45]
utilizes a curriculum of supervised fine-tuning and RL to structure
investment theses, while Fin-R1 [27] and FinO1 [33] explore the
transferability of reasoning capabilities to financial tasks. This directly motivates our adoption of this critic-free architecture for
Alpha-R1, optimizing factor screening logic against objective market feedback.


**3** **Methodology**

**3.1** **Data, Memory, and Factor Baselines**


We establish the foundational data structures, historical context,
and quantitative benchmarks through a systematic process.


_3.1.1_ _Raw Data Abstraction._ We first transform heterogeneous raw
data into structured textual atomic units. At each time step _𝑡_, we
construct two complementary market descriptors:

   - Price Market Description ( _𝑆𝑡_ [price] ): Summarizes information
from technical indicators, trading volume, and sector rotation patterns.

   - News Market Description ( _𝑆𝑡_ [news] ): Encodes information
from financial news and macroeconomic announcements
to capture prevailing market sentiment.


_3.1.2_ _Iterative Memory Construction._ We employ an iterative memory construction pipeline to capture long-term market context. This
process aggregates the atomic textual units into a coherent historical narrative. Let _𝐼𝑤_ = { _𝑆𝑡_ [price] _,𝑆𝑡_ [news] } _𝑡_ ∈ _𝑤_ denote the set of market
descriptions within week _𝑤_ . The weekly market summary _𝑀𝑤_ is
updated recursively using a large language model:


_𝑀𝑤_ = _𝐹_ LLM ( _𝐼𝑤_ ⊕ _𝑀𝑤_ −1) _._ (1)


After iterating through the entire backtest period, we obtain
the comprehensive backtest period market description ( _𝑀_ global).
This encapsulates the structural evolution and regime shifts of the

market, forming the long-term historical memory required for the
subsequent semantic profiling.


_3.1.3_ _Factor Backtesting._ To establish the ground truth for factor
behavior, we perform a backtest on the entire factor pool U over
the historical window. For each factor _𝑖_, we obtain a quantitative
performance vector _𝑃𝑖_, which includes key metrics such as returns,
volatility, and decay characteristics. This dataset serves as the objective basis for linking market memory with factor effectiveness.


**3.2** **Profiling and State Description**


Building on the prepared data foundation and long-term market
memory, we construct the semantic state representations required
for decision-making.


_3.2.1_ _Factor Semantic Descriptions._ This stage maps quantitative
signals into structured semantic representations. We combine the
global market description from the backtest period, _𝑀_ global, with
the factor-specific backtest results _𝑃𝑖_ . An LLM then generates a
semantic profile _𝛼_ des _,𝑖_ for each factor _𝑖_ :


_𝛼_ des _,𝑖_ = _𝐹_ LLM ( _𝑀_ global _, 𝑃𝑖_ ) _._ (2)


Each profile articulates the factor’s underlying mechanism, its suitability across market regimes (e.g., high-volatility environments),
and its limitations or failure conditions. These semantic descriptions
serve as an instruction manual for the reasoning core in subsequent
decision-making.


_3.2.2_ _Asset Pool State Description._ To characterize the current investment environment, we construct an asset pool state description.
In contrast to the long-term market memory, this representation
is generated dynamically for each decision day _𝑡_ . Using the daily



atomic units, ( _𝑆𝑡_ [price] _,𝑆𝑡_ [news] ), we synthesize the instantaneous market
state:

_𝑆𝑡_ = _𝐹_ LLM ( _𝑆𝑡_ [price] _,𝑆𝑡_ [news] ) _._ (3)


The resulting state captures the prevailing index dynamics, dominant sector themes, and capital flow patterns, providing the situational context for subsequent factor selection decisions.


**3.3** **The Alpha-R1 Reasoning Model**


The Alpha-R1 model serves as the central reasoning agent for factor
screening and selection. At each decision time _𝑡_, a semantic decision
context _𝐶𝑡_ is constructed by combining two components:


_𝐶𝑡_ = { _𝛼_ des _,𝑖_ } _𝑖_ ∈U ⊕ _𝑆𝑡_ _,_ (4)


where:


  - { _𝛼_ des _,𝑖_ } denotes the set of semantic factor descriptions for
the candidate pool U.

  - _𝑆𝑡_ is the contemporaneous semantic market state synthesized via _𝐹_ LLM as defined in Equation 3, which encapsulates
price dynamics and news narratives at time _𝑡_ .


Based on this high-dimensional semantic context _𝐶𝑡_, Alpha-R1
performs inference to output the final selected factor list, denoted
as A _𝑡_ . We interpret this mechanism as a context-conditioned gating
process where the LLM functions as a network that activates or
deactivates factors based on semantic alignment between (i) factor mechanism profiles and failure conditions, and (ii) the current
market state summarized from price dynamics and news narratives.
This delegation of non-stationarity adaptation to the reasoning core
allows the system to navigate regime shifts without the instability
of purely numerical re-estimation.


Alpha-R1: Alpha Screening with LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning


Theoretically, we interpret our framework as a context-conditioned
sparse linear model. The fixed linear scorer provides a stable, lowvariance mapping from factor exposures to stock ranking. In regimeswitching markets, the dominant error source is often model misspecification rather than within-regime estimation. While a purely
dynamic linear model must re-estimate coefficients from limited
and noisy samples—inducing high variance and overreaction to
transient correlations—our approach reduces misspecification and
estimation noise. By conditioning factor activation on richer state information and enforcing parsimonious selection, Alpha-R1 achieves
more robust out-of-sample performance.


**3.4** **Reinforcement Learning via GRPO with**
**Market Feedback**


We optimize the Alpha-R1 reasoning model using reinforcement
learning. This design enables learning directly from objective market feedback, adapting the RLHF paradigm to replace subjective
human preferences with performance-based financial signals. The
reward function combines quantitative portfolio outcomes with
assessments of reasoning quality, and training is carried out using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to ensure stable and
efficient policy updates.


_3.4.1_ _Backbone Model and Stability._ We adopt Qwen3-8B as the
backbone model for its strong reasoning capabilities. This initialization accelerates convergence during reinforcement learning and
improves the consistency and structure of generated outputs. In
the absence of such a warm start, models are prone to overfitting
superficial heuristics, leading to unstable or incoherent reasoning.
The pre-trained backbone provides a stable foundation that preserves prior knowledge, allowing reinforcement learning to refine
the model’s reasoning behavior.


_3.4.2_ _Multi-Component Reward Function with Market Feedback._
We design a multi-component reward function that balances market
performance with reasoning discipline:


_𝑅_ final = _𝑅_ adjusted − _𝑃_ structural _,_ (5)


where _𝑅_ adjusted captures market-based performance feedback, and
_𝑃_ structural denotes the structural penalties that regulate action validity and sparsity. The reward components are computed through
the following pipeline.


_Rule-based Performance Reward._ Market feedback is obtained via
a backtesting procedure based on a linear factor model trained on
four years of historical data. We adopt a linear specification for
three reasons: it provides a stable and interpretable mapping from
factor exposures to expected returns, enables direct attribution
of performance to selected factors, and avoids introducing nonstationarity into the reward signal during reinforcement learning
by keeping the evaluation model fixed.


(1) Linear Model: We use fixed regression coefficients _𝛽𝑖_ estimated from historical data.
(2) For each stock, predicted returns are computed using the
selected factor set A _𝑡_ :


∑︁
_𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛_ predicted = _𝛽_ 0 + ( _𝛽𝑖_ × _𝑉𝑖_ ) _,_ (6)


_𝑖_ ∈A _𝑡_



where _𝑉𝑖_ denotes the previous-day value of factor _𝑖_, and
unselected factors contribute zero.
(3) Portfolio Construction: Stocks are ranked by predicted returns, and the top _𝑁_ are selected to form an equal-weighted
portfolio.
(4) Base Reward Calculation: Compute the excess return over
the benchmark over a holding period _𝐻_, scaled for the
reward function:

_𝑅_ base = [�] Returnport (A _𝑡, 𝐻_ ) − Returnbench ( _𝐻_ ) [�] × 100 _,_ (7)

where _𝐻_ denotes the holding period (e.g., _𝐻_ = 5 days) used
for both the portfolio and the benchmark returns.


_Quality-Adjusted Reward with LLM-as-Judge Evaluation._ We incorporate reasoning quality into the reward through LLM-as-ajudge evaluation, in which an external large language model automatically assesses the model’s generated reasoning. A consistency
penalty _𝑃_ consistency is computed as


_𝑃_ consistency = _𝐹_ Judge ( _𝐶𝑡,_ A _𝑡_ _,_ response) _,_ (8)
where _𝐹_ Judge denotes a judge LLM (e.g., Claude 3.5 Haiku) that
evaluates dimensions such as logical coherence, linguistic fluency,
and information redundancy. The variable response represents the
full textual output generated by the Alpha-R1 reasoning core, which
encompasses both the chain-of-thought reasoning process and the
final selected factor list A _𝑡_ . The resulting score is normalized as
_𝑃_ norm = _𝑃_ consistency/10 _._ 0 and applied asymmetrically to adjust the
base reward:



_𝑅_ adjusted =




_𝑅_ base × (1 − _𝑃_ norm) if _𝑅_ base _>_ 0
(9)
_𝑅_ base × (1 + _𝑃_ norm) if _𝑅_ base ≤ 0 _[.]_



_Structural Penalties._ We incorporate a comprehensive structural
penalty _𝑃_ structural to enforce output discipline. This term qualitatively combines the requirements for parsimony and validity: it
encourages the model to select a concise set of factors to avoid
over-complexity, while strictly penalizing the generation of unparsable or non-existent factors to ensure the reasoning results are
executable within the quantitative backtesting framework.


_3.4.3_ _GRPO Optimization with Market-Aligned Objectives._ We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune the
Alpha-R1 model. The normalized advantage estimate is computed
as:




[mean][(] _[𝑟]_ [)]

std( _𝑟_ ) _,_ _𝜌𝑡_ [(] _[𝑖]_ [)] ( _𝜃_ ) = _𝜋_ _[𝜋]_ _𝜃_ _[𝜃]_ [(] _[𝑜]_ _𝑜_ _[𝑖,𝑡]_ _𝑖,𝑡_ [|] _[ 𝑞,𝑜]_ | _𝑞,𝑜_ _[𝑖,]_ _𝑖,_ _[<]_ _<_ _[𝑡]_ [)] _𝑡_



_𝐴_ ˆ _𝑖_ = _[𝑟][𝑖]_ [−] [mean][(] _[𝑟]_ [)]



(10)
_𝜋𝜃_ old ( _𝑜𝑖,𝑡_ | _𝑞,𝑜𝑖,<𝑡_ ) _[,]_



where _𝜌𝑡_ [(] _[𝑖]_ [)] ( _𝜃_ ) denotes the probability ratio between the current
and old policies. The GRPO objective function is defined as:



_𝐺_
∑︁


_𝑖_ =1



1
| _𝑜𝑖_ |



∑︁| _𝑜𝑖_ | 
min _𝜌𝑡_ [(] _[𝑖]_ [)] ( _𝜃_ ) _𝐴_ [ˆ] _𝑖,_
_𝑡_ =1



_𝐽_ GRPO ( _𝜃_ ) = E _𝑞,_ { _𝑜𝑖_ }

_𝐺_




       -       -       - [�]
clip _𝜌𝑡_ [(] _[𝑖]_ [)] ( _𝜃_ ) _,_ 1 − _𝜖,_ 1 + _𝜖_ _𝐴_ ˆ _𝑖_


- _𝛽_ E _𝑞_ [ _𝐷_ KL ( _𝜋𝜃_ (· | _𝑞_ )∥ _𝜋_ ref (· | _𝑞_ ))] _,_



(11)



where:


  - _𝑞_ represents the input context, including market state and
factor descriptions;

  - _𝑜𝑖_ represents the _𝑖_ -th response in the group of size _𝐺_ ;

  - _𝜋𝜃_, _𝜋_ old, and _𝜋_ ref denote the current, sampling, and reference
policies, respectively;

  - _𝛽_ controls the KL-divergence regularization strength, and
_𝜖_ is the clipping parameter.


The objective function consists of two primary components: (1) a
clipped surrogate objective that encourages policy updates towards
higher advantage, and (2) a KL-divergence regularization term preventing deviation from the reference model. This ensures stable
training while optimizing for the market-aligned reward defined in
Equation 5. Through this approach, Alpha-R1 learns to select factor
combinations that not only generate superior excess returns but
also exhibit coherent and interpretable reasoning patterns.


**3.5** **Portfolio Construction and Execution**


To translate factor selection into realized market performance, we
implement a practical execution mechanism that accounts for liquidity constraints and transaction costs. Given the factor set A _𝑡_
selected by Alpha-R1, portfolio positions are constructed using a
slot rotation strategy and executed via volume-weighted average
price (VWAP)–based trading.


_3.5.1_ _Slot Rotation Mechanism._ To mitigate the high turnover costs
typically associated with daily rebalancing, we divide the total
capital _𝐶_ into _𝐻_ independent sub-portfolios (referred to as slots),
where _𝐻_ corresponds to the holding period (e.g., _𝐻_ = 5 days). On
any given trading day _𝑡_, only the specific slot indexed by _𝑘_ = _𝑡_
(mod _𝐻_ ) undergoes rebalancing:


_𝑃𝑡,𝑘_ = Rebalance( _𝑃𝑡_ −1 _,𝑘,_ A _𝑡_ ) _,_ (12)


where _𝑃𝑡,𝑘_ represents the holdings of the _𝑘_ -th slot. The remaining
_𝐻_ - 1 slots remain passive. This approach effectively smooths out
the equity curve and reduces the average daily turnover rate to 1/ _𝐻_,
allowing for broader market coverage without incurring excessive
friction costs.


_3.5.2_ _VWAP-based Execution and Constraints._ Unlike simplified
backtesting engines that assume execution at the opening price
_𝑃_ open, we employ a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) model
to better approximate realized trading costs. For a selected stock _𝑠_,
the execution price _𝑃_ [ˆ] _𝑠,𝑡_ is computed using transaction data from
the first 30 minutes of the trading session (09:31–10:00):


�30
_𝑃_ ˆ _𝑠,𝑡_ = _𝑖_ =1 [(] _[𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒]_ ~~�~~ 30 _[𝑠,𝑡,𝑖]_ [×] _[ 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒][𝑠,𝑡,𝑖]_ [)] _._ (13)

_𝑖_ =1 _[𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒][𝑠,𝑡,𝑖]_


This interval corresponds to the period of highest market liquidity
and provides a conservative estimate of execution slippage. To
ensure market realism, the execution process enforces the following
constraints:


   - Limit-Move Constraints: Buy orders are rejected if the stock
hits the upper price limit (Limit-Up) during the execution
window, and sell orders are deferred if the stock is locked
at the lower price limit (Limit-Down).



Jiang et al.


   - IPO Exclusion: Stocks are strictly excluded from trading on
their initial listing day to avoid extreme volatility distortions.

   - Transaction Costs: A transaction fee of 0.1% (10 bps) is applied to both buy and sell orders to account for commissions
and slippage.


The daily portfolio return _𝑅𝑡_ is computed as the aggregate return across all _𝐻_ slots, providing an overall measure of executionadjusted strategy performance.


**4** **Experiments**


This section presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
Alpha-R1. We benchmark Alpha-R1 against a range of traditional
quantitative strategies and state-of-the-art large language models
(LLMs) to assess its effectiveness in dynamic market environments.
Our evaluation is guided by the following research questions:
**Q1:** Does Alpha-R1 consistently outperform traditional machine
learning baselines and reasoning LLMs across distinct asset pools?
**Q2:** What are the contributions of individual components (e.g.,
news, price, semantic descriptions) to the model’s performance?
**Q3:** Does the semantic gating mechanism of Alpha-R1 offer
tangible advantages over traditional heuristic gating strategies?
**Q4:** How sensitive is the model’s performance to hyperparameter variations?


**4.1** **Experimental Setup**


_4.1.1_ _Dataset and Dynamic Factor Zoo._ We construct a dynamic
factor zoo by filtering the Alpha101 library [18], retaining 82 computationally feasible factors. To avoid look-ahead bias, the experiments
are temporally segmented:
_Pre-training Phase (2020.01.01 – 2023.12.31):_ Used solely to estimate the fixed coefficients _𝛽𝑖_ for the linear reward model described
in Section 3.4.
_Training Phase (2024.07.01 – 2024.12.31):_ Using constituent stocks
from the CSI 300, we simulate a high-turnover environment. To
encourage semantic reasoning rather than factor memorization, we
adopt a randomized factor augmentation scheme: for each trading
date, 300 training samples are generated, each with a randomly
selected subset of 40 factors drawn from the full pool of 82 as the
state input.
_Testing Phase (2025.01.01 – 2025.06.30):_ For strictly out-of-sample
evaluation, we construct a fixed candidate set of 40 factors selected
based on historical RankIC performance over 2023–2024. Evaluation
is conducted on both the CSI 300 (large-cap, in-domain) and the CSI
1000 (small-cap, out-of-domain) universes to assess generalization
across asset pools. While both are temporally out-of-sample, the
CSI 1000 evaluates zero-shot spatial generalization.


_4.1.2_ _Baselines and Model Configuration._ We compare Alpha-R1
against two classes of baselines. The first consists of traditional
quantitative strategies, including statistical methods (PCA), treebased ensembles (XGBoost and LightGBM), and deep reinforcement learning approaches (A2C and PPO). The second class comprises reasoning-enabled large language models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro Thinking, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, DeepSeek-R1,
and the base model Qwen3-8B.

Consistent with the execution protocol described in Section 3.5,
we employ a _slot rotation strategy_ with a holding period of _𝐻_ = 5
days, managing five concurrent sub-portfolios. Each slot selects
_𝑇𝑜𝑝𝑁_ = 10 stocks, and trades are executed using 30-minute VWAP
prices with a fixed bilateral transaction cost of 0.1%.
To prevent data leakage and ensure a fair evaluation, all benchmark LLMs have pre-training data cutoffs strictly no later than December 31, 2024. Alpha-R1 adopts Qwen3-8B as its backbone model.
Inference is performed deterministically with temperature=0 and
top_p=0.7.



_4.1.3_ _Evaluation Protocol._ Performance is evaluated using cumulative return (CR), annualized return (AR), Sharpe ratio (SR), and
maximum drawdown (MDD). To reduce the impact of random initialization, all reported backtesting results are averaged over five
independent runs.


**4.2** **Performance Evaluation**


We first evaluate the capacity of Alpha-R1 to generate excess returns. Table 1 details the quantitative metrics, while Figure 2 visualizes the wealth accumulation trajectories.


_4.2.1_ _Comparative Analysis on In-Domain Testing (CSI 300)._ As
shown in Table 1 and Figure 2a, Alpha-R1 achieves the strongest
performance on the CSI 300 domain.


  - _Comparison with tree-based models._ Gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost, while effective on static prediction
tasks, perform poorly in this setting (e.g., cumulative return of -10.03%). This highlights a critical limitation: in
non-stationary markets, the dominant error source is often
model misspecification rather than within-regime estimation. A purely dynamic model that re-estimates coefficients
from limited and noisy samples induces high variance and
can overreact to transient correlations as historical correlations deteriorate.

  - _Comparison with reinforcement learning methods._ Deep RL
approaches such as A2C and PPO struggle to adapt to the
non-stationary market environment. A2C achieves a negative cumulative return of -5.52% with a Sharpe ratio of -0.85,
while PPO shows only marginal positive returns (0.89%)
with a low Sharpe ratio of 0.11. This suggests that numerical
RL agents, despite their ability to learn sequential decisionmaking, are vulnerable to distributional shifts and fail to
capture the semantic relationships that govern factor effectiveness across different market regimes.

  - _Comparison with generic reasoning LLMs._ Models such as
Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1 demonstrate strong
general reasoning ability but lack domain-specific financial
grounding. As a result, they fail to adequately account for
risk constraints, leading to substantial drawdowns (approximately 15–16%) and negative Sharpe ratios.

  - _Performance of Alpha-R1._ By interpreting our framework as
a context-conditioned sparse linear model, Alpha-R1 attains
a Sharpe ratio of 1.62 while limiting maximum drawdown
to 6.76%. The fixed linear scorer provides a stable, lowvariance mapping, while the LLM reasoning core functions
as a gating network that activates or deactivates factors
based on semantic alignment. This allows for stable and
risk-aware decision-making even as market regimes shift.


_4.2.2_ _Zero-Shot Generalization on Out-of-Domain (CSI 1000)._ The
CSI 1000 experiment (Figure 2b) evaluates the model’s ability to
generalize under a zero-shot setting. Compared with the CSI 300,
the CSI 1000 represents a small-cap universe with higher volatility
and more pronounced idiosyncratic dynamics.
Numerical reinforcement learning agents, such as A2C and PPO,
exhibit limited generalization beyond the training domain. On the
CSI 300, A2C achieves a negative cumulative return of -5.52% with
a Sharpe ratio of -0.85, while PPO shows marginal positive returns
(0.89%) with a low Sharpe ratio of 0.11. When transferred to the
CSI 1000, A2C shows improved performance (cumulative return
of 11.80%) but PPO suffers significant degradation with a negative
return of -6.44% and a maximum drawdown of 29.31%, indicating
sensitivity to domain-specific statistical patterns and overfitting
issues.
In contrast, Alpha-R1 maintains strong performance on the outof-domain CSI 1000 universe, achieving a cumulative return of
42.49% and a Sharpe ratio of 4.03. This confirms the advantage of
delegating non-stationarity adaptation to the LLM. By conditioning



Jiang et al.


factor activation on richer state information (summarized from
price dynamics and news narratives) and enforcing parsimonious
selection, our approach reduces misspecification and estimation
noise. This mechanism enables robust zero-shot transfer by capturing higher-level economic relationships rather than relying on
noisy, domain-specific statistical regularities.


**4.3** **Ablation Study**


To dissect the contributions of individual components, we conduct a
series of ablation experiments to isolate the impact of key modules
in Alpha-R1. All ablation variants are trained from scratch using
the modified framework to ensure a fair comparison.


_4.3.1_ _Ablation Variants._ We consider the following four variants
to evaluate the necessity of data inputs, factor representations, and
the training objective:


  - _w/o News_ : Removes market news information from the state
space _𝑆𝑡_, forcing the model to rely solely on price data and
factor values.

  - _w/o Market Price_ : Removes market price trends from _𝑆𝑡_,
retaining only news narratives and factor values.

  - _w/o Semantic Description_ : Replaces the natural language descriptions of factors with their raw mathematical formulas
to test if the LLM relies on semantic reasoning or pattern
matching.

  - _w/o RL Optimization_ : Uses the backbone model (Qwen3-8B)
without the reinforcement learning alignment pipeline.


**Table 2: Ablation Study Results. Performance contribution of**
**different components (Testing Period: 2025.01.01 – 2025.06.30**
**on CSI 300).**


**Method** **CR (%)** **AR (%)** **SR** **MDD (%)**


**Alpha-R1 (Full)** **12.99** **27.59** **1.62** **6.76**


Buy & Hold (CSI 300 Index) 3.03 6.70 0.33 10.49
w/o Market Price 10.24 22.42 1.24 12.87
w/o News 8.75 19.61 1.03 12.01
w/o Semantic Description 7.26 16.76 0.83 13.32
w/o RL Optimization -6.32 -12.41 -0.77 16.35


_4.3.2_ _Results and Analysis._ Table 2 provides a quantitative decomposition of the performance contributions attributable to each module within the Alpha-R1 framework. By systematically ablating
key components, we elucidate the specific mechanisms driving
the model’s superior risk-adjusted returns. The empirical evidence
supports three principal conclusions regarding the architecture’s
efficacy:


_The Imperative of Reinforcement Learning Alignment._ The most
profound performance disparity is observed between the full model
and the w/o RL Optimization variant. The unaligned base model
(Qwen3-8B) fails to generate positive alpha, yielding a Sharpe Ratio
of -0.77, identical to the w/o RL Optimization case. This finding
corroborates the hypothesis that general-purpose reasoning capabilities, while necessary, are insufficient for the stochastic and
adversarial nature of financial markets. The RL alignment process

**(d) CSI 1000: Sharpe Ratio** **(e) CSI 1000: Cumulative Return** **(f) CSI 1000: Max Drawdown**


**Figure 3: Parameter Sensitivity and Generalization Analysis. The heatmaps illustrate the impact of varying** _**TopN**_ **and** _**Holding-**_

acts as a crucial transformation layer, grounding the LLM’s broad
semantic knowledge into specific, risk-aware actionable policies.
Without this targeted optimization, the model’s latent reasoning
capacity cannot be effectively translated into profitable trading
decisions.


_Semantic Reasoning Over Mathematical Memorization._ The degradation in performance observed in the w/o Semantic Description
variant—where natural language factor descriptions are replaced
by raw mathematical formulas—highlights the model’s reliance on
semantic reasoning. The Sharpe Ratio declines by approximately
49% (from 1.62 to 0.83). This substantial gap suggests that Alpha-R1
does not merely memorize statistical patterns associated with factor formulas. Instead, it leverages the semantic richness of natural
language to infer the economic rationale behind factors, enabling
more robust selection in changing market regimes compared to
purely symbolic processing.


_Synergistic Integration of Multi-Modal Signals._ The ablation of
informational inputs reveals the complementary nature of news
narratives and price dynamics. Excluding market news (w/o News)
results in a more severe deterioration of the Sharpe Ratio (dropping
to 1.03) compared to removing price trends (1.24). This implies
that qualitative news data serves as a superior leading indicator



for detecting regime shifts than historical price momentum alone.
However, the full model exhibits the lowest Maximum Drawdown
(6.76%), significantly outperforming both data-truncated variants.
This indicates a synergistic effect: while news provides high-level
context, price dynamics offer granular trend confirmation, and their
integration is essential for minimizing tail risk and ensuring robust
execution.
In synthesis, the superior performance of Alpha-R1 is not attributable to any single isolated component but emerges from the
holistic integration of semantic understanding, multi-modal context
awareness, and rigorous RL-based alignment.


**4.4** **Semantic vs. Heuristic Gating Strategies**


To validate the superiority of our semantic gating mechanism, we
compare it against traditional heuristic gating strategies. We consider:


   - Lasso: A classic sparse linear model selecting factors via _𝐿_ 1
regularization.

   - IC Momentum: A momentum-based heuristic selecting the
top 10 factors based on their recent average IC over a 20-day
window.


**Table 3: Gating Strategy Comparison. Performance of Alpha-**
**R1 (Semantic Gating) versus heuristic gating methods (Lasso**
**and IC Momentum) on the CSI 300 testing set.**


**Method** **CR (%)** **AR (%)** **SR** **MDD (%)**


**Alpha-R1 (Semantic Gating)** **12.99** **27.59** **1.62** **6.76**


Lasso 1.58 4.63 0.20 11.12
IC Momentum -6.33 -12.55 -0.80 13.29


As shown in Table 3, Alpha-R1 significantly outperforms both
heuristic baselines. While Lasso achieves a small positive return
(1.58%), it lags behind the semantic gating approach. IC Momentum
performs poorly (-6.33% CR), likely because historical IC measures
often fail to persist in highly dynamic regimes. In contrast, AlphaR1’s semantic gating leverages market context to adaptively select
factors, demonstrating superior robustness to regime shifts.


**4.5** **Robustness and Generalization**


To assess the strategy’s resilience, we conduct a parameter sensitivity analysis visualized via heatmaps in Figure 3.


_4.5.1_ _Parameter Sensitivity (CSI 300)._ The top row of Figure 3 visualizes performance metrics on the in-domain asset pool. We observe
broad green regions indicating high Sharpe Ratios across a wide
range of settings (e.g., Holding Days 3–10). Notably, performance
remains stable even as _𝑇𝑜𝑝𝑁_ increases from 5 to 20. This suggests
that Alpha-R1 identifies a cluster of effective factors rather than
relying on a single outlier signal, thereby reducing concentration
risk.


_4.5.2_ _Zero-Shot Generalization (CSI 1000)._ The bottom row of Figure 3 highlights the model’s performance on the out-of-domain CSI
1000 asset pool. Despite the significant shift in asset characteristics,
the heatmaps display a consistent distribution of high-performance
green clusters similar to the in-domain testing set. This confirms
that Alpha-R1 possesses strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. Unlike traditional models that degrade rapidly outside their
training distribution, Alpha-R1 leverages its semantic understanding of market regimes to dynamically adjust factor selections for
the new asset pool, delivering robust risk-adjusted returns without
retraining.


**5** **Conclusion**


This paper introduces Alpha-R1, a semantics-driven approach to
quantitative investment that shifts the focus from static factor mining to context-aware reasoning. Rather than relying solely on historical correlations, Alpha-R1 employs a reinforcement-learning–trained
large language model to reason over the economic rationale underlying factor performance and its dependence on evolving market
conditions.
By constructing a dual-layer semantic context that integrates
long-term market memory with real-time information, Alpha-R1
connects unstructured data sources with quantitative decisionmaking in a unified manner. Methodologically, we develop a marketaligned reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative



Jiang et al.


Policy Optimization (GRPO), in which training is guided by objective market outcomes instead of subjective human feedback.
Extensive empirical results show that Alpha-R1 consistently
outperforms traditional machine learning baselines and generic
reasoning LLMs across multiple asset pools. Notably, Alpha-R1
demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization when transferred
from the CSI 300 to the CSI 1000 universe, maintaining stable and
profitable performance in a previously unseen, high-volatility environment, where conventional reinforcement learning agents experience marked degradation. These findings suggest that grounding
factor selection in semantic reasoning and market feedback provides a viable approach for mitigating alpha decay and addressing
non-stationarity in financial markets.
