**Abstract**


This paper examines the impact of reducing Ethereum slot time on decentralized exchange


activity, with a focus on CEX-DEX arbitrage behavior. We develop a trading model where the


agent’s DEX transaction is not guaranteed to land, and the agent explicitly accounts for this


execution risk when deciding whether to pursue arbitrage opportunities.


We compare agent behavior under Ethereum’s default 12-second slot time environment with


a faster regime that offers 1-second subslot execution. The simulations, calibrated to Binance


and Uniswap v3 data from July to September 2025, show that faster slot times increase arbitrage


transaction count by 535% and trading volume by 203% on average.


The increase in CEX-DEX arbitrage activity under 1-second subslots is driven by the reduction


in variance of both successful and failed trade outcomes, increasing the risk-adjusted returns and


making CEX-DEX arbitrage more appealing.

### **1 Introduction**

One of the most active sources of DEX volume on Ethereum is arbitrage between centralized and


decentralized exchanges. The strategy is simple: when the prices between a CEX (e.g., Binance)


and a DEX (e.g., Uniswap) differ, a trader can exploit such an opportunity by simultaneously


buying on the cheaper venue and selling on the more expensive one, thus capturing the spread.


However, this strategy is not risk-free: while the CEX leg is executed almost instantaneously, the


DEX leg must wait for block inclusion, which is not guaranteed. DEX transactions can fail for


multiple reasons, such as insufficient priority fees, another trader capturing the same opportunity,


latency, or even the block builder censoring the transaction.


The risk of executing a DEX leg and its relationship to slot times is the focus of our paper.


We model a trading agent who knows that their on-chain transaction may fail to land and who


incorporates this uncertainty into their entry and exit decisions. The essence of the setup is as


follows: the agent faces a known probability _α_ of successfully executing the DEX leg, and if it fails,


they must decide how to manage their resulting delta exposure.


The motivation for the paper comes from the interest in understanding how Ethereum slot time


reduction would affect the largest portion of DEX volume. We consider a theoretical protocol that


operates in 1-second subslots, providing a faster feedback loop for traders compared to Ethereum’s


native 12-second slots. The question we address is: how does faster execution change arbitrageurs’


behavior, and what are the downstream effects on DEX activity?


**Related Literature.** _CEX-DEX Arbitrage Empirics._ A growing number of papers study the


scale and structure of cross-domain arbitrage between centralized and decentralized exchanges.


[1] provides a systematic analysis of CEX-DEX arbitrage on Ethereum, identifying over 157,000


arbitrage transactions between May and July 2023. Their research shows that nearly all CEX-DEX


arbitrages execute at the top of blocks, confirming that these opportunities require priority access.


The paper also documents significant market concentration: a single searcher (0xa69) captured


55.7% of all identified arbitrages, while beaverbuild dominated market share at 41.8%. Starting


from this foundation, [4] extends the analysis to 19 months of data (from August 2023 to March


2025), estimating the total extracted value of $233.8 million across 7.2 million CEX-DEX arbitrages.


Their findings reveal increasing centralization, with three searchers capturing three-quarters of both


volume and extracted value, and demonstrate that searcher profitability is tightly linked to vertical


integration with block builders.


The relationship between CEX-DEX arbitrage and block building competition is examined in


[3] and [5]. [3] shows that CeFi-DeFi arbitrage opportunities materially alter MEV-Boost auction


bid profiles, with builders who have access to CEX-DEX flow gaining decisive advantages during


periods of high volatility. [5] confirms that integrated high-frequency trading builders who extract


top-of-block opportunities are favored to win block auctions precisely when the price volatility


is increased, contributing to the observed concentration where three builders produce 80% of all


2


MEV-Boost blocks.


_Block Time and LP Losses_ . The theoretical relationship between block time and arbitrage losses


is formalized by the Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR) framework, which predicts that LP losses scale



_√_
with



_BT_, where _BT_ is block time. However, [2] extends this model to incorporate transaction



_√_
costs and shows that the



_BT_ -approximation breaks down on chains with significant base fees.



Their simulations show that when transaction costs are non-trivial, LP losses depend on multiple


interacting factors: base fees, swap fees, and block times, with the relative importance varying by


pool characteristics.


_Preconfirmations_ . Recent work has begun to formalize preconfirmations as a distinct service


layer in Ethereum’s execution pipeline. While preconfirmations represent the closest analog to our


theoretical protocol currently being researched, they differ fundamentally in scope: preconfirma

tions guarantee transaction inclusion but do not provide intermediate state commitments during


execution. The framework in [6] introduces a fulfillment-delivery paradigm borrowed from supply

chain logistics, in which specialized fulfillers (i.e., block builders) issue real-time commitments that


transactions will be included, while deliverers (i.e., validators) guarantee eventual on-chain confir

mation. Within this paradigm, preconfirmations are interpreted as a tool for reducing transaction


execution risk without requiring validator centralization, because economically specialized entities


(e.g., builders) can provide commitments while the underlying validator set remains decentralized


and compatible with solo staking.


Empirical evidence on the economic impact of preconfirmations for validators is still limited.


Using early mainnet data from August 2025, [7] measures how running preconfirmation services


affects realized block value and finds that, at the 75th percentile of blocks, validators with pre

confirmations observe higher block value than standard validators. However, the study emphasizes


that the sample is small and the results are not yet statistically significant.


An alternative line of work studies preconfirmations when validators themselves act as precon

firmation providers instead of relying on external gateway architectures. Under this assumption, [8]


shows that preconfirmations create new MEV capture channels and materially alter timing games:


searchers face heightened risk of early termination and therefore bid more aggressively earlier in


the block auction, which in turn incentivizes earlier transaction submission. The same work argues


that validators can preconfirm their own transactions to capture on-chain arbitrage and liquidation


opportunities, estimating that a validator with 1% stake penetration could earn roughly $345,600


in incremental annual MEV, representing about a 25% increase—higher than the current increase


from timing games that add roughly 10% to MEV revenue.


Finally, [9] analyzes whether execution preconfirmations can be made economically sustainable


for proposers relative to the current MEV-Boost regime. The paper models Dependent Sub-Slot


Auctions in which each preconfirmation depends on expected future block and preconfirmation


value, and shows that these auctions can increase expected proposer revenue even in the absence of

explicit preconfirmation-specific tips. In their design, a builder who preconfirms the N [th] transac

tion captures all subsequent revenue in the slot, effectively tying preconfirmation incentives to the


3


future flow of MEV.


**Our Contribution.** We complement the literature in two ways. First, unlike the empirical studies


that document realized arbitrage outcomes, we model the _decision-making_ problem facing a CEX

DEX arbitrageur under execution uncertainty. This perspective reveals why observed arbitrage


activity may substantially understate the latent demand for faster execution: many profitable


opportunities are foregone not because they do not exist but because rational agents decline to


attempt them given current confirmation times. Second, we focus on execution guarantees that


can be provided without protocol-level changes, making our analysis applicable to a range of possible


mechanism designs, including but not limited to preconfirmations.


Most importantly, we model a realistic trading agent who accounts for execution uncertainty.


This agent does not simply attempt every profitable opportunity. Instead, they evaluate the risk

adjusted expected value of entry, considering both the probability of DEX leg failure and the costs


of closing an unsuccessful position. This behavioral realism proves crucial for understanding how


faster execution affects market outcomes.


Our results show that faster execution substantially increases on-chain arbitrage activity. For


a risk-averse agent with 35% probability of landing the DEX leg, transaction counts increase by


535% when moving from 12-second to 1-second confirmation times. Volume increases by up to 203%.

### **2 DEX Price Interpolation**


The simulation framework models the interaction between centralized and decentralized exchange


prices over time. In this paper, we study the difference between confirmation intervals: under


Ethereum’s default configuration, DEX transactions can be executed every 12 seconds at slot


boundaries, while under faster execution regimes, transactions can be executed every second within


subslots. Historical DEX prices are readily available and can be used for 12-second slot benchmark


simulations. For a faster regime, we need a framework to interpolate these prices for 1-second


subslots.


Our framework includes three components. First, we start with a historical price for a current

slot. It is also a price for the initial subslot. Next, we derive a price _p_ [DEX] ( _ti_ ) of the _i_ -th subslot

from a price _p_ [DEX] ( _ti−_ 1) of the ( _i −_ 1)-th subslot. To do this, we apply (1) arbitrage transactions


from the previous slot if present, (2) CEX-DEX price reversion to model how DEX prices adjust to


off-chain information between arbitrage events, and (3) noise trading to capture non-arbitrage DEX


activity. Each component addresses a specific modeling challenge and, thus, we run simulations


with different combinations to assess robustness.


The subslot price interpolation mechanism is depicted in Figure 1. All other market mechanics


remain constant, allowing us to isolate the effect of confirmation speed.


We use data from July to September 2025, including millisecond-level best bid and ask prices

from Binance and all swap transactions from Uniswap v3 ETH-USDC pools at the 30 basis point,


5 basis point, and 1 basis point tiers.


**2.1** **Noise Trading**


It is known that arbitrageurs are not the only participants trading on DEXs. Hedgers, retail users,


and other non-arbitrage traders generate transaction flow that moves prices independently of CEX

DEX spreads. In order to include other market participants and avoid overstating the predictability


of DEX price movements, we incorporate ”noise trading”.


We classify historical Uniswap v3 transactions as either arbitrage or noise based on their char

acteristics. A trade is considered arbitrage if it satisfies all of the following four conditions: (1) it is


the first transaction in a block, (2) the pre-trade CEX-DEX price discrepancy exceeds the pool fee,


(3) the trade moves the DEX price toward the CEX price, and (4) the post-trade price discrepancy


remains equal to or above the pool fee. All other transactions are classified as noise.


From July to September 2025 data, we estimate probability distributions for both the number of


noise trades per block and the price impact of individual noise trades. Price impacts are rounded


to the nearest basis point, and observations with absolute impact exceeding 30 basis points are


excluded as outliers. During simulation, we sample a random number of noise trades with random


price impacts every 12 seconds and distribute them randomly across the DEX execution subslots.

**2.2** **CEX-DEX Price Reversion**


DEX prices can be adjusted toward CEX prices through channels other than direct arbitrage.


For example, informed traders may update their limit orders, or market makers may rebalance


inventory. In order to capture this gradual price convergence, we implement a regression-based


reversion mechanism.


The idea is to estimate how much the DEX price typically moves in response to a given CEX


price change and then use this relationship to revert DEX prices to CEX between arbitrage events.

Let _p_ [CEX] ( _t_ ) and _p_ [DEX] ( _t_ ) denote the CEX and DEX prices at time _t_ . Then, for consecutive times

tamps _ti−_ 1 and _ti_, define simple returns:



_ri_ [CEX] = _[p]_ [CEX][(] _[t][i]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ [CEX][(] _[t][i][−]_ [1][)]



_p_ [DEX] ( _ti−_ 1)




_[t][i]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ [CEX][(] _[t][i][−]_ [1][)]

_p_ [CEX] ( _ti−_ 1) _,_ _ri_ [DEX] = _[p]_ [DEX][(] _p_ _[t]_ [DEX] _[i]_ [)] _[ −]_ ( _[p]_ _t_ [DEX] _i−_ 1) [(] _[t][i][−]_ [1][)]



Then, we partition of the time axis into semi-open intervals _Fk_ = ( _τk−_ 1 _, τk_ ] and estimate a linear


model within each interval:


iid
_ri_ [DEX] = _β_ 0 [(] _[k]_ [)] + _β_ 1 [(] _[k]_ [)] _[r]_ _i_ [CEX] + _εi,_ _εi_ _∼N_ (0 _, σk_ [2][)]


The OLS estimate of the coefficients is as follows:







_β_ ˆ1 [(] _[k]_ [)] =




 - ( _r_ [CEX] _−_ _r_ ¯ _k_ [CEX] )( _r_ [DEX] _−_ _r_ ¯ _k_ [DEX] )

( _r_ [CEX] _,r_ [DEX] ) _∈Fk_




~~�~~ _k_ ( _r_ [CEX] _−_ _r_ ¯ _k_ [CEX] ) [2] _,_ _β_ ˆ0 [(] _[k]_ [)] = ¯ _rk_ [DEX] _−_ _β_ [ˆ] 1 [(] _[k]_ [)] _[r]_ [¯] _k_ [CEX]

( _r_ [CEX] _,r_ [DEX] ) _∈Fk_




~~�~~



For any timestamp _ti_ within interval _Fk_, where the CEX price is observed but the DEX price is


not yet updated, we predict:


_r_ ˆ _i_ [DEX] = _β_ [ˆ] 0 [(] _[k]_ [)] + _β_ [ˆ] 1 [(] _[k]_ [)] _[r]_ _i_ [CEX]


and obtain the reverted DEX price from the most recent observed DEX price _p_ [DEX] ( _ti−_ 1):


_p_ ˆ [DEX] ( _ti_ ) = _p_ [DEX] ( _ti−_ 1)(1 + ˆ _ri_ [DEX] )


It is also important to note that the coefficients are recalibrated at each interval boundary to allow


the CEX-DEX relationship to vary over time.

### **3 Modeling the Trading Agent**


CEX-DEX arbitrage exploits price discrepancies between centralized and decentralized exchanges.


When the DEX price is below the CEX bid, or above the CEX ask, an arbitrageur can buy on the


DEX and sell on the CEX, or vice versa, to capture the spread. The strategy, which is depicted in


Figure 2, appears straightforward, but the execution introduces significant complications.

The core risk is that the two legs of the trade are executed asynchronously. Assuming infinite


liquidity and instant and guaranteed execution on Binance, the CEX leg settlement bears no risks,


but the DEX leg needs to be included in a block. If the DEX transaction fails to land, due to


competition from other arbitrageurs, network congestion, among other reasons, the trader is left


with unhedged exposure. They have already committed to one side of the trade and must now


close out the position at potentially unfavorable prices.

updates continuously at millisecond frequency, while the DEX price (red line) updates only at 12-second
slot boundaries following arbitrage execution. Green regions represent opportunities to buy on DEX and
sell on CEX; orange regions represent the reverse direction.


We model an agent who explicitly accounts for this risk. The agent has a fixed probability


_α ∈_ (0 _,_ 1) of successfully landing the DEX leg of any attempted arbitrage. If the leg fails, the agent


must decide how to manage the resulting exposure: close immediately on the CEX, retry the DEX


trade in the next slot, or wait for better conditions. This fallback logic, combined with risk-averse


preferences over profit variance, determines which opportunities the agent chooses to pursue.


Throughout the paper, we consider the arbitrage strategy of buying _Q_ units on the DEX and

selling _Q_ units on the CEX [1] . Let _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t]_ [) and] _[ p]_ ask [CEX][(] _[t]_ [) denote the CEX bid and ask prices, and]

let _p_ [DEX] ( _tn_ ) denote the DEX price at slot _n_, where _tn_ = _nτ_ is the timestamp of slot _n_ and _τ_ is the


slot duration (i.e., 12 seconds by default, 1 second under faster execution). Key parameters include


the time step _δ_ (i.e., 1 second), the risk-aversion coefficient of the agent _λ_, and the minimum profit


threshold _θ_ for the entry.


1The opposite strategy of buying _Q_ units on the CEX and selling _Q_ units on the DEX has the same logic with
signs flipped. When the DEX price is above the CEX ask, one would buy on CEX and sell on DEX. So, we consider
the case mentioned above without loss of generality, as the other case is symmetric, and the logic remains the same.

**3.1** **Simple Model**


In the simple model, the agent attempts to take every detected arbitrage opportunity without


regard to execution risk. When an opportunity arises, which is defined as the CEX-DEX spread


exceeding the pool fee, the agent immediately submits both legs of the trade.


With probability _α_, the DEX leg lands successfully, and the agent captures the full arbitrage


profit:

_π_ _[s]_ = _Q_              - _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ [DEX][(] _[t][n]_ [)]              

With probability 1 _−_ _α_, the DEX leg fails. The agent has already sold on the CEX and must


now close the short position. In the simple model, we assume that the agent simply buys back on


the CEX one second later, paying the ask price and crossing the spread:


_π_ _[f]_ = _Q_             - _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ ask [CEX][(] _[t][n]_ [ +] _[ δ]_ [)]             

This model serves as a benchmark. In this setup, the agent’s behavior is mechanical, as they


act at every opportunity, so differences between 12-second and 1-second environments reflect only


the change in opportunity frequency, not any strategic adaptation.


**3.2** **Risk-Averse Model**


The risk-averse model endows the agent with two capabilities absent from the simple model: selec

tive entry based on risk-adjusted expected profit and optimal fallback decision when trades fail. In


this model, we study two main mechanisms: entry decision and fallback logic.


**Entry decision.** The agent enters an arbitrage opportunity only if the risk-adjusted expected


profit exceeds a threshold _θ_ . Let _π_ ( _tn_ ) denote the random profit from attempting arbitrage at slot


_n_ . Hence, the expected profit is as follows:


E� _π_ ( _tn_ ) _|Ftn_      - = _αQ_      - _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ [DEX][(] _[t][n]_ [)]      - + (1 _−_ _α_ )E� _V_ _[f]_ ( _tn,_ 1 _,_ 1) _|Ftn_      

where _V_ _[f]_ ( _tn,_ 1 _,_ 1) is the value function for the fallback problem, which will be defined below, and

_Ftn_ is the information set at time _tn_ . Next, we define _X_ _[s]_ = _Q_ - _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ [DEX][(] _[t][n]_ [)] - as the profit

conditional on success and _X_ _[f]_ = _V_ _[f]_ ( _tn,_ 1 _,_ 1) as the random profit conditional on failure. Hence,


the variance of profit is:


            Var� _π_ ( _tn_ ) _|Ftn_       - = _α_ (1 _−_ _α_ ) _X_ _[s]_ _−_ E� _X_ _[f]_ _|Ftn_       - [�][2] + (1 _−_ _α_ )Var� _X_ _[f]_ _|Ftn_       

Therefore, the agent enters if


~~�~~
E� _π_ ( _tn_ ) _|Ftn_            - _−_ _λ_ Var ~~�~~ _π_ ( _tn_ ) _|Ftn_ ~~�~~ _≥_ _θ_ (1)


8


**Fallback logic.** When the DEX leg fails, the agent holds an open CEX position that must eventu

ally be closed. At each decision point _tn_ + _k,m_ (at slot _n_ + _k_, subslot _m_ ) after _k_ failed DEX attempts,


the agent chooses among three options:


_1._ _Close immediately:_ Buy back on the CEX at the current ask price. Hence, the profit is


deterministic:

_π_ _[c]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) = _Q_           - _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ ask [CEX][(] _[t][n]_ [+] _[k,m]_ [)]           

_2. Retry on DEX:_ Submit a new DEX buy order at the current DEX price and wait for the next


slot. If the retry succeeds (with probability _α_ ):


_π_ _[r]_ [�] _tn_ + _k,m|Ln_ + _k_ = 1� = _Q_          - _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ [DEX][(] _[t][n]_ [+] _[k]_ [)]          

On the contrary, if the retry fails (with probability 1 _−_ _α_ ), the agent enters the fallback problem


again at the next slot with one additional failed attempt:


_π_ _[r]_ [�] _tn_ + _k,m|Ln_ + _k_ = 0� = _V_ _[f]_ ( _tn_ + _k_ +1 _,_ 0 _, k_ + 1)


That is, the expected profit from retrying equals:


E� _π_ _[r]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) _|Ftn_ + _k,m_  - = _αQ_  - _p_ [CEX] bid [(] _[t][n]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[p]_ [DEX][(] _[t][n]_ [+] _[k]_ [)]  - + (1 _−_ _α_ )E� _V_ _[f]_ ( _tn_ + _k_ +1 _,_ 0 _, k_ + 1) _|Ftn_ + _k,m_  

_3. Wait:_ Do nothing for one time step and reassess at _tn_ + _k,m_ +1:


_π_ _[w]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) = _V_ _[f]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ +1 _, k_ )


In the end, the agent selects the option with the highest risk-adjusted utility:


_u_ _[c]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) = _π_ _[c]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ )


~~�~~
_u_ _[r]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) = E� _π_ _[r]_ [�] _tn_ + _k,m_ ) _|Ftn_ + _k,m_       - _−_ _λ_ Var ~~�~~ _π_ _[r]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) _|Ftn_ + _k,m_ ~~�~~


~~�~~
_u_ _[w]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) = E� _π_ _[w]_ [�] _tn_ + _k,m_ ) _|Ftn_ + _k,m_       - _−_ _λ_ Var ~~�~~ _π_ _[w]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) _|Ftn_ + _k,m_ ~~�~~


Hence, the value function is as follows:


_V_ _[f]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m, k_ ) = max� _u_ _[c]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) _, u_ _[r]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ ) _, u_ _[w]_ ( _tn_ + _k,m_ )� (2)


subject to constraints: retry is only available if there is sufficient time before slot end ( _m ≤_ _M −M_ [¯] ),

wait is only available within a slot ( _m < M_ ), and after _k_ [¯] failed attempts, the agent must close.


The fallback logic is depicted in Figure 3.

Recursion proceeds in two nested loops: an outer loop over failed attempts ( _k_ = _k_ [¯] _−_ 1 _, ...,_ 0) and


an inner loop over subslots within each slot ( _m_ = _M, ...,_ 0). At each state, we simulate _N_ price


paths to estimate the expectation and variance of each option, and then select the option with the


highest risk-adjusted utility.

### **4 Simulation Design**

The simulation models the competitive dynamics between agents operating CEX-DEX arbitrage


bots. Agent 1 represents the participant whose behavior we analyze in detail, while Agent 2


represents the aggregate behavior of all other market participants. The two agents compete for


arbitrage opportunities, but only one can successfully execute the DEX leg of any given trade.


When an arbitrage opportunity arises, multiple agents might attempt to capture it, but blockchain


constraints ensure only one transaction can succeed. When Agent 1 attempts an opportunity, they


win with probability _α_ . When Agent 1 fails or chooses not to attempt to land their DEX transac

tion, Agent 2 automatically succeeds and captures the arbitrage profit. Conversely, when Agent 1


succeeds, Agent 2’s transaction fails.


This competitive structure introduces execution risk that fundamentally shapes agent behav

ior. In the simple model, both agents attempt every detected opportunity regardless of expected


outcomes. In the risk-averse model, Agent 1 evaluates each opportunity’s risk-adjusted expected


value before entering, while Agent 2 continues to pursue all opportunities. When Agent 1 declines


to enter based on unfavorable risk-return characteristics, Agent 2 captures the arbitrage. Agent 2


represents a simplified aggregate of market participants who close failed positions immediately on


the CEX, while Agent 1 employs the risk-averse fallback logic described in Section 3.2, potentially


waiting for better conditions or retrying on the DEX.


The core objective of the simulation is to quantify how faster execution guarantees change ar

bitrageur behavior and market outcomes. For each of the four configurations listed below, we run


parallel simulations under two execution regimes. In the 12-second execution regime, DEX transac

tions can only be executed at Ethereum slot boundaries, occurring every 12 seconds: this represents


the simple environment where arbitrageurs face substantial execution windows and corresponding


uncertainty. In the 1-second execution regime, DEX transactions can be executed every second


through subslot confirmations: this represents the improved environment where arbitrageurs re

ceive faster execution guarantees.


**Configuration Space.** We evaluate agent behavior across multiple environmental configurations


to assess the robustness of our findings. Each configuration combines two binary design choices


that capture different aspects of market microstructure.


The first choice is CEX-DEX price reversion. When enabled, subslot DEX prices gradually


adjust toward CEX prices between arbitrage events using the regression-based mechanism described


in Section 2.2. This captures informed trading that occurs independently of direct arbitrage.


The second choice is noise trading. When enabled, the simulation incorporates random non

arbitrage transactions whose frequency and price impact are sampled from empirical distributions


estimated from data. This captures retail flow and other trading activity unrelated to CEX-DEX


arbitrage.


These two binary choices yield four distinct configurations, ranging from a minimal environment


11


with no reversion and no noise, to an environment incorporating both components. The results of


these configurations are then compared to an agent with the current 12-second confirmation interval.


**Key assumptions.** The simulation relies on several key assumptions. On the execution side: all


validators are opted in to providing fast execution guarantees; hence, there are no missed slots,


and DEX transactions can occur every second; gas fees are zero; agents cannot run out of capital,


meaning liquidity constraints do not affect execution, and there are no fees other than DEX pool


fees. On the arbitrage side: every top-of-block arbitrage opportunity is executed; arbitrages are


executed with the optimal trade size, moving the DEX price to one pool fee from CEX bid or ask;


infinite liquidity exists at the best bid and ask on Binance, and execution on Binance is instant and


guaranteed. On market structure: DEX pools are constant-product (Uniswap v2-style); liquidity


is constant except for the increase from swap fees, and all pools start with identical initial liquidity


for comparability.


**Parameters.** For parameters used by both models, Agent 1’s winning probability is set to _α_ = 0 _._ 35,


and the CEX-DEX reversion interval window is 300 seconds. For parameters specific to the risk

averse model, the risk-aversion coefficient is _λ_ = 0 _._ 01, the entry threshold is _θ_ = 0, and Monte


Carlo estimation uses 16 paths at each node. The decision wait horizon is 3 seconds, and the maxi

mum wait time is also 3 seconds. Robustness tests vary _α ∈{_ 0 _._ 20 _,_ 0 _._ 35 _,_ 0 _._ 50 _}_ and _λ ∈{_ 0 _,_ 0 _._ 01 _,_ 0 _._ 03 _}_ .


**Combined effect of changes.** To assess the overall impact across all three pools, we compute a


weighted average of the pool-specific changes in transaction counts and volume. The weights reflect


each pool’s historical share of arbitrage activity during the observation period. For transaction


counts, the 30, 5, and 1 basis point pools represent 3.7%, 33.1%, and 63.2% of total arbitrage


transactions, respectively. For trading volume, these pools account for 28.6%, 50.3%, and 21.1% of


total arbitrage volume, respectively.

### **5 Results**


We examine the impact of reducing the confirmation interval from 12 seconds to 1 second on trans

action frequency and trading volume across different configurations and fee-tier pools, comparing


simple and risk-averse agent models. All reported ranges reflect aggregated results across all fee


levels and configurations for an agent with a 35% probability of successfully executing a DEX leg.


**Transaction Frequency.** We measure transaction frequency as the number of transactions landed


by the agent. In the simple model, transaction counts increase substantially across all pools. Across


all configurations and fee tiers, the simple model exhibits increases ranging from 218% to 663%.


The risk-averse model exhibited an even greater increase in transaction frequency, with a trans

action count increase ranging from 294% to 1386%. However, it is important to note that most


12


scenarios fall below an increase of 600% with the 1386% being present in a single configuration


where, while the percentage change is big, the absolute number of transactions is quite small.


The pattern across fee tiers reflects the economics of arbitrage at different spread levels. Lower

fee pools have tighter spreads and more marginal opportunities. Under a 12-second confirmation,


many of these opportunities are not worth pursuing because the execution window is long enough


that adverse price moves can wipe out the slim profit margin. Under 1-second confirmation, the


risk is compressed, and more marginal opportunities become viable.


The weighted average of transaction number increase across different pools varies between 356%


and 412% for the simple model depending on the configuration, with the average of noise with and


without reversion configurations being 371%. Similarly, for the risk-averse model, the weighted


increase varies between 378% and 567%, with the average of two configurations being 535%.


**Trading Volume.** Trading volume, measured in terms of Ethereum, shows more nuanced patterns


than changes in number of transactions. In the simple model, the volume changes exhibit increases


ranging from 98% to 273% depending on the configuration. Similarly to the trading frequency, the


increase is closer to the lower end of the range for the 30 basis point pool and closer to the higher


end for the 5 and 1 basis point pools. The risk-averse model showed similar patterns with increases


ranging from 121% to 375%.


The volume increases are concentrated in lower-fee pools. The intuition here is as follows:


when more marginal opportunities become viable, the average trade size may fall (as marginal


opportunities tend to have smaller optimal trade sizes), but the total number of trades increases by


enough to raise aggregate volume. In higher-fee pools, where opportunities are already large and


infrequent, faster confirmations do not as dramatically expand the viable opportunity set.


It is important to note that these ranges represent outcomes under different configurations;


however, since gas fees are not incorporated into the model, the upper bounds of these ranges


might overestimate the increase for the 1-basis-point and 5-basis-point pools, where the economic


viability of frequent small transactions would be constrained by transaction costs in practice.


When weighing the volume increases based on the arbitrage volume across different pools, the


average increase in volume for the three pools varies between 148% and 211% for the simple model,


with the average being 168%. Similarly, for the risk-averse model, the overall increase varies be

tween 159% and 243%, with the average being 203%.


**Robustness Tests.** To assess the robustness of these findings, we conducted an additional set of


simulations for the risk-averse model under the reversion and noise trading configuration. We varied


Agent 1’s win probability _α ∈{_ 0 _._ 20 _,_ 0 _._ 35 _,_ 0 _._ 50 _}_ and the risk aversion parameter _λ ∈{_ 0 _,_ 0 _._ 01 _,_ 0 _._ 03 _}_,


and compared outcomes when the confirmation interval is reduced from 12 seconds to 1 second.


In the 5 basis point pool, across all combinations in this grid, transaction counts increased by


416–530%, and ETH trading volume increased by 146–186%. In the 30 basis point pool, transaction


counts increased by 1152–1468%, and ETH volume changes ranged between a 317% increase and


13


a 385% increase. Overall, changes in transaction counts and volume are of the same magnitude


when comparing agents with identical parameters under 12-second versus 1-second confirmation


intervals, suggesting that the main results are robust to reasonable variations in win probability


and risk aversion.

### **6 Conclusion**

This paper examines how reducing blockchain execution times affects decentralized exchange activ

ity, focusing on the behavior of CEX-DEX arbitrageurs. Our contribution is as much methodological


as empirical: we develop a simulation framework combining empirical price anchoring, noise-trading


dynamics, CEX–DEX arbitrage mechanics, and a risk-averse decision model. The agent we model


takes execution risk seriously, incorporating DEX transaction uncertainty into both entry decisions


and fallback strategies. This setup captures a fundamental reality of on-chain trading that prior


work has largely abstracted away.


Under reasonable assumptions about agent risk preferences and inclusion probabilities, the


shift from a 12-second to a 1-second execution environment increases the number of arbitrage


transactions by 535%, with effects concentrated in lower-fee pools where marginal opportunities


become newly viable. Faster execution also reduces profit variance by compressing the window for


adverse price moves during failed-trade recovery.


Several limitations are worth mentioning. Our model assumes zero gas fees, which may overstate


the viability of small trades in low-fee pools. Also, the agent’s probability of landing DEX trades is


fixed rather than endogenously determined by competition; in equilibrium, faster execution might


attract more arbitrageurs and compress _α_ . These extensions remain for future work.
