I. INTRODUCTION

HE past decade has witnessed tremendous advances in
artificial intelligence (AI) [1]. In particular, multi-layer
# **T**
artificial neural networks (ANNs), inspired by the architecture
of biological neural networks in the human brain, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in a wide range of applications,
such as computer vision [2], speech recognition [3], and
natural language processing [4]. An ANN is composed of
artificial neurons that are typically aggregated into layers,

with connections to other neurons in adjacent layers through
synaptic edges. Each artificial neuron processes the signals it
receives from connected neurons and sends a signal to the
downstream neurons [5]. By training the connection weights
of each edge in a data-driven manner, ANNs acquire the ability
to learn abstract features of the input data, enabling them to
handle complex tasks.
Analog electromagnetic computing (or wave-domain computing) has also gained considerable attention in recent years
due to its ability to efficiently tackle complex mathematical
operations, such as spatial integration, differentiation, and
convolution, as well as solving equations by leveraging the
propagation of waves within custom-designed material slabs
or cavities [6]. Electromagnetic computing has been found
to significantly enhance the information processing efficiency
compared to conventional computing paradigms, thanks to its
unique characteristics of light-speed operation, low energy
consumption, and scalability for massively parallel processing [7]. Recent research studies have showcased the substantial
potential of electromagnetic computing in various practical
scenarios [6], particularly in high-volume real-time data processing scenarios, such as augmented reality and autonomous
driving.
Additionally, the rapidly advancing field of engineered
metamaterials has led to the emergence of programmable
metasurfaces and information metasurfaces [8], [9]. A metasurface is essentially an artificial planar surface composed
of periodically arranged subwavelength scattering metaatoms [10], [11]. By tuning external stimuli, such as mechanical deformation or bias voltage using field programmable gate
arrays (FPGA), each individual meta-atom can independently
modulate the phase and/or amplitude of incident electromagnetic waves [12], [13]. This breakthrough technology has
opened up new possibilities for manipulating electromagnetic
wavefronts at an unprecedented scale to achieve a wide range
of functionalities, spanning from planar hologram generation
to the customization of communication environments [14].
The fusion of neural network architectures with electromagnetic computing has catalyzed the development of diffractive
neural networks (DNNs) [15]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a DNN
is implemented using a number of densely packed diffractive
layers, with free-space propagation between them. In a dielectric diffractive layer, the thickness of each individual pixel (or
neuron) is a learnable variable that can be adjusted to control
the transmission coefficient [15]. After adequate training and

fabrication using three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques,
a DNN can carry out specific functions through the interactions of electromagnetic waves within the diffractive layers.
Various advanced DNN architectures have been reported in
the recent literature, demonstrating impressive capabilities in
many emerging applications, including image classification
and reconstruction [16], real-time object detection [17], and
matrix inversion [18].

However, DNNs constructed with passive diffractive layers
have a significant limitation: once they are fabricated, they
cannot be retrained to perform other tasks. This restriction
severely hinders their potential for widespread deployment.
Fortunately, the emergence of programmable metasurfaces
provides the missing piece of the puzzle to create reconfigurable DNNs [19]. As shown in Fig. 1, by stacking several
intelligent metasurfaces into a single device, a new technology
is conceived, which is referred to as a stacked intelligent
metasurface (SIM) [20], [21]. In a SIM, each intelligent metasurface functions as a layer of a DNN, and each programmable
meta-atom is analogous to a neuron with learnable phase and
amplitude responses, which can be adjusted to accommodate
the requirements of diverse tasks in dynamic environments.
Consequently, a SIM inherits the powerful representation
capabilities of ANNs, the ultra-fast speed of electromagnetic
computing, as well as the energy-efficient electromagnetic
tuning capability of programmable metasurfaces [21].

SIMs represent a revolutionary and transformative technology that has the potential to fundamentally reshape the future
of communication, sensing, and computing. In this article,
we provide a comprehensive overview of SIM technology,
examining its vast potential and the fundamental challenges
in its practical applications. Specifically, our contributions are
summarized below:


1) We commence by elucidating the fundamental SIM



principles, encompassing its physical architecture and
neural network counterparts. We further present a comprehensive review of advances in SIM prototype development. The configuration (or training, in DNN jargon)
strategies for SIM are also examined from two different
perspectives.
2) We critically appraise the applications of SIM in communication, sensing, and computing systems, presenting
experimental findings that demonstrate the distinctive
advantages of SIM technology. Additionally, the promising potential for integrating communication, sensing,
and computing functionalities within a unified SIM
framework is discussed to enable emerging applications.
3) We shed light on both the substantial opportunities and
critical challenges inherent in translating the innovative
SIM concept into a practical technology, addressing considerations in modeling, protocol design, and potential
energy efficiency concerns. Furthermore, we provide
insights into pathways for enhancing both the signal
processing and inference capabilities of SIMs.

To outline our exploration of SIM technology, the structure
of this article is illustrated in Fig. 2.


II. ELECTROMAGNETIC FOUNDATION OF SIM


From a physical perspective, a SIM is constructed by stacking multiple layers of reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces. According to the Huygens–Fresnel principle [19], each
meta-atom on a metasurface layer functions as a secondary
source, producing a spherical wave that illuminates all the
meta-atoms on the next layer. The phase and amplitude of
the diffracted secondary wave that impinges on the next
layer are jointly determined by the electromagnetic waves
impinging upon the meta-atoms on the current layer, by the
complex-valued transmission coefficients of the current layer,

impinges upon each meta-atom on a metasurface layer is
the sum of the fields refracted by all the meta-atoms on the
previous layer [20].

The architecture of a SIM is similar to that of an ANN.
Explicitly, both consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer [19], [25]. In a SIM, each
hidden layer is essentially a metasurface, which is a dense
array of electronically programmable meta-atoms that function similarly to artificial neurons in a conventional digital
ANN. The meta-atoms on different layers are interconnected
through the diffraction of electromagnetic waves. In principle,
each meta-atom in a SIM can potentially impact any other
meta-atom. However, in practical SIM devices, anti-reflective
coatings can be utilized to suppress unwanted back-and-forth
reflections and limit the electromagnetic coupling between
non-adjacent layers [17]. As a result, a SIM is equivalent
to a feed-forward diffraction device, where electromagnetic
waves propagate from one layer to the next. In contrast to
conventional ANNs, the complex-valued connection weights,
or propagation coefficients, between metasurface layers in
a SIM are not individually trainable [15]. Instead, they are
explicitly dictated by the propagation direction and the axial
spacing between layers. The trainable network parameters in a
SIM-based DNN are the transmission coefficients of the metaatoms at specific lattice coordinates [18].

A SIM fundamentally represents a synergistic integration
of three interdisciplinary technologies: neural networks, electromagnetic computing, and information metasurfaces [14].
As illustrated in Fig. 3, these three cutting-edge technologies
exhibit complementary strengths that address each other’s
inherent limitations. Conventional neural networks, while powerful, depend on digital chips that incur substantial computational overhead and energy consumption [5]. Metasurfaces,
despite their sophisticated wavefront manipulation capabilities,
possess limited signal processing functionality [8]. Similarly,
existing electromagnetic computing paradigms suffer from
constrained tunability and poor scalability [6]. A SIM circumvents these limitations by synthesizing the distinct advantages

Furthermore, _A_ is the area of each meta-atom, _ζn,_ _[l]_ _n_ ˜ [represents]

1The propagation model in (1) allows us to account for near-field propagation between adjacent metasurface layers, but it can be applied provided that
some physical conditions are fulfilled. Notably, the (sub-wavelength) interlayer distance cannot be too small, so as to ensure that (1) is physically
consistent. As a rule of thumb, the inter-layer distance, given the size of
meta-atoms, should be sufficiently large to ensure that the amplitude of (1) is
less than one [24].

of electromagnetic waves, completing this potent tripartite
amalgam.

carrying electromagnetic waves in free space, it can execute
desired computation tasks without requiring any digital storage, transmission, pre-processing of information, as well as
external computing power [14]. Most remarkably, information
processing within a SIM takes place at the speed of light [20].
Additionally, a SIM can be readily scaled up to accommodate
extremely large-scale inputs and a plethora of connections in
a cost-effective and power-efficient manner [19]. Thanks to
these distinctive advantages, several advanced SIMs have been
designed to carry out various tasks in the wave domain [15],

[16], [19], [26]–[29]. For a more detailed overview, Table I
provides a comprehensive review of existing SIM prototypes,
including their functions and corresponding hardware parameters, to guide practical SIM designs.


III. CONFIGURATION OF SIMS


As previously mentioned, designing a well-configured SIM
is crucial for it to perform the intended functions and complete
a given inference task [14]. In this section, we elaborate on
potential strategies conceived for optimizing and training the
transmission coefficients of SIMs from two different perspectives.


_A. Roles of a SIM_


As shown in Fig. 4, one can distinguish two primary roles
for a SIM according to whether the transformation desired is
known or unknown.


_•_ **Mathematical Function Approximation:** In certain application scenarios, the desired transformation matrix –
such as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) used in
spectral analysis – is known in advance [31]. In these



cases, a SIM can be employed to approximate the desired
function by tuning the transmission coefficients of multiple metasurface layers. While a digital signal processor
can achieve the same function, the utilization of a SIM allows one to achieve near-instantaneous computing, thanks
to its electromagnetic-domain signal processing [20]. In
general, the approximation of desired functions imposes
lower requirements on reconfigurability. Therefore, the
SIM may only have to be reconfigured on a relatively
long timescale [14], [31].

_•_ **Black Box:** In most practical applications, however, such
as image classification, the target transformation is often
unknown [17]. In these scenarios, a SIM can be optimized
as a “black box.” By feeding it with a large number of
training samples, the complex-valued transmission coefficients within the SIM can be iteratively adjusted based
on their gradients with respect to a custom-designed loss
function tailored to the specific task [16]. Since SIMs
are physically assembled subject to diverse fabrication
constraints imposed on phase and amplitude modulation,
the transmission coefficients have to be quantized to
feasible values that can be practically implemented by
individual meta-atoms [19].


_B. Training Methods_


From the perspective of the training process, the transmission coefficients can be trained using either computer
simulations or directly on a physical SIM device, as indicated
in Fig. 5.


_•_ **Computer Simulation:** Similar to an ANN, the training
of a SIM can be executed on a computer. Once the
transmission coefficients are trained to achieve a satisfactory level of approximation accuracy or inference performance, they are deployed on the SIM [15]. Although
the training time is constrained by the processing power
of the digital computer, the forward propagation during
the inference stage occurs at the speed of light. However,
computer simulations also pose significant challenges,
as they require a reliable mathematical model or simulation tool that can instantly and accurately quantify
the complex interactions of wave propagation within the
SIM. While established numerical methods, such as the
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and finiteelements method (FEM), offer high accuracy, there is still
potential for improving their simulation speed [29].

_•_ **In Situ Training:** In practice, hardware implementations
of metasurfaces may diverge from their numerical models
due to deformations that occur during the manufacturing
process and undesired misalignments between layers.
This may lead to inaccurate inference outcomes. To
address this issue, an alternative approach known as in
situ training has shown considerable potential [32], [33].
Since the training and inference processes share the same
electromagnetic responses, any fabrication imperfections
and mechanical misalignments are implicitly accounted
for during the training phase, resulting in minimal impact
on the inference results. Additionally, the training time is

substantially reduced, because the forward propagation
of signals occurs at the speed of light [19]. Moreover, in
situ training enables the application of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) strategies [34], which can train the transmission coefficients based on practical observations in
a dynamic environment. However, in situ training needs
real-time feedback from the output, which introduces
extra signaling overhead when the SIM is deployed far
from the inference receiver [20].

Once appropriately configured, SIMs can be utilized to
perform a variety of inference tasks by directly processing
information carried by electromagnetic waves. To elaborate
on the unique capabilities of SIMs, we next provide a critical
appraisal of its potential applications in communication (Sec.
IV), sensing (Sec. V), and computing (Sec. VI) systems.


IV. SIMS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS


In wireless communication systems, modulation, filtering,
and beamforming are particularly crucial for effectively conveying information, for shaping desired signal waveforms, and
for directing beams toward intended users [35]. As a promising
alternative to traditional baseband processing techniques, SIMs
can accomplish these tasks more efficiently in the wave
domain.


_A. MIMO Precoding_


In the pioneering work [20], a pair of SIMs was employed
at the transmitter and receiver for automatically implementing



multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding and combining, as the electromagnetic waves propagate through the
well-configured metasurfaces. With the use of SIMs, MIMO
transceivers can eliminate the need for complex matrix multiplications in the digital domain. This substantially reduces processing latency, hardware costs, and energy usage compared to
conventional MIMO systems [20]. Furthermore, the hardware
complexity can be reduced by transforming complex multistream detection schemes into parallel single-stream detection
schemes. Building on this concept, the authors of [36], [37]
applied the SIM-based transceiver design concept to multiuser
multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communications. In this scenario, a SIM was integrated with the radome
of the base station (BS) to carry out transmit beamforming
directly in the electromagnetic wave domain. To maximize the
sum rate of all users, an optimization problem was formulated
by jointly optimizing transmit power allocation and analog
beamforming in the wave domain, subject to constraints on
the transmit power budget and phase shifts. By decomposing
the joint optimization problem into two sub-problems, the
power allocation sub-problem was addressed using the popular
iterative water-filling algorithm, while the SIM was configured through successive refinement for discrete phase shift
tuning [37] and gradient ascent (GA) for continuous phase
shift tuning [36].


To illustrate the associated conceptual differences, Fig. 6
contrasts a conventional MIMO system with a SIM-based
MIMO system. In conventional MIMO communication systems, multiple data streams are superimposed by a digital

corresponding antennas, without interfering with each other.

precoder at the baseband before transmission [35]. However, this process produces signals having high peak-toaverage power ratios (PAPR), which, in turn, necessitate highresolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-todigital converters (ADCs) for accurate processing. Moreover,
the resultant high PAPR reduces the efficiency of power amplifiers (PA) at the transmitter and low-noise amplifiers (LNA)
at the receiver [14]. By contrast, SIM-based MIMO systems
perform transmit precoding and receive combining in the wave
domain, thereby eliminating the need for digital precoding
and combining [20]. As a consequence, each antenna only
transmits a single data stream. When employing low-order
modulation schemes, low-resolution DACs and ADCs become
adequate, since the modulated waveforms typically exhibit low
PAPRs. In addition, the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains
in SIM-based systems is reduced to match the number of data
streams (or users), leading to significant reductions in both
hardware cost and energy consumption [21], [22].


Additionally, Fig. 7 illustrates the actions of an end-toend MIMO channel utilizing the SIM-based architecture of
Fig. 6(b). A pair of SIMs is employed to mitigate interference
among five data streams. The system operates at 28 GHz.
Moreover, each metasurface consists of 10 _×_ 10 meta-atoms
arranged with half-wavelength spacing. The axial spacing
between adjacent metasurface layers is set to one wavelength,
while all other simulation parameters are consistent with those
outlined in [21]. The transmission coefficients of the transmitting and receiving SIMs are optimized using the gradient
descent (GD) method described in [20]. As seen from Fig. 7,
by utilizing an adequate number of metasurface layers, it



becomes possible to create multiple interference-free channels,
even in the absence of digital precoding and combining.
Over the past few years, the concept of utilizing SIMs to
implement precoding in the wave domain has gained considerable attention and has been applied to various communication
systems [60]. Next, we will review the notable progress in this
area from three key perspectives.


_•_ **From Far-Field Communications to Near-Field Com-**
**munications:** In order to simultaneously achieve high
data throughput and massive connectivity in nextgeneration wireless networks, extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) and metasurfaces are expected
to be widely deployed [61]. As a consequence, wireless communications will predominantly operate in the
radiating near-field region. Although the fundamental
system design and signal processing techniques for nearfield and far-field communications are similar, the unique
characteristics of spherical wavefronts in near-field propagation offer enhanced spatial multiplexing gain [61],

[62]. Furthermore, in addition to angular selectivity, they
also allow ‘spot-light-like’ beam-focusing to a specific
location, hence allowing for the distinction of users in
the distance domain. However, this advantage necessitates
complex matrix operations for baseband beamfocusing
at the transmitter, which can lead to high computational
complexity and processing delays when using ELAAs or
metasurfaces. In this context, applying a SIM to perform
near-field beamfocusing in the wave domain becomes increasingly appealing. Building on this idea, Jia _et al._ [63]
explored the potential of SIMs in multiuser MISO near

field communications, where a SIM was integrated into
the radome of a BS to perform beamfocusing through
wave manipulation. They employed a GD algorithm to
configure the transmission coefficients of a SIM and customize an end-to-end channel that minimizes interference
among users. Moreover, the authors of [64] formulated an
optimization problem aimed at maximizing the weighted
sum rate of multiple near-field users by jointly designing
the transmit power allocation and the phase shifts of the

then applied to solve this problem.

with frequency. However, unlike single-layer metasurfaces that maintain a frequency-flat profile, SIMs can produce frequency-selective transfer functions thanks to their
multiple internal propagation paths. Inspired by this characteristic, Li _et al._ [43] explored the application of SIMs
for fully-analog beamforming in MIMO-aided orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems, which aims to achieve interference-free
transmission across a broad frequency range. To achieve
this, they employed a GD algorithm to determine the
optimal SIM configuration and examined the relationship
between the maximum effective transmission bandwidth
and various physical parameters of the SIM, such as
the number of metasurface layers and the metasurface
aperture. Their numerical results demonstrated that optimizing the SIM for multiple frequency sub-carriers

 - rather than only the center frequency – significantly
improved the channel capacity of SIM-aided MIMOOFDM communication systems. Furthermore, in [67],
the same authors adopted index modulation (IM)-aided
OFDM as the transmission waveform to illuminate SIM.
In OFDM-IM, information is conveyed by selectively activating a subset of available subcarriers, with the specific
indices of these active subcarriers implicitly conveying
additional bits. This transmission strategy offers two key
advantages: firstly, the selective subcarrier activation inherently reduces the PAPR of the broadband transmission
waveform; secondly, the sparse subcarrier multiplexing
among multiple users effectively expands the operational
bandwidth over which a SIM can function effectively.
To assess system reliability, the worst-case bit error rate
(BER) was adopted as the performance metric, and a deep
unfolding framework was developed for configuring the
SIM parameters, while adaptively adjusting the step size
at each iteration.

_•_ **From Single BS to Multiple BSs:** The capacity of
wireless networks can be enhanced by deploying more
BSs or access points (APs); however, this approach also
increases both the hardware costs and energy consump


tion accordingly [68]. To tackle this challenge, recent
studies have investigated the integration of low-cost SIMs
with APs in cell-free massive MIMO systems. In downlink scenarios, Hu _et al._ [69] developed a method that
jointly optimizes AP power allocation and SIM-based
wave-domain beamforming to maximize the sum rate.
For uplink applications, Shi _et al._ [41], [70] developed
a two-stage transmission framework. The first stage employs a greedy algorithm to minimize interference among
pilot signals during channel estimation. In the second
stage, the SIM is configured to achieve wave-domain
beamforming, and a power allocation algorithm is developed for maximizing the worst-case spectral efficiency
of user equipment (UE). Additionally, Li _et al._ [71]
optimized the SIM coefficients for accurately recovering
the symbols for each UE. The central processing unit
(CPU) then combined the local detection results using
weights designed based on the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) criteria, taking into account the impact
of hardware impairments. These studies demonstrate that
increasing the number of metasurface layers can significantly reduce inter-user interference by effectively
leveraging wave manipulation. More recently, Park _et_
_al._ [72] proposed a hybrid beamforming approach that
combines wave-domain beamforming through SIMs with
standard digital processing. Specifically, an optimization
framework was developed for jointly configuring the
digital beamforming, wave-domain beamforming, and
fronthaul compression for maximizing the weighted sumrate of both the uplink and downlink, when fronthaul
capacity is limited.

To further illustrate the benefits of SIM-based MIMO systems, Table II compares the number of RF chains required
and the computational complexity involved in implementing
beamforming in these communication systems versus their
conventional counterparts. As shown in Table II, the utilization
of SIM not only facilitates efficient beamforming in the wave
domain but also significantly reduces both the hardware costs
and computation demands. Moreover, recent research has

also explored the integration of SIM with other emerging
wireless technologies, such as DRL [47], [48], [51], [73]–[75],
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) [52], [55], [56], rate
splitting multiple access (RSMA) [76], [77], and unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV) [57], [58]. Other sophisticated applications include physical layer security (PLS) [59], [78], nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) [79], and simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [80], by
taking advantage of the capability of SIM to efficiently process
signals in the wave domain. To provide a comprehensive understanding of these recent advances from a mathematical perspective, Table III summarizes typical optimization problem
formulations, including the popular optimization objectives,
key optimization variables, constraints, as well as common
solvers. Additionally, the relevant mathematical symbols and
their definitions are listed in Table IV.


_B. Semantic Encoding_

Semantic communication is a promising paradigm that
can significantly enhance communication efficiency. In taskoriented semantic communication systems, a SIM can be
utilized as a semantic encoder. For example, the authors of [81]
demonstrated this concept by investigating a classification
task in which a SIM was strategically positioned before the
transmit antenna. The input layer of the SIM was utilized for
source encoding, while the remaining layers formed a DNN
for semantic encoding, which aims for transforming the signals
traversing the input layer into a unique beam directed toward
the receiving antenna corresponding to a specific class. In
contrast to conventional communication systems that transmit
modulated signals containing either encoded information or
compressed semantic information, the transmit antenna of
SIM-based semantic communication systems simply emits unmodulated electromagnetic carrier waves [81]. At the receiver,
the image class is recognized by probing the signal magnitude
distributions across the receiving array, which substantially



reduces the required signal processing complexity. Notably,
both the source and semantic encoding occur automatically
as the electromagnetic waves propagate through the stratified
structure. By adopting a similar philosophy, Liu _et al._ [82]
developed a disaster recognition method that consists of a SIM
mounted on a drone to process semantic information encoded
in electromagnetic waves, while dissipating low energy and
at extremely fast speeds. At the ground station, the electronic
network further processes the received signals to improve the
system’s ability to make more accurate disaster predictions.
When transmitting complex visual scenes, existing semantic communication systems encounter challenges related to
substantial data transmission demands. To address this issue,
Huang _et al._ [83] leveraged a SIM placed in front of the transmit antenna to convey visual edge information from intricate
scenes by directly mapping them using imaging techniques
onto the receiver array, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Complementary
textual scene descriptions are transmitted using traditional
amplitude and phase modulation techniques. To realize the
desired function, a customized mini-batch GD algorithm was
developed for fine-tuning the transmission coefficients of
meta-atoms within the SIM, thereby minimizing discrepancies
between the received and desired visual patterns. Subsequently, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN)
processes the received visual patterns and text descriptions to
reconstruct the complex original scene.


V. SIM FOR SENSING


Wireless sensing is essential for acquiring critical information about targets of interest. Typical sensing applications encompass direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, object recognition, as well as target detection and tracking. In contrast to
traditional sensing algorithms that rely on specific models and
cannot meet real-time processing requirements, SIM provides
a universal framework for extracting information by directly
processing radio waves.

_A. Object Recognition_


Substantial research efforts have established that SIM has
great potential in executing object recognition tasks [15], [19].
Building upon this foundation, Luo _et al._ [17] fabricated
an advanced polarization-multiplexed SIM that operates in
the visible spectrum, which demonstrates the capability to
simultaneously perform dual recognition tasks: identifying
handwritten digits and classifying fashionable items by using
distinct polarization channels. As shown in Fig. 9, this innovative dual-channel object classification framework consists of
three primary components:


_• Input layer:_ A plane wave with appropriately engineered
phase and amplitude distribution is used for encoding the
object information across multiple channels.

_• Hidden layers:_ Each hidden layer contains asymmetric
meta-atoms with tunable birefringence characteristics.

_• Output layer:_ The physical output plane is partitioned into
several discrete detection regions, each corresponding to
a particular object category.

By employing an error backpropagation approach, the multidimensional phase distributions are progressively updated,
and, eventually, much of the energy of the input electromagnetic waves gleaned from different channels is correctly
routed to their corresponding detection regions. The region
having the highest intensity at the output layer indicates the
class identified. Both computational simulations and experimental validation have confirmed that using a SIM with a
deeper architecture can substantially enhance the recognition
performance [17]. For instance, the accuracy of recognizing
10 handwritten digits improves from 65% to 92%, when
increasing the number of metasurface layers from one to seven
(as illustrated in Fig. 2(a) of [17]).
In addition to polarization multiplexing, a broadband SIM
was developed in [16] to perform statistical inference by
encoding the spatial features of objects into spectral power
distributions at preselected wavelengths, with each representing a different classification category. The SIM is trained
to maximize the power of the specific spectral component
corresponding to the true label of each object. As a result,
a single-pixel detector at the output plane becomes sufficient
for analyzing the power distribution across the spectrum and
for performing object classification. Additionally, a compact
fully-connected ANN having merely two hidden layers was
trained for successfully reconstructing the image of the input

objects based on the highly compressed spectral power representations [16], even if they were misclassified by the SIM.
Recently, Hua _et al._ [84] presented AirFC, a representative
paradigm that leverages SIM to enable over-the-air computation for low-latency and energy-efficient analog inference with
enhanced image classification accuracy.


_B. Parameter Estimation_


Wireless sensing relying on radio wave propagation constitutes a fundamental enabler for diverse applications spanning
communication, radar, and navigation systems [85], [86].
Conventional paradigms for target detection and parameter
estimation rely upon an intricate process that involves the RF
front-end circuitry to demodulate and sample multi-channel
baseband signals, followed by computationally intensive algorithmic operations that inherently impose stringent limitations on sensing latency and energy efficiency (EE) [87]. By
contrast, a SIM offers a compelling alternative by directly
processing electromagnetic waves to estimate target parameters, thereby bypassing the conventional requirements for RF
circuitry, ADCs, and digital signal processing infrastructure.
Recent years have witnessed growing research interest in
leveraging SIMs for DOA estimation [29], [88]–[90]. The fundamental mechanism underlying SIM-based DOA estimation
lies in spatially mapping the electromagnetic field distributions
impinging from different source directions into distinct angular
bins. Typically, a SIM is positioned in front of a detector
array, where each detection region corresponds to a specific
angular interval and captures the intensity of the received
electromagnetic field. Through optimization of the control
voltages applied to individual meta-atoms, the SIM can be
trained to focus the energy of the incident waves arriving from
targets at particular angles onto their corresponding detection
regions at the output plane. In [88], Huang _et al._ demonstrated
the feasibility of SIM-based DOA estimation for multiple
incident sources across wide frequency and angular ranges. By
optimizing the physical parameters of the SIM, their sensing
architecture creates distinct virtual channels that isolate and
process different incoming wavefronts, enabling automatic
beam classification and spatial routing based on incidence

angle and frequency. Their experimental implementation employed a dual-layer SIM to detect multiple sources within the
8 _∼_ 12 GHz frequency band for incident angles ranging from

_−_ 30 _[◦]_ to 30 _[◦]_ . The results demonstrated significant reductions
in both processing time and energy consumption compared to
traditional DOA estimation techniques.


To experimentally validate the DOA estimation performance
attained, Gao _et al._ [29] implemented a SIM operating at 27 _._ 5
GHz. As illustrated in Fig. 11(a), the experimental configuration utilized a vector network analyzer (VNA) connected to
horn antennas serving as target sources and a waveguide probe
for signal detection. The detection region of the waveguide
probe was precisely controlled via a translation stage, while
a four-layer passive SIM architecture was designed and fabricated to estimate azimuth angles with 1 _[◦]_ angular resolution
over the range [ _−_ 5 _[◦]_ _,_ 5 _[◦]_ ]. Each metasurface layer consisted of
a 32 _×_ 32 array of modulation elements with half-wavelength
spacing of 5 _._ 45 mm. The output plane was partitioned into
ten distinct detection regions, each mapped to a specific input
angular range. Experimental validation using 100 test samples
yielded energy distributions and confusion matrices presented



in Tab. V, demonstrating that energy is concentrated at the
probe corresponding to the angular interval of the incident
wave. Through temporal multiplexing of different SIM configurations with varying angular resolutions and coverage ranges,
this approach enables precise DOA estimation of multiple
targets across an extended field of view [29].


Additionally, SIMs can function as electromagnetic signal
processors, offering a compelling alternative to conventional
digital computation. For instance, by finely tuning the transmission coefficients of all meta-atoms, a SIM can implement
a two-dimensional (2D) DFT by strategically engineering
wave propagation characteristics [31], [89]. This capability
holds considerable promise for sensing applications having
stringent requirements on computing latency. By applying an
electromagnetic-domain DFT operator in front of a receiving
array, incident electromagnetic waves automatically undergo
transformation into the spatial frequency domain as they propagate through the optimized SIM structure [31]. Consequently,
the target DOA can be directly determined by analyzing signal
intensity distributions across the receiving array. To further enhance the DOA estimation accuracy, An _et al._ [31] aggregated


DRAFT 13



the spatial frequency spectra observed in multiple snapshots.
As illustrated in Fig. 11(b), the transmission coefficients of
the input metasurface layer were systematically reconfigured
across snapshots to generate a series of 2D DFT matrices with
orthogonal spatial frequency bins. Fig. 10 compares the spatial
frequency spectra obtained from both two-layer and four-layer
SIM architectures in dual-target scenarios. The results demonstrate that deeper SIM configurations significantly enhance
DFT matrix approximation fidelity, yielding a substantially
refined spatial frequency spectrum. Experimental validation
confirmed that the SIM, operating at optical computational
speeds, achieved an MSE of _−_ 40 dB for 2D DOA estimation [31].
Moreover, the architecture of SIM can be scaled to enhance
the capability in multi-level diffractive modulation of incident
electromagnetic fields [21]. A larger number of meta-atoms
per layer translates to an expanded aperture, thereby enabling
higher angular resolution in signal detection. Furthermore,
increasing the network depth through additional layers allows
for the estimation of a substantially higher number of target
sources. Unlike conventional angle estimation techniques that
impose substantial computational burdens on electronic systems, a SIM performs DOA estimation at the speed of light,
making it particularly advantageous for latency-sensitive applications, such as autonomous vehicles and high-speed rail communications. Additionally, when multiple sources are present,
the input electromagnetic field comprises a superposition of
plane waves arriving from distinct directions. As a result, the
DOA estimates are subsequently obtained by identifying the
top- _K_ intensity peaks across all detection regions, where _K_
denotes the number of incident signals. Notably, this detection
mechanism inherently enables the designed SIM architecture
to simultaneously estimate both the angles and the number of
target sources [29].


VI. SIM FOR COMPUTING

SIMs have a transformative impact on future computing architectures, opening up new avenues for integrating computing
functions into the wireless transmission process. Next, a pair
of representative examples are provided for demonstrating its
exciting potential way beyond wireless communication and
sensing applications.


_A. Pattern Generation_

Computational imaging is capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional optical imaging techniques [91]. By leveraging a SIM as a front-end, novel imaging capabilities can be
achieved by precisely controlling its internal electromagnetic
fields and pairing it with appropriate computational algorithms.
Building upon this philosophy, Hassan _et al._ [92] established
an analytical framework for calculating the received power of
signals after passing through a SIM. They further proposed
a pair of distinct optimization approaches: a GD method
for meta-atoms featuring continuous phase modulation, and a
successive refinement technique for those with discrete phase
configurations. Their simulation results revealed that a threelayer SIM capable of continuous phase adjustment could concentrate over 90% of radiated power within targeted regions.

Fig. 12: Holograms generated by a two-layer SIM at six
different twist angles.


By contrast, achieving comparable power concentration with
binary phase shift meta-atoms necessitated more than five
metasurface layers.
To address the substantial challenge of high maintenance
costs associated with conventional image storage, Fan _et_
_al._ [93] introduced the concept of metasurface-based disks
(meta-disks) that extend the capacity limits of holographic
storage by exploiting uncorrelated structural twist angles. This
approach enables the storage of large volumes of information
through internal structural multiplexing. Utilizing advanced
3D printing technology combined with Pancharatnam-Berry
metasurfaces [93], the authors fabricated a twin-layer SIM
architecture with an interlayer spacing of 1 _,_ 000 _µ_ m, where
each layer comprises circular disks containing 256 meta-atoms
in radius. To demonstrate the SIM’s potential for holographic
display applications, the temporal information from an original
video was encoded into different twist angles between the
two meta-disk layers. As illustrated in Fig. 12, high-quality
video sequences with a resolution of 200 _×_ 200 pixels were
successfully reconstructed at the designated output plane by
sequentially adjusting the metasurface twist angle at intervals
of 60 _[◦]_ .
This advanced pattern generation technology holds significant promise for next-generation multiple access using
holograms and may potentially unlock new possibilities for
generative AI applications. Moreover, this method can be
utilized to enable semantic information representation, particularly for intricate scene information such as geometric
configurations and spatial arrangements, which are difficult to
describe accurately using conventional techniques. By using a
SIM to directly generate the desired shape and edge at the receiving array, the amount of data traffic could be tremendously
reduced [83].


_B. Logical Operations_


In addition, SIMs offer promising capabilities for implementing logical operations in the spatial domain, which
holds substantial potential for future bit-level electromagnetic
information processing. A recent experimental demonstration [26] showcased a twin-layer microwave-frequency SIM
that successfully realized the three fundamental binary logical
operations: AND, OR, and NOT. The architecture employs
an input layer comprising a patterned mask with multiple


DRAFT 14

switchable regions, each capable of toggling between high
and low transmittance states, where the high transmittance
state designates regions activated for logical computation.
At the output plane, two distinct regions encode the binary
logic states ‘1’ and ‘0’, respectively. Through training the
phase modulation of each hidden layer via error backpropagation [26], the SIM achieves precise electromagnetic wave
routing to the appropriate output region. Building upon this
foundation, Ding _et al._ [94] introduced a novel architecture for
optical quantum-domain logical operations leveraging spatial
and polarization multiplexing within a SIM framework. In
their approach, the pair of quantum states, _|_ 0 _⟩_ and _|_ 1 _⟩_, are
encoded using orthogonal linear polarization states of classical
electromagnetic waves. By superimposing these basis states,
the optimized SIM successfully executes four fundamental
quantum-domain logical operations: the three Pauli gates and
the Hadamard gate. Remarkably, the optical quantum operator
implemented exhibited exceptional fidelity across all four
gates, achieving 99 _._ 96% in numerical simulations and 99 _._ 88%
in experimental validation.
Instead of employing linear momentum states for logic
representation that may suffer from ambiguous discrimination boundaries, the authors of [95] introduced an innovative
technique of leveraging orbital angular momentum (OAM)
modes as logical states. This methodology not only augments
the parallel processing capacity attained but also significantly
enhances the distinguishability and robustness of logical states,
capitalizing on the infinite dimensionality and orthogonality
of OAM modes. Through precise manipulation of the phase
and amplitude distributions across multiple diffractive layers,
the SIM enables independent control of both the modal
content and spatial positioning of multiple OAM beams. As
illustrated in Fig. 13, two OAM modes incident from distinct

two inputs, while C represents the output port located at the
center of the output layer.


spatial locations serve as input data, and the primary objective
of the SIM is to perform independent modulation of these
input fields, thus ensuring that the transformations conform
to the computational requirements of logical gates. Following
wavefront modulation through multiple diffraction screens and
subsequent propagation, a vortex beam carrying a single OAM
mode emerges at the center of the output plane. Fig. 14
illustrates the OAM-based logic AND gate, where the first and
second columns display the intensity distributions of the input
beams, with the color gradient from blue to red indicating the
OAM mode order. The corresponding outputs are shown in the
third column of Fig. 14, which conform to that of the logic
AND gate.
In [96], Liu _et al._ developed a SIM architecture that achieves
remarkable neuronal density for optical computing, integrating
40 _,_ 000 neurons within a compact 2 cm _×_ 2 cm footprint. To
validate this platform, they numerically simulated an optical
half-adder employing two metasurface layers and subsequently
verified it experimentally in the Terahertz regime. Similarly,
the authors of [97] utilized SIM to realize a polarizationencoded logical operation exhibiting high extinction ratios.
Their approach harnesses free-space electromagnetic wave
propagation and sophisticated engineered interactions with
cascaded passive diffractive layers to enable efficient optical
computation. As depicted in Fig. 15, they implemented a fivelayer architecture capable of executing various logic operations, with constituent pixels featuring dimensions on the
order of several hundred nanometers. The binary logical states
‘0’ and ‘1’ are encoded using linearly polarized light beams
with electric field orientations along the _X_ and _Y_ directions,
respectively, which are injected into the input ports A and
B. Upon propagation through the appropriately configured
SIM, a linearly polarized beam emerges at output port C,
corresponding to the logical states ‘0’ or ‘1’, respectively.
By enriching the input encoding patterns and adopting more
sophisticated network architectures, SIMs can theoretically
realize arbitrary logical functions, presenting promising opportunities for dynamic over-the-air encryption of electromagnetic
signals.


VII. FUSION OF COMMUNICATION, SENSING, AND
COMPUTING


Emerging application scenarios increasingly necessitate the
convergence of communication, sensing, and computing func

of SIM for achieving multifocusing and holographic imaging.


tionalities within a unified infrastructure. The integration of
radar sensing and edge computing capabilities into WiFi
and cellular networks, for example, demonstrates considerable
potential for efficient radio resource orchestration [21], [28].
This convergence paradigm suggests that a single multifunctional SIM device could simultaneously fulfill these diverse
objectives [98]. In this section, we examine existing advances
in multiplexing SIM technology to accomplish multiple concurrent tasks.
In [99], Niu _et al._ explored a SIM-enhanced integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, wherein the
SIM was configured to produce a tailored beam pattern
enabling simultaneous multi-user downlink communication
and radar target detection. To achieve this end, the authors
formulated an optimization problem aimed at maximizing
spectral efficiency subject to directional power constraints,
necessitating the joint optimization of the SIM phase shifts
and the BS’s power allocation. By treating the sensing power
constraint as a penalty term within the objective function, they
developed and solved the resultant optimization problem using
a customized GA algorithm. Following this, Li _et al._ [100]
conceived an advanced transmit beamforming technique for
SIM-enabled ISAC systems, where they employed a multilayer beamformer design that maximizes user sum rate, while
optimally sculpting the normalized beam pattern for sensing
purposes. The resultant non-convex multi-objective optimization problem was addressed through a dual-normalized differential GD algorithm, which leverages gradient differences
and dual normalization to strike a flexible trade-off between
communication and sensing performance objectives. Furthermore, Jiang _et al._ [101] designed a satellite equipped with
SIM to perform dual-function precoding in the wave domain

- eliminating the need for conventional digital beamformers

- for simultaneously detecting multiple airborne targets,
while serving multiple ground-based communication users. A
penalty-based GA algorithm was developed for maximizing
the communication throughput attained, while maintaining
sensing performance.
Recently, Gao _et al._ [29] have demonstrated the significant
potential of SIM in RIS-aided mmWave ISAC systems. In
contrast to conventional RIS-based communication systems,



where DOA estimation necessitates for the BS to execute a series of computationally intensive operations, including downconversion, sampling, and digital signal processing, a SIM
directly infers angular information from the incident signals
and facilitates edge computing. This capability substantially
reduces both the power consumption and latency in beamtracking applications. Specifically, they developed a reflective
liquid crystal (LC)-based RIS architecture comprising 20 _×_ 20
programmable meta-atoms, where each meta-atom achieves
5-bit phase modulation of the incident electromagnetic field
through FPGA-controlled supply voltages. By employing a
passive SIM to estimate the DOAs of signals originating from
both the BS and user, the RIS dynamically optimizes its
beamforming configuration to establish a virtual communication link with high-velocity mobile users. Experimental results
reveal that the system achieves an average amplitude gain
of 17 _._ 9 dB at the user’s antenna compared to configurations
operating without SIM [29].
Moreover, Jia _et al._ [102] explored the potential of using
a SIM to support the dual functions of imaging and beamforming. Specifically, they developed an advanced architecture
employing two layers of tunable binary transmissive metasurfaces that are capable of generating complex holographic
patterns on a 2D plane. By optimizing the binary phase of
each meta-atom to minimize discrepancies between the actual
and desired radiation patterns, as illustrated in Fig. 16, this
SIM configuration can simultaneously achieve multi-focusing
and holographic imaging capabilities, while maintaining a
transmission efficiency exceeding 95%.


VIII. KEY TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATED TO SIMS


In this section, we explore the practical challenges of
implementing SIMs. Specifically, we cover several key aspects, including channel estimation, antenna selection and
user association, inter-layer propagation coefficient calibration,
propagation modeling, and EE analysis.


_A. Channel Estimation_


Accurate channel state information (CSI) is vital for carrying out the desired signal processing function in the wave
domain, particularly in dynamic wireless communication systems [21], [103]. Typically, each metasurface layer consists
of a large number of meta-atoms, which leads to a situation
where the number of RF chains at the BS is much lower than
the dimension of channels between the SIM and users. This
disparity renders CSI acquisition in SIM-assisted communication systems an under-determined problem. To tackle this
issue, Nadeem _et al._ [104] developed a channel estimation
technique that collects multiple copies of uplink pilot signals
that propagate through the SIM. Orthogonal pilot signals were
employed to prevent interference between users. Moreover,
they theoretically analyzed the MSE of the channel estimates
and applied a GD algorithm to optimize the phase shifts of
meta-atoms, aiming for minimizing the MSE. Notably, they
also demonstrated that by leveraging the low-rank property of
channel correlation matrices [105], the pilot overhead can be
significantly reduced.

Furthermore, Yao _et al._ [106] identified a subspace that
spans any spatial correlation matrix when ultra-dense elements
are arranged on a metasurface. By relying on realistic partial
CSI of the channel statistics, two subspace-based channel
estimators were developed for enhancing the estimation accuracy by projecting both conventional least squares (LS)
and MMSE estimates into the lower-dimensional subspace
they identified. In [107], the same researchers exploited the
sparse nature of mmWave channels in the beam domain. They
framed the channel estimation problem of SIM-aided mmWave
communication systems as a sparse recovery task and applied
the popular orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm
to determine the channel parameters. Additionally, they introduced a soft decision threshold for terminating the OMP
iterations when the sparsity is unknown. Recent studies [108]
and [109] have also applied alternative LS and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to address channel estimation challenges in SIM-assisted communication systems. To illustrate,
the existing channel estimation techniques conceived for SIMassisted communication systems are summarized in Table VI.


_B. Antenna Selection and User Association_


SIM essentially performs specific transformations, as waves
propagate through it. For SIM to work effectively, it is crucial
to establish bespoke protocols that define the role of each
port. The assignment and definition of these ports significantly
impact the overall performance. In wireless communication
systems, this involves selecting the appropriate antennas and
matching them to the right users. To illustrate this concept,
let’s consider a multiuser transmission scenario, where a SIM
is utilized to mitigate interference among multiple users in the
wave domain.

_⋄_ _**Antenna Selection:**_ As shown in Fig. 17, different antenna selection schemes can influence the capability of
SIMs for mitigating inter-user interference. When the
antennas are too close to each other, it becomes harder
for users to differentiate their individual signals from
the superimposed waveforms. Hence, selecting antennas that are spaced far apart enhances the ability to
achieve interference-free transmission using the wavedomain beamforming technique.
_⋄_ _**User Association:**_ As illustrated in Fig. 18, the choice
of the specific user association strategy also affects the
performance of wave-domain beamforming. Following
the same principle as in classic antenna selection, it is



suggested that neighboring antennas at the BS should
transmit signals to two users who are farther apart.
This setup allows for achieving effective interference
mitigation.


Specifically, when considering a scenario, where a BS with
_M_ antennas serves _K_ users, the total number of possible
combinations for implementing antenna selection and user
association can be expressed as


_M_ !
_P_ ( _M, K_ ) = (2)
( _M −_ _K_ )! _[.]_


Therefore, determining the optimal pairing scheme of antennas
to users is an NP-hard problem, necessitating the development
of efficient heuristic methods. A similar challenge exists in
sensing and computing applications. For instance, in object
recognition, the assignment of probes to various image categories can have a significant impact on the classification
performance. As such, these assignments must be carefully
planned before the practical implementation of SIM.
At the time of writing, research on antenna selection and
user association in SIM-aided systems is still in its early
stages. In [110], Lin _et al._ investigated the impact of antenna
selection on SIM performance in low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications. They developed a user grouping method
to manage large numbers of users by dividing them into
multiple groups based on channel correlation. Within each
group, users are served using spatial division multiple access
(SDMA), while different groups are served in separate time
slots. To further enhance system performance, the Hungarian
algorithm was used at the satellite to optimize antenna selection [110]. In [111], Shi _et al._ examined the AP-UE association
in cell-free systems. They employed a greedy algorithm to pair
UEs with their nearest APs and then jointly optimized power
allocation and wave-based precoding to maximize data rates.


_C. Propagation Coefficient Calibration_


The deformation of the mechanical support structure during
the assembly of the SIM, as well as the bending of the
metasurfaces due to their weight, can cause the propagation
coefficients _wn,_ _[l]_ _n_ ˜ [between adjacent metasurface layers to de-]
viate from their initial values modelled in (1). This deviation
presents challenges during the configuration of the SIM in
the training process and may negatively impact its inference
performance. Therefore, before implementing the SIM, it is

crucial to appropriately calibrate the wave propagation coefficients between adjacent metasurface layers to ensure more
reliable training results [14]. In [19], Liu _et al._ utilized 5 _,_ 000
experimental samples to fine-tune the propagation coefficients
by employing the gradient descent method. For each sample,
they applied random bias voltages to all the meta-atoms in
the SIM and measured the resultant output field patterns
using a custom array of 8 _×_ 8 receiving antennas. After
calibrating the propagation coefficients, they found that the
measured energy distributions closely matched the simulated
ones, demonstrating excellent agreement.


_D. Propagation Modeling_


Accurate propagation modeling is essential for producing
the desired inference results [112]. Given that SIMs rely on
the cascaded response of multiple metasurface layers, several
recent contributions have been made to characterize the nearfield wave propagation within SIMs. In [113], Maryam _et_
_al._ investigated the achievable sum-rate of SIMs in uplink
scenarios while accounting for hardware imperfections. The
authors formulated a non-convex sum-rate optimization problem and employed genetic algorithms alongside interior point
methods to obtain the solution. Evaluating the performance
under both Rayleigh fading and 3GPP channel models under
constraints on either equal numbers of RF chains or equal
physical aperture sizes, they demonstrated that SIMs outperform conventional digital phased arrays, when the number
of RF chains is held constant. Building upon this, Nerini _et_
_al._ [114] developed a physically consistent channel model
for SIM-aided systems that explicitly incorporates realistic
element coupling effects and accounts for metasurfaces having
non-diagonal phase shift matrices.
More recently, Abrardo _et al._ [115] proposed a comprehensive optimization framework for heterogeneous SIM
architectures that circumvents the restrictive assumptions of



prior approaches. The model they presented is grounded in
multi-port network theory for characterizing general electromagnetic collaborative objects (ECOs) and establishes a
unified optimization framework. Subsequently, they view SIMs
as a specific ECO architecture, providing valuable insights
into optimization strategies across various SIM configurations
and analyzing the associated computational complexity. The
authors further examine the implications of commonly adopted
modeling assumptions and introduce a backpropagation-based
algorithm for implementing GD optimization in simplified
SIM configurations.


_E. Energy Efficiency Analysis_

Energy loss analysis is critical for validating a SIM’s lowpower performance in signal processing applications. In [116],
Stefan _et al._ investigated the EE performance of SIM-based
MIMO broadcast systems. To comprehensively evaluate the
potential of a SIM, they examined both dirty paper coding (DPC) and linear precoding schemes, formulating corresponding EE maximization problems for each approach and
leveraging the broadcast channel (BC)-multiple-access channel
(MAC) duality to derive an equivalent optimization problem.
Subsequently, they optimized the users’ covariance matrices
through successive convex approximation (SCA) based on
a tight lower bound of the achievable sum-rate, coupled
with Dinkelbach’s method. The resultant high-dimensional
phase shift optimization problem was solved by using a
conventional projected gradient-based approach. In [117], Shi
_et al._ examined the integration of SIM into multi-antenna
BSs for downlink multi-user communications, presenting a
realistic power consumption model for SIM-assisted systems.
They employed a quadratic transformation to reformulate
the EE maximization problem and proposed an AO-based
joint precoding framework. Specifically, an SCA algorithm
was adopted for base station precoding design, while wavebased beamforming was tackled using two approaches: a highperformance semidefinite programming (SDP) method and
a computationally efficient projected gradient ascent (PGA)
algorithm. Notably, their results revealed that although the
optimal number of SIM layers differs between EE and spectral efficiency maximization objectives, a configuration of
2 _∼_ 5 layers achieves satisfactory performance across both
metrics [117].


IX. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

In this section, we identify research opportunities and challenges ahead for further enhancing the inference capabilities
and computational power of SIM.


_A. Channel Multiplexing_

In addition to directly processing the phase and amplitude
of input waves, SIMs can tap into all the DoFs exhibited by
electromagnetic waves. Various multiplexing schemes, such as
polarization, spectrum, and vortex, can be leveraged to expand
the number of available channels, as illustrated in Fig. 19.

_⋄_ _**Polarization:**_ The subwavelength structures of
anisotropic meta-atoms that exhibit polarization-selective


DRAFT 18


Fig. 19: Schematic of multifunctional SIM, where the number of available channels can be expanded by multiplexing
polarization, OAM, and frequencies. In addition, by integrating nonlinear modules, leveraging inter-layer signal reflections, or
cascading an electronic network, DNN, RNN, or HOENN can be created to further improve the computing power of SIM.



responses allow for independent, pixel-level control over
polarization states [17].
_⋄_ _**OAM:**_ Moreover, metasurfaces bestow the unprecedented
ability to manipulate structured electromagnetic waves to
multiplex information in different OAM channels [15].
_⋄_ _**Frequency:**_ Sophisticated meta-atoms also provide
unique opportunities for operating across multiple wavelength channels by simultaneously tuning the modulation response and by carefully engineering the native
dispersion characteristics of individual meta-atoms on
demand [16].
These multiplexing strategies provide distinct advantages in
terms of massively increasing the computing scale and degree
of parallelism. As a result, a SIM can concurrently perform
multiple tasks by processing each channel independently.


_B. Structural Parameter Analysis_

Similar to an ANN, the representation capability of a SIM
is influenced by the number of metasurface layers and the
number of meta-atoms per layer. Additionally, the per-layer
topology of meta-atoms and inter-layer spacing have an impact
on the inference ability of a SIM. Understanding the influence
of these hardware parameters is essential for determining the
most effective configuration for a practical SIM device.

_⋄_ _**Number of Layers:**_ It has been shown that a SIM
can approximate any universal linear transformations by
performing cascaded complex-valued matrix operations
with arbitrarily small error [15]. The dimensionality of
the space for linear transformations that can be processed
by a SIM is linearly proportional to the number of metasurface layers. In general, deep architectures comprising
a larger number of metasurface layers are capable of
extracting better features compared to shallow ones. However, they also suffer from increased material absorption



and surface back reflections, which drastically degrade
the power efficiency. Therefore, the fundamental tradeoff
between inference accuracy and power efficiency makes
the use of a massive number of cascaded metasurface
layers challenging.
_⋄_ _**Number of Meta-atoms:**_ Employing more meta-atoms
within each layer can improve the performance of a
SIM. However, the law of diminishing returns holds,
as the meta-atoms located far from the paraxial region
have a negligible impact on the desired input-output
transformations.
_⋄_ _**Per-layer Topology:**_ Periodic metasurface designs may
result in redundant propagation paths within a SIM.
Hence, altering the topology of subwavelength metaatoms can introduce additional flexibility to tune the
transfer function of a SIM. Designing sophisticated metaatom patterns and sparse interconnections could enhance
the performance for a given number of meta-atoms or
achieve desired functionalities with a more efficient SIM
architecture [118].
_⋄_ _**Inter-layer Spacing:**_ The connectivity within a SIM can
also be controlled by adjusting the distance between
metasurface layers using micro-electromechanical systems. Alternatively, the effective path length between
metasurface layers can be tailored by tuning the refractive
index of phase-changing materials without changing the
physical distances.
In a nutshell, designing an effective SIM requires carefully
balancing these fundamental tradeoffs, which remains an open
challenge.


_C. Neural Network Architecture_

The concept of neural networks has been utilized for explaining the operating principles of SIMs. However, a SIM


DRAFT 19



does not inherently include any non-linearity, except for the
receiving detector. This limitation may degrade the ability of
SIM to extract complex features and handle challenging tasks.
As illustrated in Fig. 19, three potential directions can be
explored for further enhancing the inference capabilities of
SIM:


_⋄_ _**DNN:**_ Developing materials and meta-atom designs that
exhibit nonlinear responses would be critical for creating
authentic DNNs. The inference accuracy of SIMs could
benefit from directly integrating a nonlinear module into
the meta-atoms. For instance, by altering the voltages applied to the varactor, a programmable activation function
can be obtained by detecting the input intensity and by
feeding back the threshold to an amplifier in each metaatom [118]. However, this demands appropriate modeling
of the electromagnetic responses and a scalable as well
as power-efficient design.
_⋄_ _**HOENN:**_ The cascade of a SIM (optical network) and a
shallow electronic ANN could create a hybrid opticalelectronic neural network (HOENN) having improved
performance [16]. A SIM can convert phase-encoded
information into intensity patterns, and then energyefficient energy detectors can act as activation functions
for enhancing the inference capability of HOENNs.
_⋄_ _**RNN:**_ Existing SIM designs typically use anti-reflective
coatings to suppress back-and-forth reflection losses
within the SIM [17]. However, taking advantage of
these inter-layer reflections could enable the design of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), significantly improving the inference capability of SIMs. Characterizing the
coupling between densely packed metasurface layers is
quite challenging, as it depends on the configuration of
other metasurface layers.


X. CONCLUSIONS


SIM technology holds the promise of supporting analog
electromagnetic signal processing at the speed of light. In
this overview, we have discussed recent advances in SIM
research and development. Beginning with the fundamental
principles behind SIM, we have reviewed the substantial
progress made in fabricating SIMs for various inference tasks
across communication, sensing, and computing applications.
We have also unveiled a wealth of new opportunities that
could further enhance the computing capability of SIMs and
have identified key challenges that still have to be addressed.
In summary, SIM has the potential to revolutionize interdisciplinary research at the intersection of electromagnetism, AI,
and metamaterials science. Taking advantage of the complementary nature of these emerging technologies may significantly advance all these fields.
