**ABSTRACT**


We develop an economic model of decentralised exchanges (DEXs) in which risk

averse liquidity providers (LPs) manage risk in a centralised exchange (CEX) based


on preferences, information, and trading costs. Rational, risk-averse LPs antici

pate the frictions associated with replication and manage risk primarily by reducing


the reserves supplied to the DEX. Greater aversion reduces the equilibrium viabil

ity of liquidity provision, resulting in thinner markets and lower trading volumes.


Greater uninformed demand supports deeper liquidity, whereas higher fundamental


price volatility erodes it. Finally, while moderate anticipated price changes can im

prove LP performance, larger changes require more intensive trading in the CEX,


generate higher replication costs, and induce LPs to reduce liquidity supply.

Decentralised exchanges (DEXs) organise trading on blockchains and have become a
central component of decentralised finance. [1] Their widespread adoption hinges on whether

liquidity provision remains viable when DEXs operate alongside competing centralised ex
changes (CEXs), where prices form and liquidity providers (LPs) actively manage risk. Yet,

the extant literature abstracts from key economic mechanisms when assessing LP returns

and risks: it treats liquidity supply and market conditions as exogenous and focuses on per
fect replication in a frictionless CEX. This paper studies the endogenous viability of DEX

liquidity provision and the resulting market outcomes when risk-averse LPs anticipate (i)

managing exposure in a CEX, accounting for risk preferences, private information, and trad
ing costs, and (ii) strategic interactions with liquidity takers (LTs) whose trading volumes

adjust to the level of liquidity supplied.

Our main finding is that a rational, risk-averse LP anticipates the frictions associated

with risk offsetting in the CEX and manages risk exposure not only through replication,

but primarily by reducing the level of reserves supplied to the DEX. The intuition is as

follows. Both (i) net inventory exposure and (ii) trading costs incurred in the CEX generate

disutility for a risk-averse LP. Disutility from inventory risk incentivises the LP to actively

replicate her DEX position in the CEX, while disutility from CEX trading costs discourages

such replication. The equilibrium outcome reflects the balance between these two forces:

the ratio of risk aversion to trading costs determines the aggressiveness of replication in the

CEX and, in turn, the level and profitability of liquidity provision in the DEX. We find that

the viability of liquidity provision in DEXs deteriorates as the disutility from risk aversion

dominates that from trading costs, because this leads the LP to trade more heavily on the
CEX, and to supply less liquidity due to increasing anticipated trading costs. [2] In some

cases, there exists a threshold level of aversion beyond which liquidity provision in DEXs is

no longer viable and markets shut down.

Our second finding is that access to private information about future prices does not

systematically translate into more profitable liquidity provision. For moderate expected

price innovations, the LP benefits from her informational advantage. However, when a risk
averse LP expects large price movements, she anticipates that replicating the position in the

CEX will require more intensive trading and higher costs. Anticipating these frictions, the

LP supplies less liquidity in the DEX, resulting in thinner markets, lower profitability of

liquidity provision, and lower trading volumes of uninformed demand.


1Monthly trading volumes on DEXs reached $420 billion in 2025; see Cong and He (2019); John et al.
(2023); Harvey et al. (2024).
2A limiting case corresponds to perfect replication, which yields the lowest liquidity supply in our model.
In contrast, the extant literature focuses on this case under the assumption of a frictionless CEX; see, for
example, Milionis et al. (2022); Cartea et al. (2023); Bichuch and Feinstein (2024).

Our third finding is that the viability of liquidity provision is fundamentally driven by

the elasticity and profitability of noise demand, and by the volatility of fundamentals. When

noise demand increases or becomes less sensitive to trading costs, the LP anticipates higher

fee revenue and is willing to bear greater risk. She does so by reducing the aggressiveness

of her CEX trading and by increasing her liquidity supply on the DEX. In contrast, higher

fundamental price volatility substantially increases expected adverse selection costs. The LP

anticipates this by reducing liquidity supply and offsetting risk aggressively in the CEX to

maintain expected outcomes consistent with her risk preferences.

Overall, our results show that the risks and rewards of liquidity provision are not sum
marised by a single measure from exogenous market conditions. Instead, they emerge en
dogenously and are determined by (i) the LP’s risk preferences, (ii) her private information,

and (iii) market conditions, including CEX liquidity depth, fundamental volatility, and the

elasticity of uninformed liquidity demand.

Our theoretical contribution is to propose an economic model that endogenises the risk
reward trade-off of liquidity provision in DEXs and the trading volumes of liquidity takers,

when the liquidity provider has access to a CEX where inventory risk can be offset at a

cost. In our model, there are three types of agents: a representative liquidity provider (LP),

noise liquidity takers (noise LTs), and arbitrageurs. These agents interact in three stages.

In stage one, the LP chooses the amount of reserves to deposit in the DEX. In stage two,

the LP determines a dynamic strategy to (partially) offset exposure in the CEX, taking into

account costs, risk preferences, and private price information. In stage three, trading begins:

noise LTs with elastic demand arrive (unpredictably) at the DEX and optimise their trading

volumes, arbitrageurs align the DEX’s marginal price with its fundamental value, and the

LP executes her strategy. Our model assumes that the DEX operates as a secondary market

and does not influence equilibrium outcomes in the CEX. The model is solved recursively,

by dynamic programming.

In **stage three**, noise LTs arrive in the DEX at a known intensity and take the current

reserves as given to determine their optimal trading volumes. Specifically, they balance the

trading costs implied by the LP’s reserves in the DEX against their private utility from

holding the asset. Trading costs directly depend on the liquidity reserves deposited by the

LP. Specifically, in DEXs, liquidity providers deposit capital into a pool that liquidity takers

use to execute trades in exchange for a fee. The DEX functions as an algorithmic market

maker whose price and liquidity dynamics are determined by the pricing rules encoded in
the DEX’s smart contract, [3] the amount of capital in the pool, and the trading fee.


3A smart contract is a publicly accessible and immutable program running on the blockchain that defines
the rules of interaction with the pool for both liquidity providers and liquidity takers.

In **stage two**, the LP determines her optimal CEX risk offsetting strategy for an ar
bitrary level of liquidity supply. The strategy explicitly accounts for CEX trading costs,

investment horizon, net exposure risk aversion, and private information. We employ vari
ational methods to characterise and solve the optimal strategy in the setting of a DEX

with an arbitrary convex bonding curve and when the LP’s trading activity generates both

permanent and transient market impact. We show that the system of forward–backward

stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) characterizing the LP’s strategy reduces to a dif
ferential Riccati equation (DRE), whose solution exists, is unique, and can be efficiently

computed. In the absence of transient impact, we further derive a closed-form solution.

The optimal risk-offsetting strategy comprises two components: (i) a _tracking component_,

which balances net exposure aversion and CEX trading costs to partially replicate changes

in the DEX’s liquidity position, and (ii) a _speculative component_, which adjusts the LP’s net

exposure to exploit private information.

In **stage one**, the LP anticipates that (i) noise LTs are sensitive to the trading costs

implied by the level of DEX reserves, (ii) part of her risk will be offset in the CEX, and

(iii) arbitrageurs will align the DEX price to its fundamental value. Thus, the LP sets the

optimal level of DEX reserves by trading off anticipated losses to arbitrageurs against (i)

anticipated fee revenue from the elastic demand of noise LTs and (ii) the effects of her activity

in the CEX. We characterise the LP’s optimisation problem and show it admits a solution

for DEXs with arbitrary convex bonding curves.

Finally, in the case of constant product markets such as Uniswap, and in the absence of

transient price impact in the CEX, we derive analytical formulae for the equilibrium trading

volumes, liquidity supply, and the returns and risks of liquidity provision.

**Literature review.** Numerous works explore the microstructure of DEXs. Angeris

et al. (2021); Capponi et al. (2023); Cartea et al. (2024a) show that DEXs generate losses

for liquidity suppliers. Jaimungal et al. (2023); Cartea et al. (2025) study liquidity taking

in DEXs. Lehar and Parlour (2021) describe competition between DEXs and order books.

Hasbrouck et al. (2022) show that higher DEX fees increase liquidity supply and reduce

trading costs. Bichuch and Feinstein (2022) formalise the axioms governing DEX design.

Klein et al. (2023) examine the role of informed liquidity supply in price discovery. Park

(2023) discuss the different types of trading costs in DEXs. Malinova and Park (2024)

investigate the potential of DEXs to organise equity trading. Cartea et al. (2024b); He

et al. (2024) propose DEX designs aimed at mitigating losses for liquidity suppliers. Recent

works also examine the optimal behavior of liquidity providers and the optimal dynamic fee

structure of DEXs assuming exogenous levels of reserves; see Bergault et al. (2025); Baggiani

et al. (2025). In particular, Campbell et al. (2025) also discusses the costs of replication in


4


the CEX. Finally, Capponi et al. (2025); He et al. (2025) characterise the microstructure of

DEXs by incorporating the consensus protocols of blockchains.

Our work is related to the literature on algorithmic trading using stochastic control tools;

see Cartea et al. (2015), Guéant (2016), and Donnelly (2022). We incorporate trading signals,

first introduced in Cartea and Jaimungal (2016b), where they were interpreted as order-flow
indicators. [4] Latent models with trading signals were studied in Casgrain and Jaimungal

(2019), while a variational approach to solving trading problems involving multiple agents

with heterogeneous beliefs was proposed in Casgrain and Jaimungal (2018, 2020); Wu and

Jaimungal (2024). Finally, inventory targeting in optimal trading was analysed in Cartea

and Jaimungal (2016a) and Bank et al. (2017).

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section I describes the economic trade
offs faced by liquidity providers in DEXs and introduces the model. Section II solves for the

trading volumes of noise LTs in stage three. Section III analyses the replication problem of

the LP in stage two. Section IV derives the optimal liquidity supply in stage one. Section V

examines the equilibrium reward–risk trade-off in the case of a constant product market such

as Uniswap and presents numerical experiments.

### **I. General features of the model**


DEXs operate with liquidity pooling, where available reserves are aggregated in a com
mon pool, and algorithmic rules, hardcoded in smart contracts running on the blockchain,

determine execution prices for liquidity takers (LTs) and revenue for liquidity providers

(LPs). This section describes the mechanics of price and liquidity in DEXs, and introduces

the general features of our model.
Consider a DEX for a pair of assets _{X, Y }_, where _X_ is a reference asset used by agents to
value their wealth, and _Y_ is a risky asset. Let a representative LP deposit initial reserves _X_ 0
and _Y_ 0 of assets _X_ and _Y_, respectively, into the DEX pool at time 0. The LP then remains
passive until a terminal investment horizon _T_, i.e., she neither adds to, nor withdraws from,
the reserves in the pool. As trading unfolds over a time window [0 _, T_ ], where _T >_ 0 _,_ the

available reserves in the pool serve as counterparty to LT trades. Consequently, the reserves

in both assets _X_ and _Y_ in the DEX evolve dynamically. Let ( _Xt_ ) _t_ 0 and ( _Yt_ ) _t_ 0 denote the
_≥_ _≥_
processes describing the evolution of reserves in assets _X_ and _Y_, respectively.


**DEX price and liquidity.** The mechanics of DEXs that determine price and liquidity are

defined by _iso-liquidity curves_ . Once the LP establishes the pool, and provided she remains


4A specific application is investigated in Lehalle and Neuman (2019).

passive, the reserves satisfy, for all _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ],


_f_ ( _Xt, Yt_ ) = _κ_ [2] = _f_ ( _X_ 0 _, Y_ 0) _,_ (1)


where _κ >_ 0 denotes the _liquidity depth_ of the DEX, and _f_ : (0 _, ∞_ ) [2] _→_ (0 _, ∞_ ) is the DEX’s
_trading function_ . The trading function _f_ defines, in (1), all combinations of reserves in assets
_X_ and _Y_ that leave the LP _indifferent_, i.e., that do not change the liquidity depth _κ_ . For

the analysis that follows, we make the following assumptions.


**Assumption** 1: (i) _f ∈_ _C_ [3] ((0 _, ∞_ ) [2] ) _and has strictly positive partial derivatives._
(ii) _For each y >_ 0 _, f_ ( _·, y_ ) : (0 _, ∞_ ) _→_ (0 _, ∞_ ) _is surjective. Thus, for each κ >_ 0 _, the level_
_set f_ ( _x, y_ ) = _κ_ [2] _admits a unique solution x_ = _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) _._
(iii) _R_ := _∂_ _[∂]_ 1 [2] _f_ _[f]_ _[satisfies][ R ∂]_ [1] _[R][ −]_ _[∂]_ [2] _[R >]_ [ 0] _[ everywhere, and is decreasing in][ κ.]_

(iv) _∂_ 1 _φ satisfies the limits_ lim _y_ 0 _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) = _and_ lim _y_ _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) = 0 _._
_↓_ _−∞_ _↑∞_

Assumption 1(i) implies that the liquidity depth _κ_ increases in the reserves held in the
DEX. We refer to _φ_ in Assumption 1(ii) as the _level function_ . By the implicit function
theorem, and since _f_ has strictly positive partial derivatives by Assumption 1(i), the mapping
_φ_ is _C_ [3] on (0 _, ∞_ ) [2] . Using (1), and assuming no additional liquidity is supplied nor withdrawn,
we express the reserve in the reference asset _X_ as a function of the reserves in the risky asset
_Y_ and the liquidity depth _κ_ as
_Xt_ = _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _._ (2)


In DEXs, if an LT wishes to buy a quantity ∆ _y_ of the risky asset, the indifference
condition (1), or equivalently (2), determines the amount ∆ _x_ of the reference asset that she

must pay to the DEX, which satisfies


_Xt_ + ∆ _x_ = _φ_ ( _Yt −_ ∆ _y, κ_ ) _._


Thus, the execution price obtained by the LT per unit of the risky asset is given by [5]



∆ _x_ _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][ −]_ [∆] _[y, κ]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[X][t]_
∆ _y_ [=] ∆ _y_




_[y, κ]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[X][t]_

= _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][ −]_ [∆] _[y, κ]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [)]
∆ _y_ ∆ _y_



_._ (3)
∆ _y_



5The execution price here refers to the amount of the reference asset that the LP pays per unit of the
risky asset purchased.


6


Similarly, if an LT wishes to sell a quantity ∆ _y_ of the risky asset, the execution price is [6]


∆ _x_

_[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t]_ [ + ∆] _[y, κ]_ [)] _._ (4)
∆ _y_ [=] ∆ _y_


Note that as the traded quantity tends to zero, the execution prices to buy and sell

the risky asset in (3)–(4) both converge to the execution price for an infinitesimal quantity _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ), which we refer to as the _marginal price_ . The marginal price serves as a
_−_
reference price analogous to the midprice in limit order books. In particular, the difference

between the marginal price and the execution prices in (3)–(4) quantifies the trading costs

associated with executing a given quantity in the DEX. These trading costs are expressed as



_φ_ ( _Yt_ ∆ _y, κ_ ) _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ )
_−_ _−_



) _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _φ_ ( _Yt_ + ∆ _y, κ_ )
_−_ + _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) and _−_

∆ _y_ ∆ _y_



+ _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _,_ (5)
∆ _y_



and they are positive only when _φ_ is convex in the reserves _Yt_, which is ensured by Assump
tion 1(iii).

Assumption 1-3 also guarantees that the marginal price _∂_ 1 _φ_ is strictly decreasing in
_−_
the reserves, because



and



_∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) =
_−∂_ _[∂]_ [2] 1 _f_ _[f]_ ( [(] _φ_ _[φ]_ ( [(] _y, κ_ _[y, κ]_ ) [)] _, y_ _[, y]_ ) [)] [=] _[ −][R]_ [(] _[φ]_ [(] _[y, κ]_ [)] _[, y]_ [)] _[,]_


_∂_ 11 _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) = _∂_ 1 _R_ ( _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) _, y_ ) _R_ ( _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) _, y_ ) _∂_ 2 _R_ ( _φ_ ( _y, κ_ ) _, y_ ) _._
_−_



Thus, as LTs sell (resp. buy) the asset _Y_ to the DEX, the reserves in asset _Y_ increase

(resp. decrease) and the marginal price decreases (resp. increases).

Moreover, the convexity of the level function ensures that the trading costs (5) are in
creasing in the quantity ∆ _y_ bought or sold by the LT. This is akin to limit order books where

the cost of walking the book increases with the traded quantity. Finally, Assumption 1(iii)

imply that the costs in (5) are decreasing in the liquidity depth _κ_, so lower levels of reserves

make trading more expensive for LTs. This property is central to the trade-offs faced by LPs

in DEXs: higher reserve levels reduce trading costs for LTs and attract organic, profitable

order flow. However, as discussed below, they also increase the LP’s exposure to adverse

selection costs.


6The execution price here refers to the amount of the reference asset that the LP receives per unit of the
risky asset sold.

**Liquidity provision rewards.** In addition to the liquidity costs arising from the convexity
of the level function, LTs also pay a proportional fee _π ∈_ (0 _,_ 1) to LPs when transacting
in the DEX. Specifically, for a desired buy quantity ∆ _y_ of asset _Y_, an additional amount
_π_ ∆ _y Ft_ of the reference asset is paid to LPs. Similarly, for a desired sell quantity ∆ _y_, a
portion _π_ ∆ _y Ft_ of the amount received from the DEX is kept by LPs. Thus, liquidity-taking

activity generates fee revenue for LPs and incentivises increasing the reserves supplied to the

DEX.


**Liquidity position.** Next, we describe the dynamics of the LP’s reserves in DEXs. In the
remainder of this paper, we work on a filtered probability space (Ω _, F,_ F = ( _Ft_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,T_ ] _,_ P)
satisfying the usual conditions. Denote by ( _Ft_ ) _t_ 0 the fundamental price of the risky asset in
_≥_
units of the reference asset _X_ . We assume that the price _F_ follows the stochastic differential

equation (SDE)
d _Ft_ = _At Ft_ d _t_ + _σ Ft_ d _Wt,_ (6)


where _F_ 0 _>_ 0 is known, _W_ is an F-Brownian motion, _σ >_ 0 is a volatility parameter, and
�� _T_                              _A_ = ( _At_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,T_ ] is a progressively measurable process satisfying E 0 _[|][A][t][|][p]_ [ d] _[t]_ _< ∞_ for some
_p >_ 2. In our model, the process _A_ represents the LP’s stochastic private signal. [7]

In this work, we assume arbitrageurs continuously align the pool’s marginal price _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ )
_−_
with the fundamental value _Ft_ so


_Ft_ = _−∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _._


Assumption 1(iv) ensures that _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _, κ_ ) is a _C_ [2] -diffeomorphism from (0 _,_ ) to (0 _,_ ), and
_−_ _·_ _∞_ _∞_
therefore admits an inverse _h_ ( _·, κ_ ) which is _C_ [2] on (0 _, ∞_ ), so [8]


_Ft_ = _−∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _⇐⇒_ _Yt_ = _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) _._ (7)


By Itô’s formula, the dynamics of the value of the DEX reserves in units of the reference

asset _X_ are



_d_ ( _Xt_ + _Yt Ft_ ) = _d_ ( _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _−_ _Yt ∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ))

7The private signal of the LP may be observable, partially observable, or fully latent. Examples include
filtering the LT order flow or using price predictors.

(7) is well defined.

The term _Yt_ d _Ft_ on the right-hand side of (8) is commonly regarded as the source of risk
for a liquidity position with exogenously fixed initial reserves _Y_ 0. LPs who short a portfolio
in a frictionless CEX that fully replicates their position _Yt_ in the DEX are subject to the

negative and predictable loss term on the right-hand side of (8). This term, known as the

loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) or convexity cost, is commonly interpreted as a measure of

adverse selection costs in DEXs, which must be compensated by rewards in the form of fee

revenue; see Milionis et al. (2022).

In particular, the expected losses to arbitrageurs in (8) are increasing in the depth of

liquidity _κ_ and the volatility _σ_ . Thus, the adverse selection component incentivises LPs to

reduce the reserves they provide to the DEX.


**The model.** In contrast to existing characterisations of the viability of liquidity provision,

this paper determines the endogenous distribution of LP performance when the LP offsets

all or part of her risk in a CEX, at a cost and according to her risk preferences and private

information. We also characterise the associated equilibrium depth of liquidity in the DEX

and the resulting trading volumes.

The following sections introduce and solve a three-stage model that captures the strategic

interactions between LPs and LTs in a DEX. In Stage one, the LP chooses the optimal level

of reserves to deposit in the DEX. In Stage two, the LP determines her optimal replication

strategy in the CEX. In Stage three, arbitrageurs and noise LTs trade in the DEX.

We solve the model by backward induction. Section II solves stage three, where LTs take

the liquidity depth _κ_ as given and determine their optimal trading volumes by balancing

DEX trading costs and utility from transacting. These volumes in turn generate fee revenue

earned by the LP. Section III solves stage two, where the LP takes the liquidity depth _κ_

as given and determines her optimal CEX replication strategy to balance (i) replication

penalties scaled by the LP’s risk aversion, (ii) CEX trading costs, and (iii) private signals.

Finally, Section IV solves stage one, where the LP anticipates the effects of her trading in

the CEX and the activity of both arbitrageurs and noise LTs, to determine the optimal level

of DEX reserves.

### **II. Stage three: trading volumes**

#### _A. Assumptions_


The timing of stage three corresponds to the LP’s investment window [0 _, T_ ]. Throughout

this window, two types of LTs interact with the DEX. First, arbitrageurs continuously align

the pool’s price _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) with the fundamental value _Ft_ ; for simplicity, we do not account
_−_


9


for the fee revenue generated by their activity. Second, LTs with elastic demand for the asset

trade against the pool. We assume that demand is symmetric, i.e., the number of buyers

equals the number of sellers in expectation.

Assume an LT arrives to the DEX at time _t_, and that her private utility for the asset
is _V._ If _V >_ 0 and the LT wishes to buy a quantity _δ >_ 0 of asset _Y_, her execution costs
consist of (i) the execution costs (3) implied by the liquidity supply _κ_ and (ii) the fees _π δ Ft_

paid to LTs. Thus, the execution price is


_φ_ ( _Yt −_ _δ, κ_ ) _−_ _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) + _π δ Ft_ _._

_δ_


In our model, noise LTs use the following second-order approximation of the execution

price:



_φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) + _π δ Ft_ [1] 2

_δ_ _≈_ _[−][δ ∂]_ [1] _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [) +]



_φ_ ( _Yt_ _δ, κ_ ) _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) + _π δ Ft_
_−_ _−_




[1]

2 _[δ]_ [2] _[∂]_ [11] _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [) +] _[ π δ F][t]_



(9)
_δ_



= _Ft_ + _π Ft_ + 2 [1] _[δ ∂]_ [11] _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [)] _[ .]_



As shown in Cartea et al. (2025); Drissi (2023), this approximation is accurate in practice. [9]


In particular, the approximation captures the key economic effect that execution prices

worsen as liquidity depth _κ_ decreases, because the convexity term _∂_ 11 _φ_ is decreasing in _κ_ by

Assumption 1(iii).

Similarly, if _V <_ 0 and the LT wishes to sell the quantity _δ >_ 0 of asset _Y_, her execution

price is
_φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _φ_ ( _Yt_ + _δ, κ_ ) _π δ Ft_
_−_ _−_ _Ft_ _π Ft_ [1] _[δ ∂]_ [11] _[φ]_ [ (] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [)] _[ .]_ (10)

(10)
2 _[δ ∂]_ [11] _[φ]_ [ (] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [)] _[ .]_


#### _B. Liquidity needs_

Noise LTs have random liquidity needs and take the liquidity depth _κ_ in the DEX,

determined by the LP in stage 1, as given. To model the random liquidity needs of an LT
arriving at time _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ], we assume that she has a private utility for holding the asset in
the form of a private valuation of the risky asset. In our model, the noise LT’s utility from
holding one unit of the risky asset is _Ft_ (1+ _V_ ), where _V_ is the realization of a random variable
symmetrically distributed around zero and independent of all other processes. Specifically,
we assume that the distribution of _|V |_ is supported on the compact interval [ _π,_ 1], and we

problem with an analytical solution.


10


denote
_v_ = E[ _|V |_ ] _._

Thus, an LT observing _V ≥_ _π_ (resp. _V ≤−π_ ) wishes to buy (resp. sell) the asset. We assume
that the proportional utility _|V |_ exceeds _π_ to ensure positive trading volumes. Moreover,
note that E[ _V_ ] = 0, so the expected cumulative trading volume of noise LTs, from the

perspective of the LP, is zero.

#### _C. Trading volumes_


If an LT arrives at the DEX at time _t_, then she determines her optimal trading volume _δt_ _[⋆]_
by trading off execution costs (9)–(10) against her private utility for the asset. Specifically,

the noise LT’s performance criterion, when buying or selling a quantity _δ >_ 0, is given by


_δ_               - _V_ _π_               - _Ft_
_|_ _| −_ _−_ 2 [1] _[δ]_ [2] _[ ∂]_ [11] _[φ]_ [ (] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [)] _[,]_


which is maximised with
_V_ _π_
_δt_ _[⋆]_ [=] _[ F][t]_ _∂_ 11 _|_ _φ | −_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _[.]_


The trading volume of a noise LT can be written as a function of (i) the liquidity depth

_κ_ and (ii) the current level of reserves _Yt_, both of which determine the convexity of the level

function. Accordingly, we write


_V_ _π_
_δt_ _[⋆]_ [=] _[ δ][⋆]_ [(] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [) =] _|_ _| −_
_∂_ 11 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) _[∂]_ [1] _[φ]_ [(] _[Y][t][, κ]_ [)] _[ .]_


Using the equivalence (7), we may also express noise LT trading volumes as a function of

the depth _κ_ and the fundamental price _Ft_ :


_V_ _π_
_δt_ _[⋆]_ [=] _[ δ][⋆]_ [(] _[F][t][, κ]_ [) =] _|_ _| −_
_∂_ 11 _φ_ ( _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) _, κ_ ) _[F][t][ .]_


We assume that, throughout the time window [0 _, T_ ], the number of noise LTs arriving to
the DEX follows a Poisson process ( _Nt_ ) _t_ [0 _,T_ ] with constant intensity _λ_ . Noise LTs therefore
_∈_
generate fee revenue at a stochastic rate, and the LP’s anticipated expected fee revenue in

stage one is



�� _T_
E _π δt_ _[⋆]_ _[F][t]_ _[dN][t]_

= _λ π_ ( _v −_ _π_ ) E 0



_Ft_ [2]    - _._
_∂_ 11 _φ_ ( _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) _, κ_ ) _[dt]_



We define the instantaneous rate of fee revenue from the perspective of the LP, and expressed


11


in units of the reference asset _X_, as a function of the fundamental price and liquidity depth:


Π _t_ = Π( _Ft, κ_ ) = _λ π_ ( _v −_ _π_ ) _Ft_ [2] (11)
_∂_ 11 _φ_ ( _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) _, κ_ ) _[.]_


The key economic force implied by the trading volumes (11) is that greater liquidity

depth attracts larger trading volumes because convexity costs are lower, thereby generating

higher fee revenue for LPs. In Stage 1, the LP anticipates that supplying more liquidity

increases fee income. However, as discussed below, higher liquidity also amplifies losses to

arbitrageurs.

### **III. Stage two: risk offsetting in the centralised** **exchange**


In this section, the LP takes as given the liquidity deposit _κ_ determined in stage one.

The liquidity position in the DEX is exposed to adverse selection costs, which increase with

market volatility. To manage the risk of her position and to exploit private information, the

LP trades in the CEX to maximise her total wealth accross the DEX and the CEX, subject

to risk constraints and trading costs.

#### _A. Assumptions_


In our model, the LP deposits reserves ( _X_ 0 _, Y_ 0) at time 0 into a DEX characterised by
a strictly convex level function _φ_, and withdraws liquidity at a terminal time _T >_ 0. We
assume that the LP remains passive over this interval. [10] The risky asset is also traded on a

CEX. The LP earns fee revenue from noise LTs trading in the DEX and manages the risk
exposure of her DEX position by trading in the CEX at rate _ν_ = ( _νt_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,T_ ]. Moreover, the
LP also exploits private information driving the fundamental price.
The risky asset’s mid-price _S_ _[ν]_ = ( _St_ _[ν]_ [)] _[t][∈]_ [[0] _[,T]_ []] [in the CEX has two components: the funda-]
mental price _F_ and a transient market impact _I_ _[ν]_ = ( _It_ _[ν]_ [)] _[t][∈]_ [[0] _[,T]_ []] [induced by the LP’s trades in]
the CEX. Formally,
_St_ _[ν]_ [=] _[ F][t]_ [+] _[ I]_ _t_ _[ν][,]_ _t_ [0 _, T_ ] _._
_∈_


10Active and high-frequency adjustments of liquidity positions are impractical on blockchains: such rebalancing would incur prohibitive gas fees, and on-chain transactions are exposed to predatory _bots_ that exploit
transaction public visibility.


12


The transient impact process _I_ _[ν]_ satisfies


               - _t_

so that




   - _t_

0



Here, _c >_ 0 measures the linear price of the LP’s trades, and _β >_ 0 is the resilience parameter

governing the decay of transient impact.

By Itô’s formula, the LP’s DEX reserves in asset _Y_ follow the dynamics



d _Yt_ = _∂_ 1 _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) d _Ft_ + [1] 2




[1]

2 _[∂]_ [11] _[h]_ [(] _[F][t][, κ]_ [) d] _[⟨][F]_ _[⟩][t]_

 = _∂_ 1 _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) _At Ft_ + _[σ]_ 2 [2]



= _Gt Ft_ d _t_ + _σ ∂_ 1 _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) _Ft_ d _Wt,_ (13)


where we define
_Gt_ := _∂_ 1 _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) _At_ + _[σ]_ 2 [2] _[∂]_ [11] _[h]_ [(] _[F][t][, κ]_ [)] _[ F][t][ .]_ (14)


The changes in the reserves in the risky asset _Y_ in (13) are driven by reserves changes due

to arbitrageurs continuously aligning the marginal price to its fundamental value.
In our model, we denote the LP’s wealth in the pool by ( _L_ _[ν]_ _t_ [)] _[t][∈]_ [[0] _[,T]_ []][, defined as]


              - _t_
_L_ _[ν]_ _t_ [:=] Π( _Fu, κ_ ) _du_ + _Xt_ + _Yt St_ _[ν][.]_

0


The first term represents the cumulative fee revenue paid by noise LTs, while the second and

third terms correspond to the mark-to-market value of the LP’s liquidity position valued

using the CEX price.

#### _B. The performance criterion_


The LP holds reserves _Xt, Yt_ in the DEX, and her inventory ( _Q_ _[ν]_ _t_ [)] _t_ [0 _,T_ ] [in the CEX is]

                  - _t_

Thus, her terminal holdings in the CEX are _Q_ _[ν]_ _T_ [, which she values at the terminal CEX price]
_ST_ _[ν]_ [. In our model, the LP maximises her terminal wealth subject to penalties for deviating]
from a perfect replication strategy, i.e., _Q_ _[ν]_ _t_ [=] _[ −][Y][t]_ [. Specifically, the LP’s performance crite-]

The first term in the performance criterion (16) represents the sum of the terminal values

of the LP’s inventory in the CEX and her reserves in the DEX. The second term captures

the proceeds from trading in the CEX, and the corresponding trading costs incurred by the

LP. We model these costs as a quadratic friction term governed by the cost parameter _η >_ 0,

which reflects the depth of liquidity in the CEX. Note that we assume the DEX operates as

a secondary market and does not influence equilibrium outcomes in the CEX.

The third term in (16) is a running penalty for deviating from a perfect replication

strategy. Here, _ϕ >_ 0 is a penalty parameter that scales the deviation cost; higher values of
_ϕ_ correspond to greater aversion to holding non-zero net exposure between the LP’s positions
in the DEX and the CEX. As _ϕ →∞_, the optimal strategy tends to the perfect replication
of the DEX’s reserves.

The criterion in (16) can be expressed entirely as a running reward under the following

set of assumptions, which we adopt in the remainder of the paper.

Examples satisfying Assumption 2(i) include all continuous Gaussian processes, while

constant product markets such as Uniswap is an example of a market that fulfills Assump
tion 2(ii).

#### _C. The optimal risk offsetting strategy_


In the remainder of this work, we make the following standing assumption.


**Assumption** 3: _c <_ 2 _η ϕ._

_[√]_

This assumption bounds the instantaneous impact of the LP’s trades on CEX prices

and ensures that such impacts are offset by sufficiently high trading costs and deviation

penalty. This prevents degenerate strategies that would otherwise push prices to infinity.

Assumption 3 is not very restrictive, as the parameter _ϕ_ is typically large to reflect the

LP’s preference for strategies that closely replicate the LP’s position in the DEX. Moreover,

trading costs _η_ associated with walking the book in the CEX are typically of a larger order
of magnitude than the impact parameter _c_ .

We take a variational approach to characterize the optimal replication strategy. To this

end, we obtain the following results:


**Proposition** 1: _Define the symmetric bounded linear operator_ Λ : _A_ 2 _→A_ 2 _by_

Λ := 2 _η_ + _β_ (I _[⊤]_ Q + Q _[⊤]_ I) _−_ _c_ (Q + Q _[⊤]_ ) + _ϕ_ Q _[⊤]_ Q (18)


_and b ∈A_ 2 _by_


_b_ := I _[⊤]_ ( _G F_ ) + ( _c_ _β_ I _[⊤]_ _ϕ_ Q _[⊤]_ )( _Y_ + _Q_ 0) + Q _[⊤]_ ( _A F_ ) _._ (19)

Proposition 4 shows that in the general case of a DEX with convex level function, the

replication strategy of the LP can be obtained efficiently by solving the associated differential

Riccati equation (22).

#### _D. No transient impact_


Here, we consider the case where the LP’s trading activity in the CEX is significantly

smaller than the overall market activity, so the LP’s transient price impact is negligible.
Specifically, we assume _c_ = 0, in which case _I_ _[ν]_ = 0 for any _ν_ . Under this assumption, the

LP’s optimisation problem is solved explicitly in the following result.

### **IV. Stage one: liquidity supply**


In the previous section, we derived the optimal stage two replication strategy _νt_ _[⋆]_ [in the]
CEX for an arbitrary initial position _Q_ 0 and an arbitrary depth of liquidity _κ_, corresponding
to initial DEX reserves _Y_ 0 = _h_ ( _F_ 0 _, κ_ ). To determine the optimal liquidity depth _κ_ _[⋆]_ in
stage one, the LP anticipates that (i) she will execute her optimal strategy in the CEX at

a cost, (ii) trading volumes will respond endogenously to the level of liquidity she supplies,

and (iii) adverse selection losses increase with the amount of liquidity deposited in the DEX.
For simplicity, we assume that the LP starts with a CEX position _Q_ 0 = _−Y_ 0 = _−h_ ( _F_ 0 _, κ_ ).
This assumption facilitates comparisons of performance and risk across different values of

the model primitives: CEX trading costs _η_, risk aversion _ϕ_, and the profitability parameters
_{λ, v, π}_ .
Let _St_ _[⋆]_ [,] _[ Q]_ _t_ _[⋆]_ [, and] _[ L][⋆]_ _t_ [be the price, inventory, and DEX wealth when the LP executes the]
optimal strategy _νt_ _[⋆]_ [in the CEX, where]


             - _t_
_L_ _[⋆]_ _t_ [:=] Π( _Fu, κ_ ) d _u_ + _Xt_ + _Yt St_ _[⋆]_ _[,]_

and Π is defined in (11). In the general case, the optimisation problem of stage one is

### **V. Constant product markets**


To study the implications of risk offsetting in CEXs for liquidity supply and trading in

DEXs, we examine the equilibrium outcomes in constant product markets (CPMs) such as

Uniswap. In this setting, the level function is


_φ_ ( _Y, κ_ ) = _[κ]_ [2] (27)

_Y_ _[,]_


and the corresponding fundamental price and reserves satisfy


_κ_

_Ft_ = _∂_ 1 _φ_ ( _Yt, κ_ ) = _[κ]_ [2] and _Yt_ = _h_ ( _Ft, κ_ ) = _._ (28)
_−_ _Yt_ [2] ~~_√_~~ _Ft_


For simplicity, we assume that the LP is a sufficiently small agent whose trades do not

generate transient price impact, that is, we set _c_ = 0 in (12).

#### _A. Without private information_

Assume that the liquidity provider does not use private information and that the fun
damental price evolves according to (6) with _A_ = 0. The following result characterises the

equilibrium liquidity supply, trading volumes, and the LP’s strategy in the CEX. The result

below is a special case of Proposition 8 and we omit the proof.

Next, we show how model primitives influence market outcomes in CPMs. Namely,


21


we study the effect of CEX trading costs _η_, risk aversion _ϕ_, fundamental volatility _σ_, and
profitability _γ._


**Liquidity supply.** In CPMs, the equilibrium liquidity _κ_ _[⋆]_ in (31), when the LP dynamically
manages her risk in a CEX, takes the no-CEX liquidity _κ_ in (29) as a reference, and scales
it by the coefficient _c_
_σ_ [2] B+ _c_ [.]
The reference liquidity _κ_ does not depend on the trading costs _η_ in the CEX and is
decreasing in the aversion parameter _ϕ_ because without access to a CEX, reducing risk

exposure is only possible by reducing the size of liquidity supply. In contrast, the scaling

coefficient depends on both aversion and CEX costs, and it does so only through their ratio

_β_ = _ϕ/η_ . Specifically, both aversion and trading costs represent forms of disutility to the

LP; see (K). The disutility associated with CEX trading costs discourages active replication

of the LP’s position, whereas the disutility associated with risk aversion encourages active

replication. Ultimately, the ratio of these disutilities determines the equilibrium level of

liquidity supply and, as we show below, also shapes the LP’s behaviour in the CEX. Figure 1

showcases the liquidity supplies (31) and (29), with and without access to a CEX, as a

function of model primitives.

in (29) (blue curves), plotted as functions of the model primitives. Default parameter values
are: fundamental volatility _σ_ = 0 _._ 1, investment horizon _T_ = 1, private signal _A_ = 0, CEX
trading cost _η_ = 10 _[−]_ [2], ratio _β_ = _ϕ/η_ = 10, and profitability _γ_ = 0 _._ 2.


The first panel illustrates the dependence of CPM liquidity according to the ratio _β_ of
risk aversion to CEX trading costs (for fixed _η_ ). As this ratio increases, the disutility from

not closely replicating the DEX position outweighs the disutility generated by CEX trading

costs. In this case, the LP more tightly replicates her position in the DEX, as illustrated in

more detail in Figure 2a. Moreover, to further decrease the disutility associated with risk

exposure, the LP reduces the size of her liquidity supply.

Moreover, the first panel of Figure 1 also shows that the LP increases the scaling applied

to the reference liquidity _κ_ as the ratio _β_ rises. The intuition is as follows. The optimal

offsetting strategy effectively reduces the disutility from deviations between CEX and DEX


22


**(a)** _η_ = 10 _[−]_ [2]



**(b)** _η_ = 10 _[−]_ [1]



**Figure 2.** Each figure 2a and 2b plots a sample path of the LP’s reserves _Yt_ held in the
DEX and the inventory _Qt_ held in the CEX (top panels), together with their corresponding
values expressed in units of the reference asset _X_ (bottom panels). The left panels of each
figure correspond to a ratio of risk aversion to trading costs _β_ = 10, while the right panels
correspond to _β_ = 10 [3] . Other default parameter values are profitability _γ_ = 0 _._ 1, fundamental
volatility _σ_ = 0 _._ 2, and investment horizon _T_ = 0 _._ 3.


positions, and this benefit becomes increasingly valuable as risk aversion _ϕ_ grows relative
to the trading cost _η_ . Anticipating this, the LP applies a higher scaling to the reference

liquidity.

The second panel of Figure 1 shows that, for a fixed ratio _β_, higher trading costs _η_ reduce

equilibrium DEX liquidity. The underlying economic force is that dynamic replication in the

CEX, at the intensity implied by the ratio _β_, becomes more costly as _η_ increases. The LP

anticipates these higher costs by decreasing her DEX exposure, which reduces the amount

of CEX trading required to replicate her position.

This mechanism is further illustrated in Figure 2b. Figures 2a and 2b together show

that the degree with which the LP replicates her position in the CEX is governed by the

ratio _β_, while the overall level of liquidity supply decreases as CEX trading costs or aversion
increases (holding _β_ fixed).

Finally, the third panel of Figure 1 shows that fundamental price volatility decreases

liquidity, and the last panel shows that greater profitability of liquidity demand increases it.

In our model, the profitability increases with the fee rate _π_, the arrival intensity of noise LTs
_λ_, and the average absolute liquidity need _v_ .


**Risks and returns.** Next, we study the equilibrium risks and returns of liquidity provision

in a CPM as a function of model primitives. Specifically, we study the LP’s relative change

in wealth when she offsets her risk in the CEX, which we compute as follows. Recall that the
LP starts with a neutral cumulative CEX–DEX position in asset _Y_, satisfying _Q_ 0 + _Y_ 0 = 0,
and with an initial DEX position in the reference asset _X_ equal to _X_ 0 = _κ_ _F_ 0. When the

_[√]_


23


LP executes her optimal CEX strategy, her change in wealth, measured in units of _X_, is

where _νt_ _[⋆]_ [is the optimal trading rate in the CEX and] _[ Q]_ _t_ _[⋆]_ [the corresponding inventory. To]
obtain the relative change in the LP’s wealth, we normalise (32) by the initial cash position
_X_ 0 = _κ_ _[⋆][√]_ _F_ 0.
Note that the expected change in the value of the LP’s DEX liquidity position is


E �2 _κ_ _[⋆]_ ( _FT_ [1] _[/]_ [2] _F_ 0 [1] _[/]_ [2] )� = _F_ 0 [1] _[/]_ [2]         - _e_ _[−][σ]_ [2] _[ T/]_ [8] 1� _,_ (33)

which is always negative. The viability of DEX liquidity provision depends on whether the

stage-three fee revenue, adjusted by replication costs and the proceeds form risk offsetting,

covers the adverse selection costs (33).
When the LP does not offset her exposure in the CEX, i.e., when _ν ≡_ 0, her inventory
in the CEX remains constant, _Qt_ = _Q_ 0, and the expected change in her wealth is

Comparing (32) and (34) isolates the effect of dynamic risk offsetting in the CEX: it reduces
inventory risk at the expense of trading frictions _η νt_ [2][, but it may also alter expected fee]
revenue and terminal payoffs through the adjusted liquidity choice _κ_ _[⋆]_ studied above. Figure 3

illustrates these effects by plotting the distribution of the profit and loss of DEX liquidity

provision as a function of model primitives.

Figure 3 highlights a first-order economic effect of risk offsetting on the viability of liq
uidity provision in DEXs. While the expected adverse selection losses to arbitrageurs in (33)

are unaffected by the LP’s trading in the CEX, the variance of these losses decreases as the

ratio _β_ increases and replication becomes more aggressive. At the same time, the trading

costs generated by the LP’s activity in the CEX increase with the intensity of replication.

Consequently, the viability of DEX liquidity provision is shaped by (i) the LP’s aversion to

risk, which determine the trading costs incurred in the CEX, and by (ii) fee revenue. In

particular, Figure 3 shows that beyond a threshold level of risk aversion, liquidity provision

is no longer viable and DEX markets shut down.

**Figure 3.** Distribution of the equilibrium adverse selection and trading costs (top panels) and the equilibrium payoff of liquidity provision (bottom panels). The distribution is
obtained from 2000 market simulations, with the time interval discretised into 1000 steps.
Default parameter values are _σ_ = 0 _._ 1, _T_ = 1, _A_ = 0, _η_ = 10 _[−]_ [2], _β_ = 10, and _γ_ = 0 _._ 25.


The second column of panels in Figure 3 shows that the equilibrium percentage returns

and risk of liquidity provision depend only on the ratio of risk aversion to trading costs,

and not on the absolute level of either parameter. The intuition is that the LP adjusts

the aggressiveness of risk offsetting according to the ratio _β_, while she adjusts the level of

liquidity supply according to the absolute level of risk aversion. As a result, returns and risks

of liquidity provision, when measured relative to the LP’s initial wealth, are driven solely by

the ratio _β_ .

The third column of Figure 3 shows that higher fundamental price volatility substantially

increases adverse selection costs, thereby undermining the viability of liquidity provision in

CPMs. In contrast, the final column illustrates how the profitability of noise demand affects

the returns and risks of liquidity provision. As profitability _γ_ increases, the LP is willing to

supply more liquidity (see Figure 1) and to bear greater inventory risk, and the incentive

to offset large positions at quadratic cost in the CEX diminishes. In equilibrium, although

adverse selection losses and inventory risk rise, they are more than compensated by higher

fee revenue.


25


#### _B. Risk offsetting and private information_

Here, we assume that the LP employs a private signal driving the drift of the fundamental

price of asset _Y_ . The equilibrium liquidity supplies, with and without risk offsetting, are

characterised in the following result.

The next result shows that Proposition 8 applies to the popular case in which the private

signal _A_ follows an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with dynamics


d _At_ = _θ_ ( _µ −_ _At_ ) _dt_ + _ξ dWt ._ (38)


**Lemma** 4: _The processes defined in_ (36) _are martingales if A is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_
_process with dynamics_ (38) _._


**Proof** Appendix A.L.


The equilibrium liquidity supply (37) takes the liquidity level (35) as a reference, adjusts

it upward or downward depending on the value of the private signal, and then applies a

scaling that depends on the ratio _β_ of risk aversion to trading costs. The dependence of
liquidity supply on _β_, trading costs _η_, volatility _σ_, and profitability _γ_ is qualitatively similar

to that studied in the previous section. Figure 4 considers the simple case of constant signal

_A_ and examines how equilibrium liquidity supply varies with the LP’s private information.

Figure 4 shows that, counterintuitively, private information does not systematically lead

to higher performance or deeper markets. For moderate positive values of the fundamental

price drift, the LP anticipates that, in addition to fee revenue, the positive drift will improve

performance, and therefore increases liquidity supply relative to the zero-drift benchmark.

However, for large absolute values of the signal, the LP anticipates that replicating the

position in the CEX will require more intensive trading and generate higher trading costs.

Anticipating these costs, she reduces her liquidity supply.

The extent of this reduction increases with the ratio _β_, as illustrated in Figure 4. When
_β_ is large, equilibrium liquidity supply is lower and the LP anticipates reduced CEX trading
activity. As a result, the range of signal values _A_ for which liquidity supply exceeds the

reference level widens.

### **VI. Conclusions**


This paper builds a structural model of liquidity provision in DEXs in which arbitrageurs

align DEX prices with fundamentals, thereby generating adverse selection losses for LPs,

while noise and elastic demand generates fee revenue. We show that, once trading volumes

and liquidity supply are endogenised, the losses and risks borne by liquidity providers are

not summarised by any single measure. Instead, they depend on (i) market conditions,

including CEX liquidity depth, fundamental volatility, and noise trading activity, and on

(ii) the LP’s risk aversion, which ultimately shapes the distribution of returns from DEX

liquidity provision.

#### _Appendix B. Proof of Lemma 3_


The proof proceeds in four steps. First, we show that the performance criterion (16) is well-defined and

continuous. Next, we show that the functional _J_ in (17) is also well-defined and continuous. Next, we show
that the performance criterion (16) and _J_ in (17) agree up to a constant on bounded processes. Finally, we

conclude.


**Step 1.** First, we show that the performance criterion (16) is well-defined and continuous. Take _ν_ 2.

on _A_ 2, the quadratic form _Q_ is well-defined and continuous. Because we know _F ∈A_ 2 by Lemma 1, it remains
to show the processes _G F_ and _A F_ are in 2. Indeed, if _q_ (2 _, p_ ), then

**Step 4.** Because bounded processes are dense in 2, by continuity, (A1) holds for all _ν_ 2.
_A_ _∈A_

#### _Appendix C. Proof of Proposition 1_


Consider the quadratic form _Q_ and the linear functional _L_ defined in Lemma 3. Define the symmetric
bounded bilinear form _B_ : 2 2 R by
_A_ _× A_ _→_

_B_ ( _ν, ζ_ ) = [1]

4 [(] _[Q]_ [(] _[ν]_ [ +] _[ ζ]_ [)] _[ −Q]_ [(] _[ν][ −]_ _[ζ]_ [))] _[ .]_


32


Then



_B_ ( _ν, ζ_ ) = 2 _η ⟨ν, ζ⟩_ + _β_ ( _⟨_ Q _ν,_ I _ζ⟩_ + _⟨_ Q _ζ,_ I _ν⟩_ ) _−_ _c_ ( _⟨_ Q _ν, ζ⟩_ + _⟨_ Q _ζ, ν⟩_ ) + _ϕ ⟨_ Q _ν,_ Q _ζ⟩_



= 2 _η ⟨ν, ζ⟩_ + _β_ ( _⟨_ I _[⊤]_ Q _ν, ζ⟩_ + _⟨ζ,_ Q _[⊤]_ I _ν⟩_ ) _−_ _c_ ( _⟨_ Q _ν, ζ⟩_ + _⟨ζ,_ Q _[⊤]_ _ν⟩_ ) + _ϕ ⟨_ Q _[⊤]_ Q _ν, ζ⟩_



= _⟨_ (2 _η_ + _β_ (I _[⊤]_ Q + Q _[⊤]_ I) _−_ _c_ (Q + Q _[⊤]_ ) + _ϕ_ Q _[⊤]_ Q) _ν, ζ⟩_



= _⟨_ Λ _ν, ζ⟩_


and
_Q_ ( _ν_ ) = _B_ ( _ν, ν_ ) = _⟨_ Λ _ν, ν⟩_ _._

For the linear functional _L_, we have


_L_ ( _ν_ ) = _⟨_ (I _[⊤]_ ( _G F_ ) + ( _c −_ _β_ I _[⊤]_ _−_ _ϕ_ Q _[⊤]_ ) + Q _[⊤]_ ( _A F_ ) _, ν⟩_ = _⟨b, ν⟩_ _._



Therefore,

#### _Appendix G. Proof of Proposition 4_


First, we show we may construct a solution of the FBSDE from a solution of the DRE. Suppose _P_
is a solution to the DRE (22) and the processes _ℓ_, Φ, Ψ are defined as stated in the proposition. Let us
differentiate these processes. For Φ, we have


                          - _t_                           - _t_
dΦ _t_ = ( _B_ 12 _P_ ( _t_ ) + _B_ 11) Φ _t_ d _t_ + _e_ 0 [(] _[B]_ [12] _[ P]_ [ (] _[u]_ [)+] _[B]_ [11][) d] _[u]_ _e_ _[−]_ 0 [(] _[B]_ [12] _[ P]_ [ (] _[u]_ [)+] _[B]_ [11][) d] _[u]_ _B_ 12 _ℓt_ d _t_


= ( _B_ 12 ( _P_ ( _t_ ) Φ _t_ + _ℓt_ ) + _B_ 11 Φ _t_ ) d _t_


= ( _B_ 12 Ψ _t_ + _B_ 11 Φ _t_ ) d _t ._


For _ℓ_, we have




           
     - _t_

By generalized Itô’s formula,


                          - _t_                          - _t_                          d _ℓt_ = _−_ ( _P_ ( _t_ ) _B_ 12 _−_ _B_ 22) _ℓt_ d _t_ + _e_ _[−]_ 0 [(] _[P]_ [ (] _[u]_ [)] _[ B]_ [12] _[−][B]_ [22][) d] _[u]_ [ �] d _M_ [˜] _t_ + _e_ 0 [(] _[P]_ [ (] _[u]_ [)] _[ B]_ [12] _[−][B]_ [22][) d] _[u]_ _bt_ d _t_

                             - _t_
= (( _−P_ ( _t_ ) _B_ 12 + _B_ 22) _ℓt_ + _bt_ ) d _t_ + _e_ _[−]_ 0 [(] _[P]_ [ (] _[u]_ [)] _[ B]_ [12] _[−][B]_ [22][) d] _[u]_ d _M_ [˜] _t ._



Let




   - _t_    - _s_
_Mt_ = 0 _e_ _[−]_ 0 [(] _[P]_ [ (] _[u]_ [)] _[ B]_ [12] _[−][B]_ [22][) d] _[u]_ d _M_ [˜] _s ._



Since the integrand is deterministic and differentiable and because of (A7), _M_ is an R [2] -valued martingale
with E[ _T_ ] [2] _<_ . For Ψ, we have
_|M_ _|_ _∞_


dΨ _t_ = _P_ _[′]_ ( _t_ ) Φ _t_ d _t_ + _P_ ( _t_ ) dΦ _t_ + d _ℓt_

= _P_ _[′]_ ( _t_ ) Φ _t_ d _t_ + _P_ ( _t_ ) ( _B_ 11 Φ _t_ + _B_ 12 ( _P_ ( _t_ ) Φ _t_ + _ℓt_ )) d _t_ + d _ℓt_

= ( _P_ _[′]_ ( _t_ ) + _P_ ( _t_ ) _B_ 11 + _P_ ( _t_ ) _B_ 12 _P_ ( _t_ )) Φ _t_ d _t_ + _P_ ( _t_ ) _B_ 12 _ℓt_ d _t_ + d _ℓt_

= ( _B_ 21 + _B_ 22 _P_ ( _t_ )) Φ _t_ d _t_ + _P_ ( _t_ ) _B_ 12 _ℓt_ d _t_ + (( _−P_ ( _t_ ) _B_ 12 + _B_ 22) _ℓt_ + _bt_ ) d _t_ + d _Mt_

= ( _B_ 21 Φ _t_ + _B_ 22 ( _P_ ( _t_ ) Φ _t_ + _ℓt_ ) + _bt_ ) d _t_ + d _Mt_

= ( _B_ 21 Φ _t_ + _B_ 22 Ψ _t_ + _bt_ ) d _t_ + d _Mt ._


Thus we obtain the FBSDE



 dΦ _t_ = ( _B_ 11 Φ _t_ + _B_ 12 Ψ _t_ ) d _t,_ Φ0 = _K_


 dΨ _t_ = ( _B_ 21 Φ _t_ + _B_ 22 Ψ _t_ + _bt_ ) d _t_ + d _Mt,_ Ψ _T_ = _G_ Φ _T_ + _L_

#### _Appendix H. Proof of Proposition 5_

The LP’s optimisation problem reduces to solving the following simplified FBSDE:


       - d _νt_ =       - 2 _ϕ η_ _[Q][t]_ [ +] _[−][A][t][ F]_ 2 _η_ _[t]_ [+] _[ϕ Y][t]_       - d _t_ + 21 _η_ [d] _[M][t][,]_ _νT_ = 0

d _Qt_ = _νt_ d _t,_


and the ansatz _νt_ = _P_ ( _t_ ) _Qt_ + _ℓt_ gives the equations


_P_ _[′]_ ( _t_ ) = _−P_ ( _t_ ) [2] + 2 _ϕ η_ _[,]_ _P_ ( _T_ ) = 0 (A12)


and
d _ℓt_ =           - _−P_ ( _t_ ) _ℓt_ + _[−][A][t][ F]_ 2 _η_ _[t]_ [+] _[ϕ Y][t]_           - d _t_ + 21 _η_ [d] _[M][t][,]_ _ℓT_ = 0 (A13)


The solution of (A12) is




   2 _ϕ η_ [(] _[t][ −]_ _[T]_ [)] _._




  _P_ ( _t_ ) =



_ϕ_ - ~~�~~
2 _η_ [tanh]



To solve (A13), we define

Similarly, _Q_ is obtained by solving the equation
