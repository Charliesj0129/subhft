> for direct estimation of implied term stru ctures of survival probabilities from credit bond prices. We have shown that this methodolog y is more robust than the traditional implementations of reduced-form default models (for the latter, see Jarrow and Turnbull [1995], and Duffie and Singleton [1999]). Mor e importantly, it is more consistent with the underlying bankruptcy resolution practices such as debt acceleration and equal priority recovery for the same-seniority bonds. Our methodology is well suited to a direct comparison with credit derivatives, particularly credit default swaps, whose valuation is driven by the model ing of default probabilities. In this paper we introduce new relative value measures, which take a dvantage of the internal consistency of this pricing methodology. In particular, we define: • Bond-Implied CDS (BCDS) term structure • CDS-Bond curve basis • Systematic and full bond-specific basis to CDS curve • Risk-free-equivalent coupon (RFC) streams for credit-risky bonds We also introduce and discuss static replication/hedging str ategies of credit risk in cash bonds using forward and spot CDS. In particular, we dem onstrate in detail how these strategies can be used to hedge the default risk of a credit b ond with an arbitrary coupon, given an arbitrary term structure of risk-free rates. The complete hedge of credit risk in these strategies is reflected in the complementarity between the risk-fr ee-equivalent coupon streams a...

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> S In the conclusion of our three-part series of papers we note that the survival-based pricing framework has important implications for all aspects of both the investment science and the practice of trading of credit-risky bonds. We have shown i n this series that all commonly used measures, including the Z-spreads, the interest rate and s pread durations, and the CDSBond basis, to name a few, are significantly affected and require a careful re-definition to maintain their consistency. The impact of the new methodology i s both qualitative, such as the revealing explanations of the “optical” spread curve invers ion and rates-spreads correlation, and quantitative, such as the estimates of the cor rect interest rate and credit sensitivities and CDS-Bond basis. We hope that the comprehensi ve set of methodologies presented in this series will assist the credit portfolio m anagers in the difficult task of understanding and harnessing the risks and rewards of this important asset class. Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Marco Naldi as well as many other colleagues at Lehman Brothers Fixed Income Research department for numerous h elpful discussions throughout the development and implementation of the survi val-based methodology during the past several years.

> In this paper, we consider a diﬀerent scenario where the basis does not vanish at maturity. More precisely, we model the stochastic basis by a scaled Brownian bridge that is stopped before its achieves convergence. Our proposed model is motivated by the market phenomenon of non-convergence as well as the possibility of traders closing their futures positions prior to maturity. It also has the added advantage that it generates an arbitrage-free futures market (see Proposition 2.5 below). We consider a general class of risk preferences by using hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility functions which includes power (CRRA) and exponential (CARA) utilities. We exclude, however, the case of decreasing risk-tolerance functions and, in particular, the quadratic utility function. Among our...

• **Abstract Reference**:
> We study the problem of dynamically trading a futures contract and its underlying asset under a stochastic basis model. The basis evolution is modeled by a stopped scaled Brownian bridge to account for non-convergence of the basis at maturity. The optimal trading strategies are determined from a utility maximization problem under hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) risk preferences. By analyzing the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, we derive the exact conditions under which the equation admits a solution and solve the utility maximization explicitly. A series of numerical examples are provided to illustrate the optimal strategies and examine the eﬀects of model parameters.

We ﬁrst decompose the trajectories on function basis, trading the initial inﬁnite dimension problem on a multivariate functional space for a parameter optimisation problem. A maximum a posteriori approach which incorporates information from data is used to obtain a new optimisation problem which is regularised. The penalised term focuses the search on a region centered on data and includes estimated linear constraints in the problem. We apply our data-driven approach to two settings in aeronautics and sailing routes optimisation, yielding commanding results.

As such, it has potential applications to many real world problems, such as in robotics to minimise the work-based speciﬁc mechanical cost of transport (Srinivasan and Ruina, 2006) or in aerospace to reduce the total thermal ﬂux when a space shuttle re-enters in the atmosphere (Tr´ elat, 2012). In aeronautics, optimisation problems are often formulated in terms of optimal control problems (Codina and Men´ endez, 2014; Girardet et al., 2014; Cots et al., 2018). They can be solved by converting the problem into a parameter optimisation problem. This allows to take into account the dynamics of the system, leading to realistic solutions complying with additional constraints (we refer to Rao, 2009, for an overview). Nevertheless the diﬀerential equations describing the dynamics of the system of interest may be (partially) unknown. For instance, the diﬀerential system describing the motion of an aircraft moving in an air mass (Rommel et al., 2019) involves the lift and drag forces for which no analytic formulas exist. Aircraft manufacturer computes numerical models by means of heavy simulations and wind tunnel tests. Another approach consists in 2 reconstructing unknown forces based on physical formulas and available ﬂight data; see for instance Rommel et al. (2017); Dewez et al. (2020) for...

To classic reduced form model theorists, the existence of the basis is an abnormality or merely liquidity noise.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> This paper develops a hierarchical games-in-games control architecture for hybrid stochastic systems governed by regime-switching jump-diffusions. We model the interplay between continuous state dynamics and discrete mode transitions as a bilevel differential game: an inner layer solves a robust stochastic control problem within each regime, while a strategic outer layer modulates the transition intensities of the underlying Markov chain. A Dynkin-based analysis yields a system of coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. We prove that for the class of Linear-Quadratic games and Exponential-Affine games, this hierarchy admits tractable semi-closed form solutions via coupled matrix differential equations. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on adversarial market microstructure, showing how the outer layer’s strategic switching pre-emptively adjusts inventory spreads against latent regime risks, which leads to a hyper-alert equilibrium. 1...

• **Model / Framework**:
> We consider a hybrid decision architecture in which a continuous state evolves according to mode-dependent stochastic dynamics, while a discrete mode process switches between a finite collection of regimes. Two layers of strategic decision-making interact: a fast-timescale controller/disturbance pair regulating the continuous state, and a slowtimescale pair of agents whose actions influence the transition rates among the discrete modes. This structure captures a wide range of multi-layer hybrid systems, including resilient infrastructure networks, multi-agent cyber-physical systems, and robust control under regime uncertainty. Let (Ω,F,P) be a complete probability space equipped with a filtration F= (F t)t≥0 satisfying the usual conditions of right-continuity and completeness. The time horizon is finite, T <∞ . We define the following primitive stochastic processes adapted toF: 1.W= (W t)t≥0 is a standardd-dimensional Brownian motion. 2 2.N(dt, dz) is a Poisson random measure on [0, T]× Z with intensity measure λ(dz)dt, where Z ⊆R k.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> This paper presents a hierarchical “games-in-games” control framework for systems governed byregime-switching jump-diffusions. By decomposing the problem into a fast inner game and a strategic outer game, we derived a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations via a unified Dynkin identity. A key theoretical contribution is the proof that for Exponential-Affine and Linear-Quadratic games, this hierarchy admits tractablespectral solutionsvia the matrix exponential, bridging the gap between hybrid modeling and computational feasibility. The framework’s practical value is demonstrated through an adversarial market microstructure case study. The results reveal aRisk Isomorphismprinciple, where the hierarchical controller naturally interprets strategic predation as effective volatility, inducing a “hyper-alert” equilibrium that pre-emptively widens spreads. Future research will extend this architecture to partially observable regimes and integrate data-driven learning for empirical transition kernels.

Using state-of-the-art pre-training data detection techniques, we estimate the likelihood that a given prompt appeared in an LLM’s training corpus, a statistic we term Lookahead Propensity (LAP). We formally show that a positive correlation between LAP and forecast accuracy indicates the presence and magnitude of lookahead bias, and apply the test to two forecasting tasks: news headlines predicting stock returns and earnings call transcripts predicting capital expenditures.

> is cost-efficient and requires neither model retraining nor access to proprietary training data. It offers researchers and practitioners a practical diagnostic tool for assessing the reliability 1 and real-world validity of LLM-generated forecasts. We first introduce the Lookahead Propensity (LAP), a measure of how likely the text in a prompt appeared in an LLM’s training data. For each prompt, we compute the model-assigned probability of every token conditional on its preceding tokens. We define LAP as the mean token probabilities of the bottomK% of tokens, i.e., those tokens with the lowest predicted probabilities. This focus on uncommon tokens is key: frequent words such as “the” or “and” are assigned high probabilities regardless of prior exposure, whereas rare tokens carry more information about whether the text was previously seen. The intuition is that unseen prompts tend to contain more low-probability (outlier) tokens under the model, whereas seen prompts are less likely to have such extreme outliers, and those tokens instead receive higher probability . Accordingly , a higher LAP indicates greater model familiarity and a higher likelihood of training-data overlap.1 The LAP corresponds directly to the MIN-K% PROB statistic developed in the membership inference attack (MIA) literature (e.g., Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2021, 2022; Shi et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024).

Conventional time-series and machine learning approaches, which rely primarily on historical correlations, often struggle to generalize when the economic environment changes.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> This paper introduces Alpha-R1, a semantics-driven approach to quantitative investment that shifts the focus from static factor mining to context-aware reasoning. Rather than relying solely on historical correlations, Alpha-R1 employs a reinforcement-learning–trained large language model to reason over the economic rationale underlying factor performance and its dependence on evolving market conditions. By constructing a dual-layer semantic context that integrates long-term market memory with real-time information, Alpha-R1 connects unstructured data sources with quantitative decisionmaking in a unified manner. Methodologically, we develop a marketaligned reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in which training is guided by objective market outcomes instead of subjective human feedback. Extensive empirical results show that Alpha-R1 consistently outperforms traditional machine learning baselines and generic reasoning LLMs across multiple asset pools. Notably, Alpha-R1 demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization when transferred from the CSI 300 to the CSI 1000 universe, maintaining stable and profitable performance in a previously unseen, high-volatility environment, where conventional reinforcement learning agents experience marked degradation. These findings suggest that grounding factor selection in semantic reasoning and market feedback provides a viable approach for mitigating alpha decay and addressing non-stationarity in financial markets.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Relative entropy, as a divergence metric between two distributions, can be used for offline change-point detection and extends classical methods that mainly rely on moment-based discrepancies. To build a statistical test suitable for this context, we study the distribution of empirical relative entropy and derive several types of approximations: concentration inequalities for finite samples, asymptotic distributions, and Berry-Esseen bounds in a pre-asymptotic regime. For the latter, we introduce a new approach to obtain Berry-Esseen inequalities for nonlinear functions of sum statistics under some convexity assumptions. Our theoretical contributions cover both one- and two-sample empirical relative entropies. We then detail a change-point detection procedure built on relative entropy and compare it, through extensive simulations, with classical methods based on moments or on information criteria.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> —In decentralized finance (DeFi), designing fixedincome lending automated market makers (AMMs) is extremely challenging due to time-related complexities. Moreover, existing protocols only support single-maturity lending. Building upon the BondMM protocol, this paper argues that its mathematical invariants are sufficiently elegant to be generalized to arbitrary maturities. This paper thus propose an improved design, BondMM-A, which supports lending activities of any maturity. By integrating fixed-income instruments of varying maturities into a single smart contract, BondMM-A offers users and liquidity providers (LPs) greater operational freedom and capital efficiency. Experimental results show that BondMMA performs excellently in terms of interest rate stability and financial robustness.

BondMM-A still invites optimization. Future work includes more precise dynamic parameter tuning for fast markets, richer yield-curve models to match real-world diversity, and stronger resilience to extremes. Real deployments will test performance and security at DeFi scale. Overall, BondMM-A offers a new design path for decentralized fixed income and a reference for subsequent research.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> We develop an economic model of decentralised exchanges (DEXs) in which riskaverse liquidity providers (LPs) manage risk in a centralised exchange (CEX) based on preferences, information, and trading costs. Rational, risk-averse LPs anticipate the frictions associated with replication and manage risk primarily by reducing the reserves supplied to the DEX. Greater aversion reduces the equilibrium viability of liquidity provision, resulting in thinner markets and lower trading volumes. Greater uninformed demand supports deeper liquidity, whereas higher fundamental price volatility erodes it. Finally, while moderate anticipated price changes can improve LP performance, larger changes require more intensive trading in the CEX, generate higher replication costs, and induce LPs to reduce liquidity supply. ∗F.

Specifically, they balance the trading costs implied by the LP’s reserves in the DEX against their private utility from holding the asset. Trading costs directly depend on the liquidity reserves deposited by the LP. Specifically, in DEXs, liquidity providers deposit capital into a pool that liquidity takers use to execute trades in exchange for a fee. The DEX functions as an algorithmic market maker whose price and liquidity dynamics are determined by the pricing rules encoded in the DEX’s smart contract,3 the amount of capital in the pool, and the trading fee. 3A smart contract is a publicly accessible and immutable program running on the blockchain that defines the rules of interaction with the pool for both liquidity providers and liquidity takers. 3 Instage two, the LP determines her optimal CEX risk offsetting strategy for an arbitrary level of liquidity supply. The strategy explicitly accounts for CEX trading costs, investment horizon, net exposure risk aversion, and private information. We employ variational methods to characterise and solve the optimal strategy in the setting of a DEX with an arbitrary convex bonding curve and when the LP’s trading activity generates both permanent and transient market impact.

Under the Timeboost policy, transactions are delivered to the sequencer through two distinct channels: the normal lane and the Express Lane (EL). While the sequencer processes transactions in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) manner, transactions submitted via the normal lane incur a200-millisecond delay before being forwarded to the sequencer. Conversely, the EL immediately forwards received transactions, thereby offering its users a200-millisecond latency advantage. The temporary right to utilize the EL is periodically allocated for each round—which lasts for one minute—via a second-price sealed-bid auction termed theExpress Lane Auction (ELA)3. This auction operates on an ahead-of-time basis; participants in the ELA are required to estimate the value of the good (the right to use the EL in the forthcoming round), submit their bids, and pay if they win, prior to exercising their EL access. Given that the latency differential is barely noticeable to typical users, participation and bidding in the ELA are 3 The winner may elect to either exclusively utilize this access or to share and resell it to other parties. For instance, [20] is currently running a secondary market that resells the EL access. arXiv:2512.23386v1 [c...

In contrast, centralized finance (CeFi) offers a more stable environment with institutional safeguards. Institutional backing can play a stabilizing role in a hybrid structure (HyFi), enhancing transparency, governance, and market discipline. This study investigates whether HyFi -like cryptocurrencies , those backed by institutions, exhibit lower price risk than fully decentralized counterparts. Using daily data for 18 major cryptocurrencies from January 2020 to November 2024, we estimate panel EGLS models with fixed, random, and dynamic specifications. Results show that HyFi -like assets consistently experience lower price risk, with this effect intensifying during periods of elevated market volatility. The negative interaction between HyFi status and market -wide volatility confirms their stabilizing role. Conversely, greater decentralization is strongly associated with increased volat...

> We demonstrate that the choice of normalization for order flow intensity is fundamental to signal extraction in finance, not merely a technical detail. Through theoretical modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, and empirical validation using 2.1 million stock-day observations from the Korean market, we prove that market capitalization normalization acts as a “matched filter” for informed trading signals, achieving 1.32– 1.92×higher correlation with future returns compared to traditional trading value normalization. The key insight is that informed traders scale positions by firm value (market capitalization), while noise traders respond to daily liquidity (trading volume), creating heteroskedastic corruption when normalizing by trading volume. By reframing the normalization problem using signal processing theory, we show that dividing order flow by market capitalization preserves the information signal while traditional volume normalization multiplies the signal by inverse turnover—a highly...

They explicitly measure institutional order flow as a percentage of total market capitalization, providing a direct precedent for ourS M C measure. Beber et al. (2011) investigate the information content of sector-level order flow. They explicitly define “active sector order flow” as the flow in excess of the proportion dictated by the sector’smarket capitalization. Mathematically, they calculate “passive” flow as the total market flow multiplied by the sector’s market cap weight (w i =M i/P Mj). This definition formalizes the idea that the “neutral” expectation for flow is proportional toM i, notV i. Any deviation from this cap-weighted baseline represents an active, potentially informed, view. Lewellen (2011) analyzes how institutional investors aggregate to affect asset prices. His findings suggest that institutions, constrained by benchmarks and capacity, allocate capital in ways that scale with firm size rather than daily trading activity. 2.3 Turnover as Uncertainty, Not Liquidity A key pillar of our argument is that turnover (V i/Mi) proxies for noise rather than information. If turnover were purely information-driven, normalizing by it might be justified.

We resolve this puzzle. Using Korean market data (2020-2024), we demonstrate that HVRP exists in Korea but is masked by (1) pooling heterogeneous investor types and (2) using inappropriate intensity normalization. When institutional buying intensity is normalized by market capitalization rather than trading value, a perfect monotonic relationship emerges: highest-conviction institutional buying (Q4) generates +12.12% cumulative abnormal returns over 50 days, while lowest-intensity trades (Q1) yield modest returns (+4.65%). Retail investors exhibit a flat pattern—their trading generates near-zero returns regardless of conviction level—confirming the pure noise trader hypothesis.

For institutional investors, events in the highest conviction quartile (measured as net buying relative to market capitalization) generate cumulative abnormal returns of+12.12%over 50 days, while the lowest quartile yields modest returns (4.65%). This perfect monotonic pattern (Q1<Q2<Q3<Q4) demonstratesthatintensitymattersprofoundly—butonlywhenmeasuredcorrectly. The critical methodological insight is thathow we normalize intensity determines whether we detect informed trading signals. When intensity is normalized by daily trading value (measuring participation in trading flow), the monotonic pattern breaks down completely (Q2: +12.77% > Q4: +3.64%). But when normalized by market capitalization (measuring conviction as position size relative to firm value), the relationship becomes crystal clear. This demonstrates that the near-zero correlation with the Dominance Score does not mean intensity is irrelevant; it means the relationship isnonlinear, typedependent, and critically sensitive to measurement specification. Prior studies may have missed this relationship by using inappropriate normalization benchmarks or failing to account for investor heterogeneity. Therefore, our study has four objectives. First, we replicate An et al. (2006)’s study with 2020-2024 data to verify whether the HVRP phenomenon rem...

While models such as GARCH and SV capture the stochastic nature of volatility, incorporating LSTM networks can enhance predictions by identifying non-linear patterns. This study addresses a gap in financial forecasting research by proposing a hybrid SV-LSTM model that leverages both the statistical strengths of SV and the pattern-recognition capacity of LSTM. The objective is to assess whether incorporating latent volatility estimates from an SV model as an additional input enhances the predictive performance of the LSTM model compared to their standalone applications.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Accurate volatility forecasting is essential in various domains, including banking, investment, and risk management, as expectations about future market movements directly influence current decision-making. This study proposes a hybrid modeling framework that integrates a Stochastic Volatility model with a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. The SV model contributes statistical precision and the ability to capture latent volatility dynamics, particularly in response to unforeseen events, while the LSTM network enhances the model’s ability to detect complex, nonlinear patterns in financial time series. The forecasting is conducted using daily datafromtheS&P500index, coveringtheperiodfromJanuary1, 1998, toDecember 31, 2024. A rolling window approach is employed to train the model and generate one-step-ahead volatility forecasts. The performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model is evaluated through both statistical testing and investment simulations. Results show that the hybrid approach ou...

> employed in this thesis involves a combination of stochastic volatility modeling, LSTM networks and statistical testing. The SV model is used to generate volatility forecasts, which are then incorporated as inputs to the LSTM model. Additionally, benchmarks, including standalone LSTM and SV models, are introduced to compare the performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Diebold-Mariano Tests are used to statistically evaluate the significance of the differences in predictive performance between the models. This study contributes to financial modeling by examining the combination of a statistical SV model as input to a machine learning LSTM model. It is the first to investigate the impact of incorporating SV predictions of latent volatility into the LSTM architecture. This hybrid approach captures both latent stochastic processes and nonlinear dependencies in financial time series, improving the model’s ability to reflect unpredictable market dynamics. The step-by-step framework, supported by sensitivity analysis and statistical testing, bridges the gap between deep learning techniques and traditional econometric approaches. Practically, the study demonstrates relevance through a simulated investment 2 strategy, highlighting potential improvements in portfolio risk management, dynamic asset allocation, and algorithmic trading, and offering tools for more adaptive and resilient investment strategies in volatile markets.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> s are drawn from the hypothesis testing conducted in this study: •H1: The results show that the inclusion of stochastic volatility forecasts for day t+1 enhances the predictive accuracy of the LSTM model. •H2: Augmenting the input data of the LSTM model with external information beyond historical returns was proven to improve its forecasting performance. •H3: The comparative metrics analysis showed that the hybrid SV-LSTM model delivers enhanced volatility forecasts compared to the standalone SV model. In addition to the main hypotheses, the following secondary research questions underwent investigation: •RQ1 Increasing the dimensionality of inputs from the SV model further enhances the predictive performance of the hybrid model. •RQ2 The change of data preprocessing scaling from min-max to either standard or robust scaling improved the performance of the SV-LSTM model. •RQ3 The decreased sequence of the input data into the LSTM model was shown to not leverage the SV-LSTM prediction accuracy. This study made a contribution to financial modelling by introducing and evaluating the combination of a statistical SV model as an input into a machine learning LSTM model. This approach allows the model to capture unpredictable market dynamics by incorporating the latent stochastic process and nonlinear dependencies in financial time series. The simulation of investment strategy alongside the sensitivity analysis provided practical insights into the application of the presented model. The hybrid SV-ML framework could be expanded in a number of ways in future studies. One approach involves feeding machine learning models with different outputs from the stochastic volatility model, such as latent states or predictive densities. Directly incorporating machine learning into the SV estimation procedure is another promising approach that could lessen the need for large-scale sampling by substituting effective approximators for computationally demanding simulations. Adaptability may also be 30 improved by further research into more complex hybrid structures, such as fusing LSTM with more specialized SV models. Model stability may be increased by standardizing ML hyperparameters across windows.

This paper presents a rigorous post-mortem analysis of "Galaxy Empire," a hybrid framework coupling LSTM/Transformer-based perception with a genetic "Time-is-Life" survival mechanism. Deploying a population of 500 autonomous agents in a high-frequency cryptocurrency environment, we observed a catastrophic divergence between training metrics (Validation APY >300% ) and live performance (Capital Decay >70% ). We deconstruct this failure through a multi-disciplinary lens, identifying three critical failure modes: the overfitting ofAleatoric Uncertaintyin low-entropy time-series, theSurvivor Biasinherent in evolutionary selection under high variance, and the mathematical impossibility of overcoming microstructure friction without order-flow data.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> and Implications We successfully engineered a system that integrated the cutting edge of Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation, and Agent-Based Modeling. The "Galaxy Empire" was designed to be the ultimate trading organism: perceiving via Transformers, adapting via Evolution, and surviving via Diversity Preservation. Its economic failure serves as a potent empirical validation of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) at high frequencies for OHLCV data [20]. The primary contribution of this work is the demystification of complexity. We demonstrated thatModel Complexity cannot compensate for Information Deficiency. The "Red Queen" runs fast, but on a treadmill of transaction fees and random walk noise, she moves backward. 5.1 Implications for Retail Investors The failure of such a sophisticated system offers profound and sobering lessons for the individual investor: 1. The Frequency Trap:If an autonomous system with zero latency and deep learning capabilities cannot overcome the 0.1% friction cost of high-frequency trading, a manual trader attempting to "scalp" on 5-minute or 15-minute charts is statistically guaranteed to lose capital over the long term. The math of friction is unforgiving. 5 APREPRINT- DECEMBER19, 2025 2. The Leverage Illusion:Our experiment showed that high leverage ( 5x+) does not increase the probability of success; it only accelerates the "Time to Ruin." The liquidation cascade observed in our simulation proves that leverage turns a fair game into a distinct disadvantage due to volatility decay [21]. 3. Complexity ̸= Profitability:Retail investors often believe they lose because they lack complex tools. Our results suggest the opposite: we lostbecauseof complexity. Simple, low-frequency strategies (e.g., Dollar Cost Averaging or Spot Holding) that minimize interaction with market friction often outperform complex high-frequency active management. Future research must pivot away from "predicting price direction" on micro-timeframes. True Alpha lies not in being faster than the market, but in operating on timeframes (Daily/Weekly) or data sources (On-Chain, Order Flow) where the signal-to-noise ratio is structurally higher [22].

> We consider a Kyle-type model where insider trading takes place among a potentially large population of liquidity traders and is subject to legal penalties. Insiders exploit the liquidity provided by the trading masses to “camouflage” their actions and balance expected wealth with the necessary stealth to avoid detection. Under a diverse spectrum of prosecution schemes, we establish the existence of equilibria for arbitrary population sizes and a unique limiting equilibrium. A convergence analysis determines the scale of insider trading by a stealth indexγ, revealing that the equilibrium can be closely approximated by a simple limit due to diminished price informativeness. Empirical aspects are derived from two calibration experiments using non-overlapping data sets spanning from 1980 to 2018, which underline the indispensable role of a large population in insider trading models with legal risk, along with important implications for the incidence of stealth trading and the deterrent ef...

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized financial markets by enabling complex assetexchange protocols without trusted intermediaries. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a central component of DeFi, providing the core functionality of swapping assets of different types at algorithmically computed exchange rates. Several mainstream AMM implementations are based on the constant-product model, which ensures that swaps preserve the product of the token reserves in the AMM — up to atrading feeused to incentivize liquidity provision. Trading fees substantially complicate the economic properties of AMMs, and for this reason some AMM models abstract them away in order to simplify the analysis. However, trading fees have a non-trivial impact on users’ trading strategies, making it crucial to develop refined AMM models that precisely account for their effects. In this work, we extend a foundational model of AMMs by introducing a new parameter, the trading feeϕ∈(0, 1], into the swap rate f...

Uniswap v2 [3] and other mainstream AMM implementations [1, 2] use theconstant-product swap ratefunction: SXϕ(x,r 0,r 1) = ϕr1 r0 +ϕx whereϕ∈(0,1](1) where r0 and r1 are, respectively, the reserves of the tokensτ0 and τ1 in the current AMM state, and the parameterϕis thetrading fee. Despite the name “constant-product”, swaps preserve the productr0·r1 of the AMM reserves only in the fee-less case, i.e. whenϕ= 1. Instead, whenϕ<1, the product of the reserves strictly increases upon each swap. More specifically, if an AMM{r0 :τ0,r 1 :τ1}evolves into{r0 +x:τ0,r 1−y:τ1}upon a swap, then(r0 +x)(r1−y)>r 0r1. Therefore, the amounty of tokensτ1 sent to the user performing the swap is reduced compared to the fee-less case.1 The intuition is that when the transaction A:swap(x,τ0,τ1) is fired, the actual number of tokens that are used to re-balance the AMM pair is notx, butϕ·xinstead. This means that A receives fewer tokens and some units of τ1 token are “kept” by the AMM in order to benefit its liquidity providers (LPs). The incentives to LPs are briefly discussed at the end of this section. ▶ Example 1.Consider a systemΓcontaining an AMM {40 :τ0,60 :τ1}and user A’s wallet holding30 : τ0 and20 : τ1. We write such state asΓ =A[30 :τ0,20 :τ1]|{40 :τ0,60 :τ1}. Suppose that A wants to swap10 :τ0, and that the trading fee in(1) is set toϕ= 0.997.

KeywordsSystematicMacro ·PortfolioManagement ·DeepLearning ·Attention ·GraphNeuralNetworks ·Transaction Costs·Robust Optimization·Risk Measures 1 Introduction The central goal of systematic portfolio management is to construct asset allocations that generalize out-of-sample under heavy-tailed returns, regime shifts, and significant trading frictions. While classical mean–variance optimization [Markowitz, 1952] provides a foundational framework, its practical deployment is plagued by “error maximization” [Michaud, 1989], where small estimation errors in covariance matrices lead to unstable, turnover-intensive portfolios. Consequently, modern approaches have increasingly pivoted toward machine learning pipelines. However, most existing methods adopt a disjoint two-stage approach – forecasting returns first, then performing a portfolio construction step – arXiv:2601.05975v1 [q-fin.TR] 9 Jan 2026 DeePM: Regime-Robust Deep Learning for Systematic Macro Portfolio Management which misaligns the training loss...

The system constructs four types of analytical agents—announcement, event, price momentum, and market—each conducting analysis from different dimensions; then the prediction agent integrates these multi-source signals to output directional probability distributions across multiple time horizons; then the decision agent generates discrete position adjustment signals based on the prediction results and risk control constraints, thereby forming a closed loop of ”analysis–prediction–decision–execution.” This study further compares two prediction model pathways: for the prediction agent, directly calling the general-purpose large model DeepSeekR1 versus using a specialized small model Qwen3-8B fine-tuned via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alignment.

Its core goal is to judge: given the current price and volatility state, whether the most recently disclosed set of announcements constitutes trading signals with historical statistical significance. At the data level, a historical impact analysis module is established for specific types of announcements. When this module is invoked, it extracts historical announcements of the same type for that REIT before the analysis date from the database, including announcement summaries, sentiment annotations, and price performance within specific trading days after the announcement release. These historical records are grouped by ”positive / neutral / negative” sentiment, and multiple statistics are calculated accordingly, such as short-term probability of price increase, average increase ratios over different windows, and frequency of significant fluctuations under positive or negative scenarios, thereby forming a historical price reaction profile for that announcement type. 5 In the real-time phase, the system collects all announcements released within the 7 natural days preceding the analysis date and fil...

• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> is consistent with earlier empirical findings showing that order-book imbalances have limited, unstable, and highly conditional predictive power for short-horizon price changes [4, 6, 9]. The present framework provides a structural explanation for these observations: imbalance is not a dynamical driver but an internal deformation mode of the observable liquidity geometry. B. Shear is not the time derivative of price Equally important is what shear isnot. The empirical decoupling between shear amplitude and mid-price translation demonstrates that shear cannot be identified with the time derivative of the mid price, nor with any finite-difference proxy thereof. In the present construction, the mid price is a gaugedependent quantity defined by a global symmetry point of the projected liquidity measure. Translations of the projected coordinate act as gauge transformations that shift the mid without altering the shape of the density. Shear, by contrast, is invariant under such translations and probes the local asymmetry and curvature of the density around the mid. Thetwoobservablesthereforeinhabitcomplementary subspaces of the observable manifold and cannot be related by differentiation or integration in time. This geometric separation clarifies why attempts to model price changes directly from order-book shape often yield unstable or regime-dependent results, as reported for instance in Refs. [10, 13]. From this perspective, such instability is not accidental but structural. C. Directional liquidity as geometric shear Within the present framework, bid–ask asymmetry arises naturally as a directional shear mode of the projected liquidity geometry. Once a mid-price cut is introduced, the restriction of a single projected density to either side yields two complementary branches. Asymmetry between these branches reflects local skewness of the density, not the existence of independent supply and demand forces. Inflationary relational dynamics amplify this effect. Heterogeneous growth and reconfiguration of the underlying relational network continuously reshape the projected density, inducing time-dependent shear without requiring any change in the global position of the projection. This mechanism explains why bid–ask asymmetry is both ubiquitous and highly non-stationary in empirical data. Importantly, this interpretation subsumes a wide range of empirical regularities reported in the literature on order-book shape and dynamics [4, 8

Foundational inventoryand information-based models establish the theoretical link between trading activity and price formation. The seminal model of Kyle [12] shows how an informed insider strategically places trades over time, and how market makers infer information from aggregate order flow to set prices. Complementing this, Glosten and Milgrom [9] model the bid-ask spread as a direct consequence of adverse selection, where liquidity providers widen their quotes to compensate for the risk of trading against privately informed agents. These theories, synthesized empirically by Hasbrouck [11], provide the basis for our features related to order flow and spreads. A more recent, data-driven perspective from econophysics, particularly the work of Bouchaud et al. [3] and Cont et al. [7], documents universal statistical patterns in price impact, such as the ”square-root” law, suggesting that endogenous feedback loops in the trading process itself are as important as fundamentals. This motivates our use of flexible, non-linear models capable of capturing these complex dynamics. Limit order book research has evolved to document rich predictive structures. Early work by Gould et al. [10] provides...

Using generalized eigenvalue problems, we can separate these components, providing insight into parameter drift, mean reversion regimes and/or tail risk stability. The method is computationally tractable and can be applied to diverse asset classes, offering a powerful tool for risk and strategy management. The conceptual framework, moving from small to large structures, mirrors approaches used in physical sciences. The remarkable property of the methods described in this paper is their ability to persist the in-sample time scales of the selected components out of sample.

• **Model / Framework**:
> 4.1 Problem Framing Traditional stat arbitrage clustering approaches, whether sector-based classifications, correlation/cointegration methods or more recent graph-based methods like SPONGEsym, are fundamentally backward-looking. SPONGEsym specifically – as in Cartea et al.’s (2023) approach -, focuses on historical correlation matrices build from residual returns, which only adapt after the market structure has already shifted. In crisis regimes, such as the COVID-19 shock, these correlations spike rapidly, collapsing clusters into a few dominant groups and generating trading losses. Even extensions like ML-filtered SPONGEsym – where trades are only entered if they are in the highest 10% of predicted probability of being profitable – remain subject to this lag, as their predictive element is applied after the cluster formation step, not before. This creates a clear research gap: the application of modern machine learning architectures to predict future correlations, enabling clustering to be performed on forward-looking relationships rather than historical relationships. By conditioning trades on predicted rather than lagged correlation structures, such models adapt more rapidly to crisis regimes minimizing losses and capture additional gains in stable periods, as trades are based on the anticipated market state rather than one that has already evolved. We target 10-day-ahead correlations among S&P 500 constituents, aligned with the 10-day rebalance period in the strategy pu...

> —In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance—driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity—remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra “History Is Not Enough” underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning–based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner–scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framewo...

The framework integrates a parameterized data manipulation module with a learning-guided planner–scheduler, forming a feedback loop that dynamically regulates manipulation strength and proportion of data to be manipulated as the model evolves. This design allows the data pipeline to self-adjust to distributional drift, ensuring consistent data quality and realistic synthesis throughout the learning process. Experiments on forecasting and trading tasks demonstrate that the system improves robustness and generalization across models and markets.

> A quantitative understanding of the stochastic dynamics in limit order price changes is essential for meaningful advances in market microstructure research and effective execution strategy design. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical analysis of intraday limit order price change transition dynamics, treating ask and bid orders separately across different market capitalization tiers. Using high-frequency tick data from NASDAQ100 stocks, we employ a discrete-time Markov chain framework to analyze the evolution of price adjustments throughout the trading day. We categorize consecutive price changes into nine distinct states and estimate transition probability matrices (TPMs) for six intraday intervals across High (HMC), Medium (MMC), and Low (LMC) market capitalization stocks. Elememt-wise comparison of TPMs reveals systematic intraday patterns: price inertia i.e. self-transition probability, peaks during opening and closing hours, stabilizing at lower levels during midda...

> [28, 29], we develop a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) framework to analyze limit order price change transitions using high-frequency tickby-tick data for NASDAQ100 stocks. Consecutive limit order price changes are classified into nine discrete states based on their magnitude and direction, yielding categorical time series that capture the sequential nature of pricing decisions. For each intraday intervalτ∈ {T 1,T 2, . . . ,T6} and market capitalization tierc∈ {HMC,MMC,LMC}, we estimate transition probability matricesP (τ,c) i j describing the likelihood of transitioning from stateito statej. Treating bid and ask limit orders separately allows us to explicitly account for directional asymmetries in price revision behavior. Employing this DTMC framework, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of transition probabilities, stationary distributions, and key Markov chain metrics, including spectral gap, entropy rate, and mean recurrence time. We further investigate cross-interval similarities using clustering techniques and Jensen–Shannon divergence. Our...

• **Abstract Reference**:
> In this work, we investigate the market-making problem on a trading session in which a continuous phase on a limit order book is followed by a closing auction. Whereas standard optimal market-making models typically rely on terminal inventory penalties to manage end-of-day risk, ignoring the significant liquidity events available in closing auctions, we propose a Deep Q-Learning framework that explicitly incorporates this mechanism. We introduce a market-making framework designed to explicitly anticipate the closing auction, continuously refining the projected clearing price as the trading session evolves. We develop a generative stochastic market model to simulate the trading session and to emulate the market. Our theoretical model and Deep Q-Learning method is applied on the generator in two settings: (1) when the mid price follows a rough Heston model with generative data from this stochastic model; and (2) when the mid price corresponds to historical data of assets from the S&P 500...

> , contributions and financial insights This work proposes a new market-making model based on a reinforcement learning approach, designed to operate over a typical trading session while explicitly anticipating the closing auction at the end of the session. As far as we know, this paper is the first considering a reinforcement learning method for CLOB optimal market making followed by anticipated closing auciton. The proposed reinforcement learning framework relies on Q-learning, originally introduced in [62], and on its extension to Deep Q-Learning using neural networks for strategy exploration and selection [47, 23]. These approaches have been successfully applied to a wide range of financial problems, including optimal asset allocation, optimal execution in dark pools, and market making; see, for instance, [49, 25, 36, 51, 5]. More specifically, we compare a standard Q-learning approach for market making with closing auction trading to a neural-fitted Q-learning method. The goal of Q-learning is to find the optimal action-value functionQwhich yields the optimal policy. Neural-fitted Q-learning consists in parameterizing the action-value function with a neural networkQθ such that optimization overQbecomes optimization over the weightsθ∈R q, for someq∈N ∗. In the Neural Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQ) algorithm, the neural network is trained by minimizing a squared temporaldifference error over a batch of sampled transitions using gradient descent [56]. Using a deep neural networ...

The model exhibits stability across a broad parameter space, with complex agent behaviors and price interactions producing self-regulatory price discovery. Second, using this simulation framework, we investigate the conditions under which a highly resourced minority, or “whale” agent, with a biased valuation can distort the market price, and for how long.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Prediction markets mobilize financial incentives to forecast binary event outcomes through the aggregation of dispersed beliefs and heterogeneous information. Their growing popularity and demonstrated predictive accuracy in political elections have raised speculation and concern regarding their susceptibility to manipulation and the potential consequences for democratic processes. Using agent-based simulations combined with an analytic characterization of price dynamics, we study how high-budget agents can introduce price distortions in prediction markets. We explore the persistence and stability of these distortions in the presence of herding or stubborn agents, and analyze how agent expertise affects market-price variance.

We provide visual documentation of this validation benchmark in Section 8.4. 2.6. Relevance of the Price Error to Electoral Outcomes In empirical research, prices in prediction markets are commonly interpreted as the probability of a future event [39, 56]. In public settings however, such prices may instead be interpreted using binary decision rules regarding the likely winner, particularly under rapid, headline-level media reporting. Under this interpretation, small deviations around the 0.5 threshold are more likely to flip the implied winner, even when the underlying probabilistic error is small. By treating the market price and true election outcome as normally distributed random variables, we can visualize the probability of misclassification across a range of market and election values Fig. 2 (D). 3. An exploration of market manipulation and volatility The model provides a tool for researchers to evaluate various mechanisms within prediction markets. We provide the first of such an exploration by stress-testing market resilience to price manipulation. In the remainder of this work we explore how high-budget bettors create sustained market price error, and the interaction between such bettors and herding agents. 3.1. Simulation Study 3.1.1.

Optimal market making with execution has previously been addressed within the Almgren-Chriss market impact model, which includes instantaneous and permanent components. However, there is overwhelming empirical evidence of the transient nature of market impact, with instantaneous and permanent impacts arising as the two limiting cases.

We introducePredictionMarketBench, a SWEbench-style benchmark for evaluating algorithmic and LLM-based trading agents on prediction markets via deterministic, event-driven replay of historical limit-order-book and trade data. PredictionMarketBench standardizes (i) episode construction from raw exchange streams (orderbooks, trades, lifecycle, settlement), (ii) an execution-realistic simulator with maker/taker semantics and fee modeling, and (iii) a tool-based agent interface that supports both classical strategies and tool-calling LLM agents with reproducible trajectories.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> 8.1 Limitations PredictionMarketBench is an initial step toward standardized, execution-aware evaluation for predictionmarket trading agents, and it has several limitations. First, the current release is small (4 episodes from January 2026) and spans a limited set of event types; broader statistical claims require more diverse markets and time periods. Second, while maker/taker execution and fees are modeled, the simulator is still an abstraction of live trading: latency, exchange-specific priority rules, and strategic interaction with other agents are not modeled explicitly [16]. Third, our baseline agents are intentionally simple and are not tuned for out-of-sample robustness; repeated iteration on this dataset risks backtest overfitting [2]. 8.2 Conclusion We presented PredictionMarketBench, a SWE-bench-style benchmark for backtesting algorithmic and LLM-based trading agents on prediction markets using deterministic replay of real orderbooks, trades, and settlement outcomes. Our initial results illustrate the importance of execution realism and transaction costs: an active LLM agent can incur large settlement losses, while a fee-aware algorithmic alpha (Bollinger Bands) can remain profitable in volatile episodes. We release the benchmark to support reproducible comparisons and encourage future work on expanding the dataset, adding stronger baselines, and studying robust agent design under realistic execution constraints. A LLM system prompt You are a trading agent operating on Kalshi prediction markets. 8 ## Objective Maximize profit by trading binary event contracts. Each contract pays $1.00 (100 cents) if the event outcome matches (YES wins = $1 for YES holders, NO wins = $1 for NO holders). ## Market Mechanics - Prices are quoted in cents (1-99) - A YES contract at 60c means the market implies ~60% probability - A NO contract at the same market would be at ~40c (100 - 60 = 40) - You can BUY or SELL on either YES or NO side ## Fee Structure (Critical for Profitability) - **Taker fee**: 7%×price×(1 - price/100) - applies to market orders and limit orders that cross the spread - **Maker fee**: 1.75%×price×(1 - price/100) - applies to resting limit orders that provide liquidity - Example: At 50c, taker fee = 1.75c per contract, maker fee = 0.44c per contract - Maker orders are 4x cheaper - strongly prefer GTC or POST_ONLY limit orders ## Strategy Guidelines 1. **Edge calculation**: Only trade when expected value > fees.

The market is modeled as an inflationary relational system without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through projection, implemented here via spectral embeddings of the graph Laplacian. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate, while the projected density defines liquidity profiles around the mid price. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis—excluding intrinsic length scales beyond distance to the mid and finite visibility—we show that projected supply and demand are constrained to gamma-like functional forms.

Growth and reorganization proceed through inflationary updates that generate heterogeneous, hub-dominated structures without finetuning. Crucially, none of the standard market observables are defined at this level. Observable quantities arise only through projection. By applying spectral embeddings based on the graph Laplacian, an observer assigns effective coordinates to the relational substrate. A one-dimensional projection induces a scalar coordinate naturally interpreted as price, while the distribution of projected density defines liquidity profiles. Successive projections of an evolving relational system give rise to apparent time series, returns, and fluctuations, even though no fundamental time variable exists microscopically. Within this framework, supply and demand are not independent behavioral curves but geometric branches of a single projected density. We show that, under minimal structural assumptions on ...

Similarly, Cont, Stoikov, and Talreja [17] proposed a queue-reactive framework in which liquidity profiles emerge from the interaction of stochastic order flows at discrete price levels. While these models reproduce many empirical features, they rely on behavioral assumptions, calibration choices, or equilibrium concepts whose universality across assets and market conditions is difficult to establish. In this work, we adopt a complementary perspective. Rather than modeling price formation directly or specify∗ joao@quantumcomp.pt ing microscopic order flow mechanisms, we ask whether familiar order-book observables can emerge generically from the projection of a more primitive relational structure. Our approach is inspired by pregeometric frameworks in statistical physics, where geometry and dynamics are not assumed at the microscopic level but arise only through observation and coarse-graining. We model the market as an inflationary relational network whose fundamental description contains no metric, temporal ordering, or economic coordinates.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student’s t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformerbased probabilistic framework,ProbFM(probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition.

Specifically, ProbFM provides a straightforward application of Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to single-variate single-step time series forecasting with six key components: (1) input processing with adaptive patching and positional encoding, (2) standard transformer architecture for representation learning, (3) DER head for principled uncertainty estimation and epistemic-aleatoric decomposition, (4) combined loss functions including evidential and coverage losses, (5) single-stage training with AdamW optimization (Loshchilov and Hutter 2017) and evidence annealing for simplicity and efficiency, and (6) single-pass inference providing point predictions, uncertainty decomposition, and confidence intervals. In this section, we begin by formally defining the problem and establishing the theoretical underpinnings of our method. Subsequently, we introduce the design of the ProbFM architecture, which firstly encompasses input encoding and patch-based processing, a transformer backbone, and a Deep Evidential Regression head. Furthermore, we propose an improved loss function that incorporates coverage mechanisms.

Real-world implementation would require incorporating these factors. •Alternative Architectures: We focus on LSTM-based implementations. Other architectures may yield different trade-offs. G Future Work We outline several directions for future research that address current limitations and extend the applicability: •Cross-Domain Generalization:We plan to extend evaluation beyond cryptocurrency markets to validate generalizability across diversified domains. This includes financial markets (equities, foreign exchange, commodities) as well as non-financial time series applications such as energy demand forecasting, traffic prediction, and industrial sensor data. Such comprehensive evaluation will establish whether the epistemic-aleatoric decomposition benefits transfer across domains with fundamentally different noise characteristics and temporal dynamics. •Component-Level Ablation Studies:To better understand the contribution of individual architectural components, we will conduct systematic ablation studies that isolate the effects of: (i) coverage loss integration, (ii) evidence annealing schedule, and (iii) bounded prediction transform. These ablations will provide clearer guidance on which design choices are essential for different application contexts. •Statistical Robustness Analysis:Future work will incorporate multiple random initializations per configuration with comprehensive statistical analysis including confidence intervals, standard deviations across runs, and formal hypothesis testing to quantify significance of performance differences. This is particularly important given the inherent noise in financial time series data. •Classical Baseline Comparisons:To establish absolute performance benchmarks, we will include comparisons against classical time series and financial econometric models, including ARIMA, GARCH, and their variants. These baselines will provide context for understanding the value-add of deep learning approaches and help identify regimes where simpler models may suffice. •Multi-Horizon and Multivariate Extensions:We plan to extend the framework to multi-horizon and multi

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Copy trading has become the dominant entry strategy in meme coin markets. However, due to the market’s extreme illiquid and volatile nature, the strategy exposes an exploitable attack surface: adversaries deploy manipulative bots to front-run trades, conceal positions, and fabricate sentiment, systematically extracting value from naïve copiers at scale. Despite its prevalence, bot-driven manipulation remains largely unexplored, and no robust defensive framework exists.

### 🎯 研究背景與目標 (Context & Objectives)
• **Research Gap & Purpose (Extracted)**：
> In this paper, we study the difference between confirmation intervals: under Ethereum’s default configuration, DEX transactions can be executed every 12 seconds at slot boundaries, while under faster execution regimes, transactions can be executed every second within subslots. Historical DEX prices are readily available and can be used for 12-second slot benchmark simulations. For a faster regime, we need a framework to interpolate these prices for 1-second subslots. Our framework includes three components. First, we start with a historical price for a current slot. It is also a price for the initial subslot. Next, we derive a pricep DEX(ti) of thei-th subslot from a pricep DEX(ti−1) of the (i−1)-th subslot. To do this, we apply (1) arbitrage transactions from the previous slot if present,...

• **Abstract Reference**:
> This paper examines the impact of reducing Ethereum slot time on decentralized exchange activity, with a focus on CEX-DEX arbitrage behavior. We develop a trading model where the agent’s DEX transaction is not guaranteed to land, and the agent explicitly accounts for this execution risk when deciding whether to pursue arbitrage opportunities. We compare agent behavior under Ethereum’s default 12-second slot time environment with a faster regime that offers 1-second subslot execution. The simulations, calibrated to Binance and Uniswap v3 data from July to September 2025, show that faster slot times increase arbitrage transaction count by 535% and trading volume by 203% on average. The increase in CEX-DEX arbitrage activity under 1-second subslots is driven by the reduction in variance of both successful and failed trade outcomes, increasing the risk-adjusted returns and making CEX-DEX arbitrage more appealing.

> This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatialnetwork space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor—a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A L´ evy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> High-Frequency trading (HFT) environments are characterised by large volumes of limit order book (LOB) data, which is notoriously noisy and non-linear. Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon ( k) increases.

• **Model / Framework**:
> 3.1 Data framework and Supervised Learning Setup The empirical validity of this study is based on theFI-2010 Benchmark Dataset[ 4], which provides a standardized high-frequency environment when evaluating LOB models. Although the raw 144-dimensional features come with Z-score normalization, transitioning from discrete LOB snapshots to a format for deep learning relies on specific temporal framing. 3.1.1 The Sliding Window Unit Adopting the standard supervised learning protocols from limit order books [ 7], we use aSliding Window Unit. Given the sequence of normalized states ˆL∞, . . . , ˆ NL, we construct an input sample Xt ∈R T×144 where T= 10 represents the look-back horizon. This makes sure that the model captures the "order flow momentum" and liquidity path-dependency rather than just a static view book. 3.2 Architectural Specification Our implementation explores whether the marginal utility of spline-based functional activations is greater than that of traditional linear weights. 3.2.1 DeepLOB Baseline(CNN-LSTM) The DeepLOB architecture [8] serves as our spatial-temporal baseline. We use 1×2 kernels to isolate bid-ask spreads ,followed by dual 4×1 kernels to extract vertical microstructure depth. The output is permuted so that the feature maps correspond to the temporal axis before being processed by a 64-unit LSTM. 3 3.2.2 Proposed T-KAN Configuration The T-KAN architecture uses a dual-layer LSTM encoder (64 hidden units) to capture high-frequency dependencies.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> The results of the experiment validate the hypothesis that using Kolmogorov-Arnolod layers [6] rather than standard linear transformations enhance the extraction of alpha from high-frequency LOB data. By moving beyond the static activation functions of the DeepLOB baseline, the T-KAN architecture shows a superior ability to map the non-linear dynamics of market market structures. 5.1 Economic Viability and the Profitability-Capacity Trade-off The best evidence to support the T-KAN architecture is seen in the transaction-cost adjusted backtest. While the T-KAN model used a higher parameter count (104,451) as opposed to the DeepLOB baseline (58,211), this higher capacity directly translated into economic viability. Under a 1.0 bps transaction cost regime, the DeepLOB baseline was unable to overcome execution friction, causing a terminal return of-82.76 %. This was much unlike the T-KAN, which achieved a terminal return of132.48%. This suggests that T-KAN does not only achieve a higher statistical accuracy, but specifically identifies high-conviction liquidity imbalances that stay profitable even after accounting for market fees. This "profitability density" justifies that 79.4% increase in parameter count, as though the model successfully transitioned from theoretical predictor to a viable trading strategy. 6 5.2 Robustness to Alpha Decay A big problem faced in high-frequency trading is alpha decay: the rapid decay of information. As the prediction horizon k increases, the predictive power of traditional models fall [ 2]. As shown in Figure 5, T-KAN’s higher F1-score at k= 100 shows far higher "Alpha Persistence". Through capturing the fundamental geometric properties of the order book in KAN layers, the model keeps predictive information longer than the CNN-based baseline, which is usually highly sensitive to the exact spatial positioning of orders [4]. Figure 5: Alpha Decay Comparison: Information Coefficient (IC) vs. Forecast Horizon (k). T-KAN maintains higher predictive persistence over longer horizons compared to DeepLOB. 5.3 Industry Outlook: Interpretability and FPGA Implementation From an industry perspective T-KAN presents two main advantages. Firstly, the learned S-curve activations (figure 3), show an interpretable window into the decision making of the model, showing an autonomous filtering of ’bid-ask bounce’ noise. Secondly, the T-KAN architecture is uniquely suited for ultra-low latency hardware acceleration. Quite unlike the dense matrix mu

Building on the framework of [15], we extend spike prediction from a single zone to a multi-zone setting and treat both positive and negative DART spikes within a unified statistical model. To translate directional signals into economically meaningful positions, we develop a structural and market-consistent price impact model based on day-ahead bid stacks. This yields closed-form expressions for the optimal vector of zonal INC/DEC quantities, capturing asymmetric buy/sell impacts and cross-zone congestion effects. When applied to NYISO, the resulting impact-aware strategy significantly improves the risk–return profile relative to unit-size trading and highlights substantial heterogeneity across markets and seasons. 1...

Finally, we solve a quadratic optimization problem that jointly determines the optimal vector of zonal virtual positions, explicitly accounting for asymmetric system-wide and local market impact (Section 4.2). This separation between signal generation and impact-aware sizing allows predictive accuracy and economic consistency to be evaluated independently. Overall, our...

This paper treats forecasting as an econometric input to a constrained decision problem. A predictive distribution induces a decision rule through a utility objective combined with an explicit friction operator consisting of both a cost functional and a feasible-set constraint system. The econometric target becomes minimisation of expected decision loss net of costs rather than minimisation of prediction error. The paper develops a utility-weighted calibration criterion aligned to the decision loss and establishes sufficient conditions under which calibrated predictive distributions weakly dominate uncalibrated alternatives.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Cryptocurrency trading increasingly depends on timely integration of heterogeneous web information and market microstructure signals to support short-horizon decision making under extreme volatility. However, existing trading systems struggle to jointly reason over noisy multi-source web evidence while maintaining robustness to rapid price shocks at subsecond timescales. The first challenge lies in synthesizing unstructured web content, social sentiment, and structured OHLCV signals into coherent and interpretable trading decisions without amplifying spurious correlations, while the second challenge concerns risk control, as slow deliberative reasoning pipelines are ill-suited for handling abrupt market shocks that require immediate defensive responses. To address these challenges, we propose WEBCRYPTOAGENT, an agentic trading framework that decomposes web-informed decision making into modality-specific agents and consolidates their outputs into a unified evidence document for confiden...

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> We presented WebCryptoAgent, a reflective agentic trading framework that integrates web-informed reasoning, contextual experience replay, and regime-aware risk control for short-horizon cryptocurrency trading. By decoupling strategic LLMbased reasoning from low-latency tactical protection, the proposed two-tier architecture enables robust decision making under extreme market volatility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebCryptoAgent improves trading stability, reduces spurious activity, and achieves stronger riskadjusted performance compared to existing baselines. Beyond cryptocurrency markets, this work highlights the potential of reflective, memoryaugmented agents for high-frequency decisionmaking tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments. Limitation and Future Work While WebCryptoAgent demonstrates encouraging performance, several limitations remain. The framework currently relies on proprietary large language models for strategic reasoning, which may affect reproducibility across deployments. In addition, although the contextual reflection mechanism supports online adaptation without retraining, the replay buffer is updated using simple heuristics, and its long-term behavior warrants further study. Future work may explore alternative model choices, more principled reflection updates, and broader evaluation settings. We also expect that the two-tier reflective architecture could be applicable beyond cryptocurrency trading, though such extensions are left for future investigation.

> —USDC and USDT are the dominant stablecoins pegged to $1 with a total market capitalization of over $300B and rising. Stablecoins make dollar value globally accessible with secure transfer and settlement. Yet in practice, these stablecoins experience periods of stress and de-pegging from their $1 target, posing significant systemic risks. The behavior of market participants during these stress events and the collective actions that either restore or break the peg are not well understood. This paper addresses the question:who restores the peg?We develop a dynamic, agent-based mean-field game framework for fiat-collateralized stablecoins, in which a large population of arbitrageurs and retail traders strategically interacts across explicit primary (mint/redeem) and secondary (exchange) markets during a de-peg episode.

Different components ofµ t enter different parts of the agent cost functions:m t drives inventory and pricing costs,L t andψ t determine primary access costs, andϕ t enters the secondary-market congestion term. The net order flow, in turn, determines market-wide variables like price slippage and execution costs. B. Economic Environment and Agent Types Our model consists of two main components: a multipopulation agent system and a multi-venue market microstructure. The market is populated by a continuum of agents, divided into two classes – (1) Retail Traders: A fractionπ R of the population, characterized by higher execution frictions such as slippage costsκ R and inventory aversionη R. They are assumed to trade exclusively in secondary markets. Their state is their inventoryq R,t and their control variable is their vector of secondary market flowsa R,t ∈R S.

• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> S ANDFUTUREWORK We develop a dynamic Mean-Field Game framework for fiat-collateralized stablecoins, linking market microstructure, agent incentives, and peg dynamics within a single equilibrium model. Calibrations to three major episodes reproduce key features of observed price paths and half-lives, and allow us to isolate which channel restores the peg under different shocks – directly addressing the central question of“who restores the peg?”in practice. When primary redemption rails remain open, recovery is dominated by direct redemptions. When primary capacity is impaired but not broken, recovery reflects a joint contribution from primary arbitrage and secondary buying. When venue-level infrastructure failures both obstruct redemptions and fragment liquidity, both channels contribute little, and recovery is slow. A central structural result is a non-linear threshold in primary-market friction. De-peg half-life remains short when primary execution costs stay within a functional range, but rises sharply once primary access becomes sufficiently expensive, beyond which even favorable secondary-market liquidity cannot restore rapid re-pegs. This converts the model into an operational design and risk-management criterion: peg robustness depends not only on reserve quality, but also on the accessibility, speed, fees, and operational resilience of mint and redeem rails, while secondary-market liquidity primarily acts as a complement that limits propagation of localized outages. An oversimplification is that we work with two representative populations (retail and arbitrageurs) in a tractable LQ equilibrium setting. This abstraction simplifies heterogeneity among liquidity providers and can understate non-linear behavior under extreme stress, including binding constraints and discontinuous primary-rail access. It also treats volatility and liquidity as regime inputs and calibrates primarily to price paths and half-lives, rather than jointly matching flows and order book dynamics. Building on this, future work will incorporate additional agent types and venue-specific constraints, move beyond the LQ specification using learning-based MFG solvers with richer risk objectives and occasionally binding constraints, endogenize liquidity and volatility feedback within the mean field, and validate the model by jointly fitting onchain flows with high-frequency order book data.

> For the current wise investment, investors want to predict the future transaction price or ups and downs directly. The fatal assumption is that the training data set is consistent with the data distribution that has not occurred in the future. However, the natural world will not let us know whether the subsequent data distribution will change. Because of this, even if researchers add a moving window to the training process, it is inevitable that ”machine learning obstacles-prediction delay” will occur. Just search for ”machine learning predict stock price,” and researchers can ﬁnd articles full of pits, all of which have this shortcoming. Therefore, our ﬁrst contribution is not to make future predictions but to focus on the current ”candlesticks pattern detection,” such as Engulﬁng Pattern, Morning Star,. . . . However, the ”candlesticks pattern” is usually a sensational description. It cannot become a stylized trading strategy if investors cannot write a program to enumerate all the characteristics. Even if a trader has a sense of the market 11 Financial Vision Based Reinforcement Learning Trading Strategy A PREPRINT and knows which patterns have to enter and exit, he cannot keep his eyes on all the investment targets. Moreover, our second contribution focuses on detecting trading entry and exit signals combined with related investment strategies.

Compared to the top ten most popular ETFs, the experimental results demonstrate superior performance.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> and Future Work 5.1 Summary of Achievements In this paper, a new approach called XGB-Chiarella is proposed to generate realistic intra-day artiﬁcial ﬁnancial price data in order to provide insight into the intra-day price formation process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst extension of the Chiarella model to generate minute-level intra-day ﬁnancial market simulation. The approach utilises agent-based modelling techniques. The underlying simulation model has only three agents: one for fundamental trader, one for momentum trader, and one for noise trader. The model is simulated and model parameters are calibrated by an XGBoost machine learning surrogate. The proposed methodology is tested on 75 stocks from three exchanges: NASDAQ, LSEG, and HKEX. In terms of stylised facts distance, the proposed XGB-Chiarella method is able to generate more realistic ﬁnancial market simulations than the original Expectation-Maximisation estimation algorithm. This is true in nearly all the stocks from three exchanges. Despite the fact that the methodology is based on a model with only three agents, the XGB-Chiarella methodology successfully generates very realistic ﬁnancial market simulations. This indicates that one agent per category seems to be sufﬁcient to capture the intra-day price formation process for the time scale (minutes) chosen in this paper. The very simple model structure not only accelerates the simulation process in terms of computational cost, but also enable us to scrutinize the intra-day price formation process, such as the trend and value effects. The results provide support for the existence of a universal intra-day price formation mechanism. The realistic simulated intra-day ﬁnancial market indicates that trend and value effects, as well as noise trading, are indispensable to the intra-day price formation process. We also show that in the process of calibration, the XGBoost surrogate model is an accurate approximation of the true model. At the predicted optimal point for each stock on each trading day, the surrogate model prediction error is mostly smaller than 10%. The machine learning surrogate is capable of intelligently directing the exploration of model parameter space. The exploitation-exploration mechanism is also introduced in the model calibration process. A practical application of the proposed methodology is also presented. 17 AUGUST 31, 2022 5.2 Future Work This work can be extended in several aspects. Firstly, in modern ﬁnanc

• **Abstract Reference**:
> .In real-world stock markets, certain chart patterns—such as price declines near historical highs—cannot be fully explained by fundamentals alone. These phenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where investor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but also by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has drawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies. One plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to individual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with personal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in traditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose the Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models (LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions.

• **Model / Framework**:
> A. Problem Formulation We formulate the sector rotation problem as a sequential decision-making task in which an agent selects an allocation across multiple industry sectors to maximize long-term investment return. At each discrete time stept, the agent observes a financial state vectors t, derived from engineered features of sector-level market data. Based on this state, the agent chooses an actiona t, representing the target portfolio allocation across sectors. After executing the action, the environment transitions to a new states t+1 and returns a scalar rewardr t based on the investment outcome. The goal is to learn a policyπ(a t|st) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward E[P t γtrt]. B. Framework Overview We adopt a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. PPO is a widely used policy-gradient method known for its sample efficiency and training stability. It optimizes a clipped surrogate objective to prevent large policy updates and incorporates entropy regularization to encourage exploration. Our framework supports interchangeable policy and value network backbones, allowing both classical and quantum-enhanced models to be evaluated under consistent training protocols. C.

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> A. Reward-Performance Misalignment One of the most significant findings in this study is the observed disconnect between final training rewards and realworld investment performance. Quantum-enhanced models, particularly QNN and QASA, achieved the highest cumulative rewards during training. However, these models underperformed classical architectures in backtested metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This gap arises from a fundamental issue in financial reinforcement learning: the use ofproxy rewardsthat do not fully capture the true objectives of investment performance. In our environment, the agent is rewarded based on whether its selected sector appears in the top-Nranked sectors by future capital share. While this proxy is useful for encouraging short-term predictive accuracy, it fails to directly incentivize risk-adjusted returns, low volatility, or drawdown minimization. As a result, quantum models may learn highly specialized strategies that maximize the proxy reward due to their expressive capacity and susceptibility to overfitting but fail to generalize to broader investment objectives. Classical models, on the other hand, appear to implicitly regularize toward smoother, more stable allocation policies, which align better with investor goals. B. Broader Implications The reward-performance gap we observed is not limited to quantum models, it is a known challenge in deep reinforcement learning for finance. However, the fact that quantum models magnify this gap highlights the urgent need to rethink how reward functions and optimization landscapes interact under quantum regimes. Future research should explore whether quantum models can not only match but exceed classical performance in scenarios where the reward signal better reflects long-term investment goals.

This simulator creates reactive order flow and allows us to decompose slippage into its constituent components: market impact and execution risk. We assess the RL agent’s performance using the efficient frontier based on work by Almgren and Chriss, measuring its ability to balance risk and cost. Results show that the RL-derived strategies consistently outperform baselines and operate near the efficient frontier, demonstrating a strong ability to optimise for risk and impact. These findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning as a powerful tool in the trade...

> In this section, we outline the details of our agent-based market simulator and our RL trading agent. We explain how we employ RL to optimise an execution algorithm using a realistic market simulator. Finally, we generate the Almgren-Chriss efficient frontier using our market simulator to explore the efficiency of the RL devised strategy. 3.1 Market Simulator All tests are run using the Simudyne Market Simulator . It provides a realistic market environment that generates statistically accurate market behaviour. Our market simulator has three main components: theexchange module which matches the protocols and behaviour of a specified exchange, theagentswho have certain behavioural characteristics, and thecalibrationmodule which tunes the parameters of the overall simulator to replicate behaviour of a specific asset on a specific historical date. The simulator recreates the statistical properties of the market using a network of trader agents who are connected to the exchange. At each step, trader agents send messages to submit limit or market orders and amend or delete queued limit orders. The Exchange then sends execution reports back to the Trader as well as level-2 market data. 3.1.1 The Exchange.The exchange determines the protocol by which the limit orders are queued, matched and priced. The exchange’s matching engine will attempt to match each order sequentially. When a sell limit order is less or equal to a buy limit order, a trade occurs and is priced at the e...

> that even with relatively simple loss functions, RL can produce near-optimal execution strategies when appropriately guided by objectives and simulators that reflect market realities. 5 Conclusion In this work, we have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can be effectively applied to the problem of optimal trade execution. Our RL agent, trained in a realistic agent-based simulation, produced execution strategies that outperform traditional baselines such as TWAP and VWAP in terms of slippage and proximity to the efficient frontier. When benchmarked against the Almgren-Chriss efficient frontier, the RL-derived strategies consistently lie close to the frontier. This suggests the agent is capable of learning strategies that efficiently balance risk and impact. The bi-modal unbounded distribution trained under the slippage objective produced the most efficient execution strategy by using its two modes to optimise impact and risk separately. The uni-modal distribution trained with the slippage function produces an execution strategy which can produce optimal VaR at a 95% confidence level. One area for future work is to incorporate a contextual bandit framework. This is where the RL agent learns a policy that maps context to an action to maximise a reward [3, 5]. An agent trained in this manner could update its beliefs during execution, responding to the risk and impact of the execution in real time. Another area which may be interesting to explore is using the efficient frontier as the loss function. The distance to the frontier could be used as the loss function, which would align learning objectives more closely with economic theory [12]. Overall, this study positions RL not just as a viable tool, but as a compelling alternative to traditional algorithmic execution methods in financial markets. We expect extensions, set out above, to further justify the use of RL for optimising market execution, especially where considering correlated market movements and execution across different market regimes. 6 Significance This work demonstrates the potential of RL agents in discovering efficient execution strategies under realistic market conditions. By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment, we show that RL agents can learn policies that balance market impact and risk more effectively than traditional strategies such as TWAP and VWAP. Our approach highlights two key insights. First, RL agents can adaptively learn optimal trade timing by respondi

• **Abstract Reference**:
> —In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance—driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity—remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra “History Is Not Enough” underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning–based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner–scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framewo...

> . We study statistical arbitrage strategies in international crude oil futures markets. We analyse strategies that extend classical pairs trading strategies, considering two benchmark crude oil futures (Brent and WTI) together with the recently introduced Shanghai crude oil futures. We show that the time series of these three futures prices are cointegrated and we introduce a mean-reverting regime-switching process modulated by a hidden Markov chain to model the cointegration spread. By relying on this model and applying online filter-based parameter estimators, we implement and test several statistical arbitrage strategies.

Key to the performance of the LT’s strategies is to balance exchange rate risk and execution costs. In our model, we use the first-order approximation of the curvature of the trading function to compute execution costs.

The majority of AMMs are constant product markets (CPMs) where exchange rates are set by a trading function. This work studies optimal trading and statistical arbitrage in CPMs where balancing exchange rate risk and execution costs is key. Empirical evidence shows that execution costs are accurately estimated by the convexity of the trading function. These convexity costs are linear in the trade size and are nonlinear in the depth of liquidity and in the exchange rate. We develop models for when exchange rates form in a competing centralised exchange, in a CPM, or in both venues. Finally, we derive computationally efficient strategies that account for stochastic convexity costs and we showcase their out-of-sample performance.

• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> AND OUTLOOK The present study has addressed the issue of identifying and quantifying co-dependence among financial instruments, which continues to be a paramount challenge for both researchers and practitioners in the financial industry. While traditional linear measures like the Pearson correlation have maintained their prominence, this paper has introduced a novel framework aimed at analyzing both linear and nonlinear causal relationships within financial markets. To achieve this, we have employed two distinct causal inference methodChaos 13 ologies, namely Transfer Entropy and Convergent CrossMapping, and have utilized Fourier transform surrogates to disentangle their respective linear and nonlinear contributions. Our findings have unveiled that stock indices in Germany and the U.S. exhibit a substantial degree of nonlinear causality, a phenomenon that has largely eluded previous investigations. It is important to recognize that while correlation, exemplified by the Pearson correlation coefficient, serves as an excellent proxy for linear causality, it falls short in capturing the intricate nonlinear dynamics that underlie financial markets. Consequently, relying solely on correlation can lead to an underestimation of causality itself. The framework introduced in this study not only facilitates the quantification of nonlinear causality but also sheds light on the perilous "correlation-causality fallacy." By delving into the nuances of causality, we have motivated how these insights can be harnessed for practical applications, including inferring market signals, implementing pair trading strategies, and enhancing the management of portfolio risk. One of the insights derived from our findings underscores the role that both linear and nonlinear causality can play as early warning indicators for unusual market dynamics. Furthermore, our results suggest that a straightforward incorporation of these causality measures into strategies, such as pair trading and portfolio optimization, can yield better outcomes compared to a reliance solely on Pearson correlation. This understanding can significantly empower traders and risk managers, enabling them to craft more effective trading strategies and to adopt a more proactive approach to risk mitigation. Looking ahead, the implications of our findings extend to various facets of financial research and practice. Further exploration of nonlinear causality may uncover new dimensions of financi

> We present a Monte Carlo approach to pairs trading on mean-reverting spreads modeled by L´ evy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Specifically, we focus on using a variance gamma driving process, an infinite activity pure jump process to allow for more flexible models of the price spread than is available in the classical model. However, this generalization comes at the cost of not having analytic formulas, so we apply Monte Carlo methods to determine optimal trading levels and develop a variance reduction technique using control variates. Within this framework, we numerically examine how the optimal trading strategies are affected by the parameters of the model. In addition, we extend our method to bivariate spreads modeled using a weak variance alpha-gamma driving process, and explore the effect of correlation on these trades.

In this section only, we let X1 ∈ R(p1+1)×m and X2 ∈ R(p2+1)×m be the design matrices, including an intercept. As outlined in Section 4.2, X1 includes the control variates X(ti) − µ, i = 1 , . . . , p, 1A, 1B, and X2 includes the control variates in X1 in addition to ( X(ti) − µ)2, i = 1, . . . , p. Since each simulated sample path of the LDOUP is independent, we have Cov( ϵi) = Σ ϵ,iiI, i = 1, 2 10 and Cov( ϵ1, ϵ2) = Σ ϵ,12I for some 2 × 2 covariance matrix Σ ϵ = (Σ ϵ,ij)2 i,j=1, and where I is the identity matrix. For each of the linear regression models, i = 1, 2, let µC,i be the mean vector of the control variates computed as outlined in Section 4.2, then the predictions xi = (1, µC,i) are bYi = x′ ibβi. As explained in Appendix A, the control variate estimators of E[P ] and E[P 2] are the predictions bY1 and bY2, respectively. Thus, for each argument, the control variate estimator of the value function in (3.2) is bVC := bY1 − γbY2 + γbY 2 1 = b′bY +bY′AbY, where A =  γ 0 0 0  , b =  1 −γ  , bY = bY1 bY2 ! .

Further, we assume the dynamic nature of the factor vector, suggesting a state space framework for the joint modelling of factors and asset returns. Our fair value model is closest in spirit to existing work that presents explanatory models of returns based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [3, 4]. In these papers, the principal components (and their loadings) that are deemed to have sufficiently high explanatory power are an analogue to our model’s factor exposures (and factor vectors). However the papers differ significantly in many key workflow assumptions relative to ours, most importantly with respect to data set construction, asset feature modelling, and the trading strategy assumed. We posit, critically, that the details of each of these steps can have a significant impact on the estimated performance statistics. Hence we clearly describe our methods in the interest of ease of interpretability and reproducibility, and present a range of performance data based on competing sets of reasonable assumptions.

• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> We study multivariate statistical arbitrage under a conditional factor model augmented in a state space framework for US equities trading. Our study shows the modelling approach can yield compelling performance statistics over a 29 year period, an an absolute basis and relative to a reasonable benchmark, and relative to a model estimating returns as a function of factors via ordinary least squares. However, for our experimental set up, we did not find that the non-linear state space model was justified relative to the linear case; though it was no worse, any outperformance benefit does not contrast well with the increased modelling complexity introduced. When we compare our results to existing attempts in the literature, we find that our approach compares well. We also show empirical evidence that blending our investment capital between the long-short strategy and the long-only market portfolio as a function of each strategies estimated mean and variance yields a strategy with improved annual Sharpe ratio, consistent with theory. All results are with respect to reasonable level of transaction costs. There is the scope for academic and practioner work on the strategy presented in this paper, particularly with respect to exploring the potential for improvement on the period of strategy underperformance in recent years. We conclude with some final remarks: • Regarding the data underlying the quantitative strategy, the addition of alternative data beyond factor data and returns time series may improve the predictive power of the model. With respect to the dataset we constructed, and by the recent work of [32], it is the case that estimating submodels over clusters of data – for example, stocks grouped by sector – could lead to significant performance improvement. • The recent work of [24, 33] consider alternative specifications of dynamic factor models for investing, including those with non-linearities at the level of the measurement equation. Such expressions could be handled by our UKF-based framework, and present as a reasonable target for improving performance. • Recall our brief discussion on related literature in Section 2, whereby almost all work cited made use of data on a daily time scale. The literature would be bolstered by analysis completed on alternative time frames, particularly on intraday time scales. This is arguably harder, not the least in terms of data set curation. On the other hand, the recent work of [34] provides evidence of in

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> s In this research paper, we have presented an innovative approach to identifying optimal timing strategies for trading price spreads with mean-reverting properties. Specifically, we formulated a sequential optimal stopping problem that accounts for the timing of both position entry and liquidation, while also incorporating transaction costs. To tackle this challenging problem, we employed the signature optimal stopping method, a powerful tool for determining the optimal entry and exit times that maximize trading returns. Our approach is distinguished by its versatility: it is designed to operate without any assumptions of mean reversion dynamics, making it broadly applicable to a variety of trading scenarios. To validate the efficacy of our methodology, we carried out a comprehensive set of numerical experiments. These experiments served to compare the performance of our approach against conventional mean-reversion 18 trading rules. The results consistently demonstrated the superior performance of our signature-based optimal trading strategy in terms of key metrics such as cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios. In summary, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of quantitative finance by introducing a robust and adaptable method for optimizing trading decisions in mean-reverting markets. Our findings affirm that the signature optimal stopping method offers not only theoretical rigor but also practical utility, presenting a compelling solution to a complex problem in finance. While our focus has been on specific asset pairs and trading conditions, the general principles and techniques introduced here have the potential for broader applications, opening up avenues for future research and practical implementations.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> . This paper is concerned with an optimal strategy for simultaneously trading a pair of stocks. The idea of pairs trading is to monitor their price movements and compare their relative strength over time. A pairs trade is triggered by the divergence of their prices and consists of a pair of positions to short the strong stock and to long the weak one. Such a strategy bets on the reversal of their price strengths. A round-trip trading strategy refers to opening and closing such a pair of security positions. Typical pairs-trading models usually assume a difference of the stock prices satisfies a mean-reversion equation. However, we consider the optimal pairs-trading problem by allowing the stock prices to follow general geometric Brownian motions. The objective is to trade the pairs over time to maximize an overall return with a fixed commission cost for each transaction. Initially, we allow the initial pairs position to be either long or flat. We then consider the problem when the initi...

In pairs trading, a long position is held in one stock while a short position is held in another. The goal is to determine the optimal time to sell the long position and repurchase the short position in order to close the pairs position.

Secondly, we draw parallels between classical portfolio stategies and Sig-Trading strategies and explain how the latter leads to a pathwise extension of the classical setting via the“Signature Efficient Frontier”. Finally, we give explicit examples when trading under an exogenous signal as well as examples for momentum and pair-trading strategies, demonstrated both on synthetic and market data. Our framework combines the best of both worlds between classical theory (whose appeal lies in clear and concise formulae) and between modern, flexible data-driven methods (usually represented by ML approaches) that can handle more realistic datasets. The advantage of the added flexibility of the latter is that one can bypass common issues such as the accumulation of heteroskedastic and asymmetric residuals during the optimisation phase. Overall, Sig-Trading combines the flexibility of data-driven methods without compromising on the clarity of the classical theory and our presented...

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Statistical arbitrage methods identify mispricings in securities with the goal of building portfolios which are weakly correlated with the market. In pairs trading, an arbitrage opportunity is identified by observing relative price movements between a pair of two securities. By simultaneously observing multiple pairs, one can exploit different arbitrage opportunities and increase the performance of such methods. However, the use of a large number of pairs is difficult due to the increased probability of contradictory trade signals among different pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel portfolio construction method based on preference relation graphs, which can reconcile contradictory pairs trading signals across multiple security pairs. The proposed approach enables joint exploitation of arbitrage opportunities among a large number of securities. Experimental results using three decades of historical returns of roughly 500 stocks from the S&P 500 index show that the portfolios based ...

• **Model / Framework**:
> Let a binary relation M : S × S − → {− 1, 0, 1} represent a pairs trading strategy, where S = {s1, s2, . . . , sN } is a set of tradeable securities. 1 When M(s1, s2) = 1 a long position should be entered in the first security s1 and a short position in the second security s2, when M(s1, s2) = −1 a short position should be taken in s1 and long position in s2, and in the case M(s1, s2) = 0 neither s1 nor s2 should be bought or sold. However, due to the stochastic and non-stationary characteristics of the market, M can produce contradictory outputs. For example, if M(s1, s2) = 1, M(s2, s3) = 1, and M(s1, s3) = −1 a long/short portfolio could not be formed without violating some of the outputs of M. Fortunately, contradictory outputs can be avoided if M is constrained to be a preference relation. A preference relation is a binary relation with following properties: 1. Irreflexivity: ∀ s ∈ S : M(s, s) = 0 (a security s can not be preferred over itself), 2. Asymmetricity: ∀ si, sj ∈ S : ( M(si, sj) = 1) = ⇒ (M(sj, si) = −1) (if si is preferred over sj, then sj can not be preferred over si), 3. Transitivity: ∀ si, sj, sk ∈ S : ( M(si, sj) = 1) ∧ (M(sj, sk) = 1) = ⇒ (M(si, sk) = 1) (if si is preferred over sj and sj is preferred over sk, then si must also be preferred over sk). These conditions induce strict partial ordering over a set of securities S, allowing an investor to rank securities according to some criterion, and ultimately form a portfolio which may include long posit...

> Statistical arbitrage is a prevalent trading strategy which takes advantage of mean reverse property of spread of paired stocks. Studies on this strategy often rely heavily on model assumption. In this study, we introduce an innovative model-free and reinforcement learning based framework for statistical arbitrage. For the construction of mean reversion spreads, we establish an empirical reversion time metric and optimize asset coefficients by minimizing this empirical mean reversion time. In the trading phase, we employ a reinforcement learning framework to identify the optimal mean reversion strategy. Diverging from traditional mean reversion strategies that primarily focus on price deviations from a long-term mean, our methodology creatively constructs the state space to encapsulate the recent trends in price movements.

Additionally, the reward function is carefully tailored to reflect the unique characteristics of mean reversion trading. Keywords— Statistical Arbitrage, Mean Reversion Trading, Empirical Mean Reversion Time, Reinforcement Learning JEL: C14, C61 1 Introduction Statistical arbitrage, also known as mean reversion trading or pairs trading, is an important trading strategy in the financial markets. The essence of statistical arbitrage lies in creating spreads or portfolios from the market that exhibit mean-reverting characteristics, thereby unlocking opportunities for profit. For instance, if the price of a spread falls below its long-term mean, a trader might take a long position and then wait until its price correction, aiming to profit from this adjustment. The approach to statistical arbitrage unfolds in three distinct steps: First, it entails the identification of two or more securities that have shown a historical pattern of moving together. Next, a mean-reverting spread is formulated from these correlated securities. The final step involves taking a position when the spread deviates from its long-term mean, leveraging the anticipated return to equilibrium to generate profits. Therefore, mean reversion trading is divided into three main elements: (1) the identification of securities with co-movements, (2) the construction of mean-reverting spreads, and (3) the development of a tr...

The out-of-sample backtest result proves that our strategy can outperform the S&P500 index and suffered less drawdown during financial crisis period. It has great implication on how we can manage the risk of traditional pairs trading strategy in a more systematic manner.

> Automated market makers (AMMs) are a new type of trading venues which are revolutionising the way market participants interact. At present, the majority of AMMs are constant function market makers (CFMMs) where a deterministic trading function determines how markets are cleared. Within CFMMs, we focus on constant product market makers (CPMMs) which implements the concentrated liquidity (CL) feature. In this thesis we formalise and study the trading mechanism of CPMMs with CL, and we develop liquidity provision and liquidity taking strategies. Our models are motivated and tested with market data. We derive optimal strategies for liquidity takers (LTs) who trade orders of large size and execute statistical arbitrages. First, we consider an LT who trades in a CPMM with CL and uses the dynamics of prices in competing venues as market signals.

We derive optimal strategies for strategic liquidity providers (LPs) who provide liquidity in CPMM with CL. First, we use stochastic control tools to derive a self-financing and closed-form optimal liquidity provision strategy where the width of the LP’s liquidity range is determined by the profitability of the pool, the dynamics of the LP’s position, and concentration risk. Next, we use a model-free approach to solve the problem of an LP who provides liquidity in multiple CPMMs with CL. We do not specify a model for the stochastic processes observed by LPs, and use a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to approximate the optimal liquidity provision strategy.

Compared to the traditional cointegration analysis, our proposed matrix cointegration model better preserves the inherent structure of the data and enables corresponding interpretations. To estimate the cointegrating vectors as well as other coefficients, we introduce two types of estimators based on least squares and maximum likelihood. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the cointegrated matrix autoregressive model under the existence of trend and establish the asymptotic distributions for the cointegrating vectors, as well as other model parameters.

All the proofs and some additional theorems and simulations are collected in Appendix 6. Notations. For ease of reading, here we highlight some notations that are frequently used. Throughout this paper, we use the bold uppercase letters for matrices (e.g. X t), and the bold lowercase letters for vectors (e.g. x). We use ∥ · ∥F and ∥ · ∥s to denote the matrix Frobenius norm and spectral norm respectively. The Kronecker product of two matrices is denoted by ⊗. Note that the notations Gij, Bij refer to some new matrices to be defined later, and they should not be regarded as entries of G or B. For any d1 × d2 matrix β of full rank (assuming d1 ≤ d2), we denote 3 by β⊥ a d1 × (d1 − d2) matrix of rank d1 − d2 such that β′β⊥ = 0. We define ¯β = β(β′β)−1, such that β′ ¯β = I d2, and Pβ = ¯ββ′ is the projection of Rd1 onto the space spanned by the columns of β. We use ∆ to denote the difference operator such that ∆ xt = xt − xt−1. 2 Cointegrated Matrix Autoregression Models 2.1 Cointegrated Vector Autoregression Models To fix notations, we briefly introduce some basic concepts about the cointegrated vector autoregression models (CVAR).

Although backtests show differences between train and test results, some top pairs display strong signals, integration and positive risk-adjusted gains over both (train and test) periods, indicating feasibility, in terms real-life trading. Overall this study connects ethical investing and statistical arbitrage, providing a framework positioned to traverse markets, while upholding sustainability values. Future work would involve application of this strategy to high-frequency data in order to uncover more trading opportunities and understand short term price moves, despite increased complexity. Additional dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE could reveal new data patterns missed by PCA. Exploring clustering algorithms beyond OPTICS may provide fresh insights and alternative pairs. Machine learning approaches could dynamically determine entry and exit points, thereby adapting the strategy to evolving markets. The model could also integrate other performance factors like macroeconomic and sentiment indicators or more nuanced ESG metrics. In summary, integrating highfrequency data, new dimensionality and clustering techniques, and advanced machine learning promises an adaptive, robust strategy aligning of financial and sustainability objectives. Declaration of Interests The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> In Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb), classical mean reversion trading strategies typically hinge on asset-pricing or PCA based models to identify the mean of a synthetic asset. Once such a (linear) model is identiﬁed, a separate mean reversion strategy is then devised to generate a trading signal. With a view of generalising such an approach and turning it truly data-driven, we study the utility of Autoencoder architectures in StatArb. As a ﬁrst approach, we employ a standard Autoencoder trained on US stock returns to derive trading strategies based on the OrnsteinUhlenbeck (OU) process. To further enhance this model, we take a policy-learning approach and embed the Autoencoder network into a neural network representation of a space of portfolio trading policies. This integration outputs portfolio allocations directly and is end-to-end trainable by backpropagation of the risk-adjusted returns of the neural policy. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that this innovative end-to-end policy learning a...

This architec ture, as we will demonstrate, surpasses prevalent benchmark solutions in StatArb trading, offering improvements in terms of return before cost and reducing modelling risk at every stage of the process. 2. Related Work The concept of StatArb trading, as we deﬁne it, ﬁnds its roots in the foundational work of Avellaneda & Lee (2010). Their basic idea is that price changes follow the differenti al equation dPt Pt = αdt + n∑ j=1 βjF (j) t + dXt where Xt is a stationary mean reverting process, referred to as the cointegration residual, Pt is the price of a security at time t, α a drift term, and βj factor exposures for the risk-factors F (j) t . Statistical arbitrage is the generalisation of pairs-trading in which n = 1 . They show how modelling the risk factors as industry ETFs or principal components and modelling the residual process as a mean reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, one can derive a proﬁtable trading strategy. Y eo & Papanicolauou (2017) further reﬁne the idea to include risk controls depending on the speed of mean reversion of residuals. There is a proliferation of factors and asset pricing models in the ﬁnancial literature ( Harvey et al. , 2016; Feng et al. , 2019). The seminal contributions in this space were performed by Sha...

Thiscanbe seen when we compare long-only strategy volatilities.During the Covid Pandemic they’re long-only strategyhad anannual volatilityof 6.73%[6]. Our portfolioontheother hand, never went below an annual volatility of7.43% and over the four years averaged an annualvolatility of 9.05%. Strategies such asincreasingthetimewindowinput for themodel or increasingthenumber of attention heads were used to try and counteract this butprovided minimal or worse results. Further volatilitymitigation strategies were tested including doubling thenumber of stocks in the portfolio fromeach sector to tenbut this caused alargelynegativeresult. Thisislikelydueto the fact that equities tend to exhibit high covariance.We tried to mitigate this by diversifying sectorally butthen each of the five companies fromthat sector exhibithigh covariance with each other. Thisidea, however, fallsshort after looking into the annual covariances of returnsfor our portfoliowhichall appear reasonablylow. Image4: CovarianceMatrixHeatmapfor 15companiesin2022 Another potential issue we noticed was the CPDwasalmost always producing a high confidence change. It’s 6 believed that this was due to howvolatile equitiescanbeand likely whythemodel didbetter without theCPD.Thislead to the idea that maybe more attention heads coulddiscern something from the noise that was theChangepoint features but it only narrowly improved themodel and still didn’t beat the model without it. We alsodidn’t have the long-termCPDwhich would havehelpedin long-term trend changes which we can actually see afewoccur duringthistime.Future work should look to include this long-termCPD with a larger number of attention heads for themodel to better determine temporal relationships amongreturns, MACD, and CPD features.

> In this paper we propose a new method for finding stat-arbs that can contain multiple (more than two) assets, with general weights. The problem is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem in which we maximize the portfolio price variation subject to the price staying within a fixed band, along with a leverage limit, over some training period. Although this approach requires maximizing a convex function, we show how to approximately solve it using the convex-concave procedure [SDGB16, LB16]. Our second contribution is to introduce the concept of a moving-band stat-arb, in which the price of the portfolio varies in a band that changes over time, centered at the recent average portfolio price. (We refer to a traditional stat-arb as a fixed-band stat-arb.) We show that the same method we...

> . However, our problem differs significantly in that we do not rely on any co-integration analysis or statistical testing. Rather, we directly optimize for a high variance portfolio that is mean-reverting. Asset pairs can also be found using machine learning methods. In [SH20], the authors use unsupervised learning and propose a density-based clustering algorithms to cluster assets. Then, within asset clusters, pairs of assets are chosen for trading depending on cointegration, as well as mean-reversion tendency and frequency. Modern machine learning methods are also explored in [KDH17], where the authors propose the use of deep neural networks, gradient-boosted trees, and random forests for finding stat-arb portfolios. Another recent study of deep-learning stat-arb finding is [GOPZ21]. Earlier work on using machine learning for finding stat-arbs includes, e.g., [DKB15, MZ14, TL13, Huc10, Huc09]. 4 Modeling the stat-arb spread. When a co-moving set of assets has been identified, the next step is to model the portfolio price (or spread between the assets for a pair). Perhaps the most popular approach is to model the spread using stochastic control theory. It is common to consider investments in a mean-reverting spread and a risk-free asset and to model the spread as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [MPW08, JY07]. Other methods include those borrowing tools from time series analysis [Kra17]. In [EVDHM05] the authors propose a mean-reverting Gaussian Markov chain model for model...

> In this paper we consider the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaRα) defined asρ(ξδ T ) = E[ξδ T | ξδ T ≥ VaRα(ξδ T )], where α ∈ (0, 1) and VaRα(ξδ T ) is the Value-at-Risk defined asVaRα(ξδ T ) = minc{c : P(ξδ T ≤ c) ≥ α}. The CVaR is a commonly used objective function in the deep hedging literature, see for instance Carbonneau and Godin (2021), Cao et al. (2023) or Wu and Jaimungal (2023). In addition, an appealing feature of the CVaR is that it allows to finetune the investor’s attitude towards risk through the confidence level. A high value ofα puts more emphasis on risk reduction, whereas a low value of α penalizes losses and rewards gains. Each time-t action δt+1 is a feedback-type decision, being a function of the information currently available on the market:δt+1 = ˜δ(Xt) for some func...

• **Abstract Reference**:
> The recent work of Horikawa and Nakagawa (2024) claims that under a complete market admitting statistical arbitrage, the difference between the hedging position provided by deep hedging and that of the replicating portfolio is a statistical arbitrage. This raises concerns as it entails that deep hedging can include a speculative component aimed simply at exploiting the structure of the risk measure guiding the hedging optimisation problem. We test whether such finding remains true in a GARCH-based market model, which is an illustrative case departing from complete market dynamics. We observe that the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging is a speculative overlay if the risk measure considered does not put sufficient relative weight on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, a suitable choice of risk measure can prevent the deep hedging agent from engaging in speculation. JEL classification: C45, C61, G32.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been adapted for time series prediction with significant success in pattern recognition. However, the common belief is that these models are not suitable for predicting financial market returns, which are known to be almost random. We aim to challenge this misconception through a counterexample. Specifically, we utilize the Chronos model from Ansari et al. (2024) and test both pretrained configurations and fine-tuned supervised forecasts on the largest American single stocks using data from GuijarroOrdonnez et al. (2021). We construct a long/short portfolio, and the performance simulation indicates that LLMs can in reality handle time series that are nearly indistinguishable from noise, demonstrating an ability to identify inefficiencies amidst randomness and generate alpha. Finally, we compare these results with benchmark models, highlighting significant room for improvement in LLM performance to further enhance their predictive capabilities. ∗Machina...

However the question remains whether a Large Language Model optimized for time series outside the field of finance is sufficiently intelligent and sensitive to capture inefficiencies and market anomalies.

> In this study, we explore the synergy of deep learning and financial market applications, focusing on pair trading. This market-neutral strategy is integral to quantitative finance and is apt for advanced deep-learning techniques. A pivotal challenge in pair trading is discerning temporal correlations among entities, necessitating the integration of diverse data modalities. Addressing this, we introduce a novel framework, Multi-modal Temporal Relation Graph Learning (MTRGL). MTRGL combines time series data and discrete features into a temporal graph and employs a memory-based temporal graph neural network. This approach reframes temporal correlation identification as a temporal graph link prediction task, which has shown empirical success.

> Consider A = {A1, A2, ..., An} as a collection of n entities under examination, where entities may represent companies, assets, or markets. Each entity Ai is linked with a dynamic feature vector Xi(t) = (x(1)(t), x(2)(t), ..., x(m)(t)), with each entry x(j)(t) signifying the j-th feature of entity Ai at a given time t (for instance, sector name, trading volume, market share, and so on). We useX (t) to denote the collection of feature vectors associated with A at time t. Moreover, Pi(t) : t 7→ R is the trading price time series of entity Ai, and we denote Pi([0, t]) as the time series information of entity Ai in the time interval [0, t] for a certain t > 0. Let P = {Pi(t)} denote the set of time series linked to the entity set A. Similarly, P([0, t]) = {Pi([0, t])|Pi(.) ∈ P} represents the set of all entities’ time series associated with the time interval [0, t]. As previously discussed, a crucial aspect of pair trading is to discern the temporal correlation among entities based on their historical and feature information. More formally, if we denote S(Pi(t), Pj(t)), e.g., the normalized historical difference (NHD) [1], as a predetermined correlation measure of two time series and γ as a defined threshold, the aim is, given a set of entities A, their feature vectors X , and their time series information P([0, T]), to identify pairs of entities Ai, Aj such that S(pi([T, T + δ]), pj([T, T + δ])) ≥ γ for some δ > 0. 3.1.

> The Fractional Stochastic Regularity Model (FSRM) is an extension of Black-Scholes model describing the multifractal nature of prices. It is based on a multifractional process with a random Hurst exponent Ht, driven by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. When the regularity parameter Ht is equal to 1/2, the efficient market hypothesis holds, but when Ht ̸= 1/2 past price returns contain some information on a future trend or mean-reversion of the log-price process.

> [29, 46], there has been an enormous literature on rough volatility, which is now a widespread model [12, 35, 37, 38, 39]. These developments about rough volatility, verified by empirical observations [36], encourage us to consider the fOU as a dynamic describing the time-varying Hurst exponent. This is the purpose of FSRM. Regarding the robustness of the inference of the global Hurst exponent 2 of such a model, it has been shown that many estimators [71], relying only on single moments of the distribution of returns, introduce non-linear biases by creating artificial roughness when H > 1/2 [4]. However, a recent method based on the Lamperti transform showed that even using the entire distribution of returns, the estimate of the global Hurst exponent is very rough [15]. Besides its link with log-volatility, the Hurst exponent of log-prices also has an interesting interpretation since a Hurst exponent of 1 /2 is related to the efficient market hypothesis, whereas values greater or lower than 1/2 underline the opportunity of statistical arbitrages. Obviously, in the FSRM, the regularity Ht, being modelled by a fOU augmented by a long-term average H = 1/2, is not constrained to be in the interval (0 , 1) as it should be. Therefore, we can work with a new variable eHt such as eHt = 1 2 + 1 π arctan  Ht − 1 2  . (11) With this transformation the new regularity eHt is well defined in the interval (0 , 1). 3.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> : This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach in multivariate pair trading, termed the Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We present a method for selectively forming a “bucket” of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities simultaneously. To address quantitative conflicts from multiple trading signals, a novel bi-objective convex optimization formulation is designed to balance investor preferences between profitability and risk tolerance. We understand that cryptocurrencies carry significant financial risks. Therefore this process includes tunable parameters such as volatility penalties and action thresholds. In experiments conducted in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022, which encompassed a vigorous bull run followed by a bear run, the OTT achieved an annualized profit of 15.49%. Additionally, supplementary experiments detailed in the appendix extend the applicability of OTT to other major cryptocurrencies in the post-CO...

The arbitrage operation offers a new perspective on trading, without requiring external shorting or holding the intermediate during the arbitrage period. As a note of caution, this study acknowledges the high-risk nature of cryptocurrency investments, which can be subject to significant volatility and potential loss. Keywords: pair trading; multivariate; quantitative trading; cryptocurrency market 1. Introduction The secondary market functions as a modern, efficient form of double auction where participants intending to trade assets submit their acceptable bid and ask prices. The highest bid and lowest ask are matched if the prices meet. We believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which posits that in the secondary market, prices should reflect all available information (Fama 1970). However, historical economic bubbles show that investors do not always act rationally. Dale et al. (2005) illustrated how an order book filled with irrational bids and asks could drive prices in the wrong direction. Identifying inefficiencies in an efficient market helps maintain trading equilibrium. Market directional trading involves astute traders estimating more accurate prices for instruments. They then place orders with the expectation that the market will revert to rationality. Traders who bet correctly are rewarded by the market mechanism, contributing to price discovery. Quantitative trading, instead of relying on expe...

Despite the unique market conditions during the pandemic, the method maintained its effectiveness, demonstrating its adaptability and resilience across different market environments. The application of multiple cryptocurrencies demonstrates the universality of the OTT, which is adoptable for not only the ETH but other financial instruments that meet the instrument assumptions. SOL, on the other hand, constitutes an outlier example of pair trading under extreme market conditions. This adaptability is crucial for traders seeking consistent returns amidst varying market dynamics.

Example of cumulative returns with non optimized parameters 14 Figure 10. Example of cumulative returns with optimized parameters 4. F urther improvements 4.1. Computational limitations First, if we compute all the different pairs in an assets of n companies, there will be: C2 n =  n 2  = n! 2!(n − 2)! = n(n − 1) 2 . (10) At some point, we will want to limit the pairs we calculate. Instead of limiting the number of companies, we can choose to significantly increase the number of companies and randomly select pairs of companies. We won’t have all possible pairs, but we’ll have enough to expect satisfactory results. We could try selecting companies from different sectors or from the same sector if the results are not satisfactory. 4.2. Profitability of pair trading Another problem, perhaps the most important one is, that pair trading is becoming increasingly difficult to be profitable, but its profitability will increase with the size of the assets pool[3], as well as trying to identify the pairs that are less noticeable on the market. A novel method could be that we compute not only the assets pair but also evaluate the time series data or external factors, like the weather for instance. 4.3. Machine Learning Instead of optimizing only θout and θin, it would be possible to try optimizing other parameters, such as the threshold parameters (correlation and p-value) and the length of the periods. 15 5. Conclusion In this paper, we discussed the fundamental concepts and methodology of pair trading, primarily driven by correlation and cointegration analysis. We also performed basic numerical and mathematical calculations.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> . We study the loan contracts offered by decentralised loan protocols (DLPs) through the lens of financial derivatives. DLPs, which effectively are clearinghouses, facilitate transactions between option buyers (i.e. borrowers) and option sellers (i.e. lenders). The loan-to-value at which the contract is initiated determines the option premium borrowers pay for entering the contract, and this can be deduced from the non-arbitrage pricing theory. We show that when there are no market frictions, and there is no spread between lending and borrowing rates, it is optimal to never enter the lending contract. Next, by accounting for the spread between rates and transactional costs, we develop a deep neural network-based algorithm for learning trading strategies on the external markets that allow us to replicate the payoff of the lending contracts that are not necessarily optimally exercised. This allows hedge the risk lenders carry by issuing options sold to the borrowers, which can complement...

Trading cryptocurrency is difficult due to the inherent volatility of the crypto market. This study investigates whether Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance decision-making in cryptocurrency algorithmic trading compared to traditional methods. In order to address this question, we combined reinforcement learning with a statistical arbitrage trading technique, pair trading, which exploits the price difference between statistically correlated assets. We constructed RL environments and trained RL agents to determine when and how to trade pairs of cryptocurrencies. We developed new reward shaping and observation/action spaces for reinforcement learning.

> is supported by the higher values of Calmar, Sortino, and modified information ratios obtained by various versions of the strategy which used the classifiers when compared to the one that didn’t. The improvement seemed to stem from the successful reduction of the volume of unprofitable signals traded. The best results have been observed when using the weighted soft voting ensemble of classifiers. • RQ2: To what extent, does the implementation of transaction and risk management measures to influence the performance of the strategy? - After performing the sensitivity analysis, in which the impact of removing the implemented optimization has been measured, it can be concluded that their influence is limited. The addition of neither the Kelly criterion nor stop loss and take profit function modification has led to an increase in the Information Ratio*. However, the latter seems to have a moderate positive effect on downside and tail risk reduction. Thus the novel approach of multiplying the stop functions by the predicted probability of the signal’s profitability as well as the time-variant factor seems to have potential for further examination. The very limited impact of the usage of the Kelly criterion is most likely caused by the very rudimentary and simple implementation. • RQ3: What is the sensitivity of the strategy to changes in transaction costs? - Sensitivity analysis has clearly demonstrated that the changes in transaction costs have a limited impact on strategy performance. Strategy can be considered robust to changes of that parameter, as doubling it resulted in only a 10% drop of Information Ratio*. • RQ4: To what extent does the change of weights in the classifiers ensemble influence the strategy- Changes of weights used in the construction of the ensemble have a measurable impact on the performance of the strategy. Sensitivity analysis suggests, that both equally weighted ensemble and selection of only the best classifier lead to results that are worse than weighted ensemble with the increased weight of the best-performing model. It needs to be acknowledged, that the study is constrained by certain limitations. Firstly, the data quality in the Yahoo finance database is certainly not perfect. Although the reproducing of the methodology of Cartea et. al.

However, while these methods are useful for exploiting inductive biases in data used in any domain, their use for ﬁnancial time series data has been less explored. Time series data exhibits distinct characteristics, such as seasonality, trend, and interaction between stocks, which require careful consideration when designing SSL frameworks. Furthermore, the non-stationary nature of ﬁnancial markets necessitates the development of techniques that can adapt to distribution shifts and generalize well to future time periods. Most existing SSL methods focus on learning invariant representations (Chen et al. 2020, He et al. 2020), assuming that the data distribution remains stationary. However, this assumption does not hold in the context of ﬁnancial markets, where the underlying dynamics can change over time. To address these challenges, we combine techniques from SSL and the ﬁeld of temporal domain generalization. Our approach aims to learn general model representations that can adapt to temporal shifts over time, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of ﬁnancial parameter estimation using learned embeddings. By incorporating temporal domain generalization into the SSL framework, we enable the model to learn representations that are not only informative but also resilient to...

Second, a series of lagged residuals are used to construct the portfolio weights in the residual space, using a Long Convolution model for sequence modeling. Finally, the portfolio weights are mapped back to the asset space via a composition matrix, giving the next-period portfolio return. statistical factors model the factor portfolio weights and loadings as functions of characteristics.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work (1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce CTBench, the first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain. CTBench curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-...

Synthetic series are used to train forecasting models, which are then evaluated on real market data. Performance reflects how well the synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional structures critical for downstream prediction. • Statistical Arbitrage Task: This task examines whether TSG models can capture tradable structures by reconstructing historical returns. The residuals from the reconstruction are modeled as mean-reverting signals and fed into statistical arbitrage strategies. Financial metrics on profitability and risk profiles evaluate whether the synthetic data reveal useful trading signals suitable for profitable trading. C3: We construct a holistic financial evaluation measure suite tailored to crypto trading realities. Regarding L3, to facilitate thorough and realistic financial analyses, CTBench incorporates a comprehensive suite of evaluation measures over diverse trading strategies (§3.3) spanning forecasting performance, rank-based predictive measures, key trading performance indicators, and critical risk assessment metrics (§3.4).

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we introduce CTBench, the first benchmark tailored for TSG in cryptocurrency markets. CTBench integrates a curated high-frequency crypto dataset, a dual-task evaluation framework encompassing Predictive Utility and Statistical Arbitrage, and a rich suite of financial metrics designed to assess both statistical fidelity and real-world viability. Through extensive empirical analysis, we uncover critical trade-offs across TSG families and offer practical guidance for deploying models under diverse market conditions. As a collaborative resource, CTBench aims to foster rigorous evaluation and drive innovation in crypto time series modeling. Moving forward, we plan to expand CTBench by incorporating new tokens, extending to cross-exchange data, and integrating more advanced TSG architectures. We are also exploring model ensembling and regime-aware switching to improve robustness and performance consistency. To further streamline experimentation, we intend to support automated evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, enhancing both efficiency and usability. 12

Although the currencies in the triplet are theoretically interrelated—both among themselves and with interest rates (IRs)—no prior work has studied a graph learning (GL) method to exploit these relationships in FX rate prediction (FXRP). As multiple currencies exist globally, combinatorially many triplets can be formed, each inducing its own theoretical interrelations. It is difficult to represent such structured relationships in a tabular format and to employ canonical neural architectures, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Moreover, the interest rate parity (IRP) implies there is an interaction be...

• **Abstract Reference**:

In the first step, to capture complex multi-currency and currency–interest rate relationships, we formulate FXRP as an edge-level regression problem on a discrete-time spatiotemporal graph. This graph consists of currencies as nodes and exchanges as edges, with interest rates and foreign exchange rates serving as node and edge features, respectively. We then introduce a graph-learning method that leverages the spatiotemporal graph to address the FXRP problem.

In the first stage, we formulate FXRP as an edge-level regression problem on a discretetime spatiotemporal graph to capture complex multi-currency and currency–IR relationships. We present a GL method to address the FXRP problem, leveraging the spatiotemporal graph defined with currencies and exchanges as nodes and edges, respectively, where IRs serve as node features, and FX rates serve as edge features. In the second stage, we present a stochastic optimization problem to exploit FXSAs while accounting for the observation-execution time lag. To solve this problem, we propose a GL method that enforces constraints through projection and ReLU to maximize the information ratio, while utilizing the predictions from the FXRP method for the constraint parameters and node features. We prove our GL method satisfies the empirical arbitrage constraints. Our GL method for FXSA uses a graph in which nodes represent exchanges and edges encode their influences. Experimental results show our FXRP method achieves statistically significant improvements over non-graph methods. Moreover, our FXSA method achieves a 61.89% higher information ratio and a 45.51% higher Sortino ratio than the benchmark. Our approach presents a novel perspective on FX prediction and StatArbs through the lens of GL.

We assess thirteen state-of-the-art models using a multi-round evaluation that separates structural reliability (whether the backtest runs) from numerical accuracy (mean absolute error of the backtest metrics), assigning failed outputs a duplicated-metrics baseline MAE.

Furthermore, the options delta dataset for Strategy 3 was generated using a simple random walk. 3.2 HIGH-LEVELSTRATEGYDESCRIPTIONS Strategy 1: Scheduled market-order execution on MSFT.Strategy 1 uses data from Databento’s Market-by-price L10 data for Microsoft (MSFT). At pre-specified timestamps in the data, the strategy sends a market order to either buy or sell various quantities of MSFT. Each market order takes liquidity from the current book, net of previous trades at that price level and potentially from several price levels at once. The strategy tracks: • Cash and MSFT position, • Realized P&L using FIFO accounting, • Unrealized P&L based on raw-book mid-prices, • An equity curve and maximum drawdown, • Synthetic-book statistics such as total size available and bid/ask VW AP post model trades. Strategy 2: Pairs mean-reversion on Coke and Pepsi stock.Strategy 2 is a pairs trading strategy between KO and PEP which uses L10 order book data from both. At each new book update for either symbol, the strategy calculates mid-prices for both symbols and creates a spread between them as a linear combination of the two. A rolling history of the spread is then used to calculate a mean and the z-score of the current value. The strategy has a position state (flat, long-spread, or short-spread). When the z-score exceeds an entry threshold, the strategy enters a mean-reversion...

### 📊 結果與討論 (Results & Discussion)
• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> We present MARKET-BENCH, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on introductory quantitative trading tasks that require both accuracy and consistency. By analyzing 329 total attempts across three unique trading strategies, we find that: • Current models lack the capabilities to simulate and understand even basic trading strategies. • Many models can reliably produce executable backtests on simpler strategies, but a subset fails catastrophically on more complex ones. • Model error varies widely, especially on the most realistic Strategy 3, where small implementation differences can generate huge P&L and risk discrepancies. We hope MARKET-BENCHcan serve as a foundation for future work on large language models that are not just capable of describing strategies but also implementing them in a way that demonstrates deep understanding of market dynamics, risk, and trading mechanics.

According to this property, segmented signatures can be used naturally in pair trading, which leads to a strategy of pair trading capturing the complex relationships of assets.

While advanced statistical arbitrage and deep learning enhance high-frequency data processing, they diminish opportunities for traditional methods and yield less interpretable, unstable strategies. Consequently, developing stable, interpretable quantitative strategies remains a priority in futures markets. In this study, we propose a novel pair trading strategy by leveraging the mathematical concept of path signature which serves as a feature representation of time series. Specifically, the path signature is decomposed into two new indicators: the path interactivity indicator segmented signature and the directional indicator covariation of increments, which serve as double filters in strategy design.

Key words: Rough Path, Signature Method, Quantitative Finance, Pair Trading 1 arXiv:2505.05332v2 [econ.GN] 16 Oct 2025 1 Introduction In financial market, robust, consistently profitable strategies and indicators are pursued by participators. Among them, arbitrage strategies are generally considered as a comparatively lower-risk investment approach, hedging most market risks through simultaneously buying and selling multiple financial assets (Dybvig & Ross, 1989; Yadav & Pope, 1990; Liew & Wu, 2013; Krauss, 2017). Pair trading (Vidyamurthy, 2004; Elliott et al., 2005) is one of the popular and widely used statistical arbitrages in trading stocks (Chen et al., 2019), futures and options (Draper & Fung, 2002). The core concept of pair trading involves trading the price spread between two correlated assets. When their prices spread deviates from the expected value, the pair trading strategy involves going long on one relatively undervalued asset while shorting the other relatively overvalued one and closing the positions for profit after the spread reverts to normal levels. Arbitrage opportunities typically arise in imperfect markets. However, as more market participants exploit these opportunities, the price spread tends to disappear quickly (Krauss, 2017). What’s more, in highly complex financial markets, just capturing linear corre...

• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> s We presented a systematic approach to Pairs Trading — a popular Statistical Arbitrage technique. In the usual approach pair of similarly behaving assets is selected and trades are performed on an offset portfolio of the two- we decided to substitute the second equity with a linear combination of risk (systematic) actors replicating the first (main) one. The aim then was to analyse residuals of main asset and its corresponding systematic components’ approximation. Based on their potential mean-reversion properties, trading signals were determined trying to profit from potential technical mispricings. The selection of risk factors was done using three techniques: creating them with Principal Components Analysis (PCA) from eigenvectors of returns’ empirical correlation matrix, using real market indices, and as a new method that was not covered in the literature of the subject yet: considering Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). There are two main contributions made within the paper: re-defining and testing already discussed techniques of PCA and market indices [4] on a far less developed equities market of Poland; and, as already mentioned, the introduction of new deep learning based approach of deriving the risk factors. Applying techniques of Statistical Arbitrage presented by Avellaneda and Lee [4] to polish stock exchange required switching from around500stocks’ portfolios to just60most influential companies gathered by two main indices:WIG20andmWIG40. Since the spectrum of exchange traded funds of market indices is also way narrower than in the US, some simplifications had to be made for the ETFs approach. Two sub-techniques were discussed: one using only existing funds to replicate and other relying on artificial ones created as direct copies of sector indices. Additional market factors such as transaction costs or risk free rate were also adjusted from 2008 paper[4] for better reality matching. Second contribution i.e. LSTM approach of replicating stocks’ returns was constructed to check whether more flexibility can be gained by not limiting oneself to common market factors and instead creating unique portfolios on a basis of singular stocks. Network was trained to provide the most appropriate weightings of all companies’ shares to approximate returns of the main one. Since it is possibly the first documented use of LSTMs in this, exact context- some steps such as the search for the most optimal hyperparameters were skipped to focus on initial

> We work with a financial market that contains a risk-free numeraire asset, which is normalized to one, andd≥1 risky assets. Notice that the numeraire of our investment universe is chosen in such a way that ergodicity assumptions can reasonably hold true. We assume that the risky asset price processX= (X 1, . . . , Xd) takes values in an open connected setE⊂R d. The processX 3 will depend on anm-dimensional stochastic factor processYtaking values in a connected open set D⊂R m for somem≥1. We setF=E×Dand in this paper will generically denote elements ofFbyz= (x, y) forx∈Eandy∈D. Similarly, gradients of a function ofztaken in only the x-variable will be denoted by∇ x and in only they-variable by∇ y and the full gradient denoted, as usual, by∇. For a vectorvof sized+m, we will writev X andv Y for the vector consisting of the firstdand finalmcomponents ofvrespectively. We take a triple (c, p, b Y ) as inputs to the problem for functionsc:F→S d+m ++ ,p:F→(0,∞) andb Y :F→R m. Here, for anyn∈N,S n ++ is the cone of symmetric positive definite matrices of sizen×n.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> Accurate volatility forecasts are vital in modern finance for risk management, portfolio allocation, and strategic decision-making. However, existing methods face key limitations. Fully multivariate models, while comprehensive, are computationally infeasible for realistic portfolios. Factor models, though efficient, primarily use static factor loadings, failing to capture evolving volatility co-movements when they are most critical. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, model-agnosticFactor-Augmented Volatility Forecast framework. Our approach employs a time-varying factor model to extract a compact set of dynamic, cross-sectional factors from realized volatilities with minimal computational cost. These factors are then integrated into both statistical and AI-based forecasting models, enabling a unified system that jointly models asset-specific dynamics and evolving market-wide co-movements. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across two prominent asset classes—la...

> 4.1 Volatility Factor Analysis Across Assets 4.1.1 Time-Varying Factor Model.Lety 𝑡 =(𝑅𝑉 1,𝑡, . . . , 𝑅𝑉𝑝,𝑡 ) denote the 𝑝-dimensional vector of realized volatilities at time 𝑡= 1, . . . , 𝑇. Following the time-varying matrix factor model of [ 11], we posit the locally-smooth factor representation: y𝑡 =Λ 𝑡 f𝑡 +𝜀 𝑡 ,(4) wheref 𝑡 ∈R 𝑘 is the 𝑘-dimensional latent factors, and𝜀𝑡 ∈R 𝑝 is the idiosyncratic errors, assumed to be uncorrelated withf𝑡 but allowed to exhibit weak serial dependence. To accommodate a wide range of potential smooth temporal variation, we specifyΛ𝑡 ∈R 𝑝×𝑘 to be the time-varying loading matrix. Specifically, we modelΛ 𝑡,𝑖 = Λ 𝑖· (𝑡/𝑇) , whereΛ 𝑖· (·) is an unknown smooth function of 𝑡/𝑇 on [0, 1] for each𝑖∈ [𝑝]. LetΣ 𝑓 =E( f𝑡 f ⊤ 𝑡 ) andΣ 𝜀 =E(𝜀 𝑡 𝜀⊤ 𝑡 ). The second uncentered moment satisfies Σ 𝑦,𝑡 :=E(y 𝑡 y⊤ 𝑡 )=Λ 𝑡 Σ 𝑓 Λ ⊤ 𝑡 +Σ 𝜀 .(5) Under mild regularity conditions, the rank -𝑘 signal component Λ 𝑡 Σ 𝑓 Λ ⊤ 𝑡 implies that the top𝑘 eigenvectors ofΣ 𝑦,𝑡 span the column space ofΛ 𝑡 up to rotation, as established in [11]. In principle, one could estimateΣ 𝑦,𝑡 using kernel smoothing in 𝑡/𝑇 as in [11]. For practical implementation, we instead adopt arolling -window(uniform -kernel) approximation. Fix a window length 𝑛 and define 𝑊𝑡 ={𝑡−𝑛+ 1, . . . , 𝑡}. We estimate the local covariance matrix by bΣ 𝑦,𝑡 = 1 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑠∈𝑊𝑡 y𝑠y⊤ 𝑠 = 𝑇∑︁ 𝑠=1 𝐾𝑛 (𝑠, 𝑡)y 𝑠y⊤ 𝑠 , 𝐾 𝑛 (𝑠, 𝑡)= 1 𝑛 1{𝑠∈𝑊 𝑡 }.

• **Conclusion / Key Findings**:
> This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic Factor-Augmented Volatility Forecast framework, resolving the trade-off between computationally infeasible multivariate models, overly simplistic univariate models, and rigid static-factor models. By extracting a compact set of dynamic factors and their time-varying loadings directly from realized volatilities, our frasmework allows any baseline model to efficiently capture evolving market-wide co-movements. The framework’s robust performance—evidenced by substantial gains in forecast accuracy and superior risk-adjusted returns—combined with its computational efficiency and interpretability, establishes it as a valuable and practical solution for dynamic risk management.

GCS-Q operates directly on the signed graph, avoiding lossy transformations.

This approach is well-suited to the signed graph setting where classical solvers offer only heuristic workarounds.

• **Abstract Reference**:
> .Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed, weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE andk-Medoids. Our experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties, ...

• **Model / Framework**:
> We consider a set of financial assetsA={a 1, a2, . . . , an}, whose historical returns over a rolling window are denoted byr i(t)for asseta i at timet. The pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients [21] are computed as: ρij = Cov(ri, rj) σri σrj , ρ ij ∈[−1,1].(2) These correlations define a signed, weighted, undirected graphG= (V, E, w), where each vertexv i ∈Vuniquely corresponds to asseta i, and each edge (vi, vj)∈Eis weighted byw ij =ρ ij. In contrast to traditional clustering methods that transform correlations into non-negative distances [7], we retain the signed correlations, thereby preserving both positive (co-movement) and negative (anti-correlation) relationships. We apply the GCS-Q algorithm, previously developed for coalition structure generation in graphs [30], to this asset clustering setting. The core contribution lies in adapting GCS-Q to leverage its ability to operate directly on the signed graphs without resorting to heuristic transformations. Formally, GCS-Q aims to find a coalition structureΠ={C 1, C2, . . . , Ck}, a partition ofVinto disjoint subsets, that maximizes the intra-cluster edge weights: max Π X C∈Π X i,j∈C i<j wij.(3) This objective promotes grouping of assets with strong positive correlations while implicitly disincentivizing inclusion of negatively correlated pairs within the same cluster. The GCS-Q algorithm proceeds iteratively, starting with the full graphG0 = G. At each iterationt, it computes a minimum cut(St, ¯St)on the current...
