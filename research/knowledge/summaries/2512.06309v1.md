**Abstract**


We consider a Kyle-type model where insider trading takes place among a potentially large
population of liquidity traders and is subject to legal penalties. Insiders exploit the liquidity provided by the trading masses to “camouflage” their actions and balance expected wealth with the
necessary stealth to avoid detection. Under a diverse spectrum of prosecution schemes, we establish the existence of equilibria for arbitrary population sizes and a unique limiting equilibrium. A
convergence analysis determines the scale of insider trading by a stealth index γ, revealing that
the equilibrium can be closely approximated by a simple limit due to diminished price informativeness. Empirical aspects are derived from two calibration experiments using non-overlapping
data sets spanning from 1980 to 2018, which underline the indispensable role of a large population in insider trading models with legal risk, along with important implications for the incidence
of stealth trading and the deterrent effect of legal enforcement.

### **1 Introduction**


The main objective of the present paper is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic link between
an insider’s trade size choices and the number of liquidity traders (or noise traders) during concurrent trading episodes, in uncovering and quantifying the level of stealth that insiders exercise in illicit
trading activity. The central methodology is based on a newly-constructed game-theoretic framework
(following Kyle (1985)) for insider trading that adapts to a wide variety of detection mechanisms
and penalty functions while incorporating the population size of liquidity traders. In this general
setting, the assumption of normally distributed liquidity trades is well supported by the large size of
the liquidity trading crowd and the independence among individual trades, and we shall show that an

equilibrium exists for any finite population of liquidity traders – a result that is in itself highly nontrivial. As the population size tends to infinity, we also establish the uniqueness of the corresponding
limiting equilibrium – a critical outcome of considering the entire trading crowd. The convergence
properties lead to the discovery of a stealth index γ that sets up a rigorous yet simple link between
insider trading and stealth trading. Such quantification sheds light upon the prevalence of an often
overlooked moderate stealth level in illicit insider trading, revealing an incentive whose dual dependence on both regulatory scrutiny and potential legal penalties illuminates practical interconnections
between market behavior and the legal enforcement landscape.

The canonical model of Kyle (1985) provides a foundational framework for understanding informed trading in financial markets by exploring how an insider (informed trader) with private information about an asset’s value trades strategically to maximize profit. It was demonstrated that the
insider’s trades are gradual and proportional to market liquidity, balancing profitability with informational concealment, [1] and the equilibrium reached highlights a tradeoff between information efficiency
and risks from market manipulation.

While the Kyle model does not explicitly address illicit insider trading – focusing instead on informational concealment for profit maximization rather than avoidance of legal penalties – many recent
studies have advanced the framework to incorporate the modeling of legal risk associated with illicit
trading for a comprehensive exploration of the price impact and strategic behavior influenced by the
_dual_ objectives of wealth expansion and penalty mitigation. For instance, Carré, Collin-Dufresne,
and Gabriel (2022) explicitly extended Kyle’s one-period model to a setting subject to legal penalties and analyzed insider trading regulations striking a balance between market liquidity and price
informativeness, and Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024), using data sourced from the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) case files across 1995 to 2018, argued that (illegal) insiders adjust
trading strategies as they internalize legal risk from regulators, and that legal enforcement is indeed
effective in deterring insider trading aggression and containing price informativeness. [2]


A notable feature in much of the literature along these lines, whether or not legal risks are considered, is the treatment of non-insider trades collectively as a single entity. In essence, these trades can
be thought of as being placed by a single (representative) liquidity (or noise) trader. [3] Indeed, without
legal risks, the number of liquidity traders is a relatively minor concern because the only potential
harm from insider trading – from an insider’s viewpoint – lies in reduced profits caused by their price
impact; as a result, it is optimal to trade at the same scale as the representative liquidity trader, or
equivalently, all liquidity traders combined. As legal risks arise, however, (illegal) insiders should
suppress their trade sizes further, as trading at comparable levels to the entirety of liquidity traders is
likely to expose them to legal repercussions. More precisely, it increases the likelihood of drawing
regulatory attention and triggering red flags (see, e.g., Picardo (2022)). This raises the following question: _How do insiders exploit the presence of a large crowd of liquidity traders (representing normal_
_trading activity) to moderate their trade sizes, thereby reducing detection risk while simultaneously_


1Developments in continuous time further highlight a gradual reduction in the tendency to conceal information towards
the time when the asset’s value becomes publicly known; see Back (1992), Back and Baruch (2004), and Caldentey and
Stacchetti (2010), among others.
2Additionally, Çetin (2025), adopting a continuous-time approach, found that legal risks can impede the optimality for
insiders to bring prices to the true valuation at the end of the trading episode.
3For example, in the original Kyle model, liquidity (noise) trading quantities are assumed to be normally distributed;
we also refer to Bagnoli, Viswanathan, and Holden (2001) and Boulatov, Kyle, and Livdan (2013) regarding the existence
and uniqueness properties of a (linear) equilibrium.

_mitigating price impact to maximize profits?_ In particular, with a sizeable population of liquidity
traders, it can be reasonably suspected that in equilibrium, while insiders still internalize legal risk
when devising their trading strategies, they no longer account for the risks through the profit channel,
as their consideration of price impact diminishes under the deterrent effect of legal consequences.

Although intuitive and seemingly natural, the understanding that the number of liquidity traders
should far exceed that of insider traders – on insider trading days – can be justified by various legal
and societal factors. First, laws against insider trading create a high barrier for engaging in it, and
criminal and civil penalties, including fines, disgorgement, and prison sentences, deter most traders
from engaging in insider trading (see, e.g., Patel and Putn, inš (2021) Sect. 1 and Kacperczyk and
Pagnotta (2024) Tab. I). [4] In addition, insider trading is contingent on access to material, non-public
information, which is generally restricted to a small group (such as executives and directors) within
firms, and only a minority of individuals within companies, or those heavily tied, have access to such
sensitive information. Present legal risk, the large pool of liquidity traders can effectively provide
insiders with the “necessary” cover to engage in illicit trading, while simultaneously reducing the
likelihood of immediate detection, and contrarily, absence of a substantial trading crowd would readily render such illegal activities apparent and swiftly prosecuted, e.g. due to the relatively low costs
associated with investigations, including legal and data analysis efforts (Picardo (2022)).
In psychological terms, this phenomenon is commonly known as the “ _camouflage effect_,” which
describes situations where individuals blend into a crowd to avoid detection while engaging in wrongful or harmful acts; see, e.g., Griskevicius _et al._ (2006). In the insider trading context, this “simple”
act of hiding was originally hinted at in the model of Kyle (1985), with the implication that when
maximizing profit, (illicitly) informed traders tend to camouflage their information by splitting up
their trades over time, while Admati and Pfeiderer (1988) argued that the same can also be achieved
by purposefully engaging in trading amid high liquidity volume.
Noteworthily, the camouflage effect is closely associated with the well-studied concept of “stealth
trading,” where informed traders strategically concentrate their trades in medium sizes. Intuitively,
faced with legal risk, informed traders tend to execute volumes smaller than the total volume during
periods of heavy trading activity to obscure their identities and reduce the likelihood of detection and
prosecution. Meanwhile, driven by a clear profit motive, they are also inclined to trade in significantly
larger volumes compared to the average liquidity trader. This phenomenon was early examined in
Meulbroek (1992) in studying the price impact of informed trades using data sourced from the SEC
case files over the 1980s. In particular, a notable finding is that the (daily) median ratio of the insider
trading volume to the target firms’ total trading volume is about 11%. A later study by Del Guercio,
Odders-White, and Ready (2017), utilizing SEC case files data from 2003 to 2011, has shown a
significantly reduced price impact in contrast with the finding of Meulbroek (1992). [5]


This consideration also leads to what is known as the “stealth trading hypothesis” in the literature,
originally proposed by Barclay and Warner (1993) in addressing the issue of informed traders’ choices
of trade sizes. The hypothesis predicts that medium-size (precisely defined as 500 to 9,900 shares)
trades come with disproportionately large cumulative price changes. Apart from their own empirical
evidence from a sample of NYSE firms between 1981 and 1984, there have been numerous studies


4According to recent reports, the SEC prosecuted a total of 583 enforcement actions in 2024, obtaining orders for $8.2
billion in financial remedies. See https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-186.
5This is ascribed to gradually increased prudence among insiders after 2000, likely in response to enhanced regulatory
measures (such as increased regulatory budgets and the introduction of the SEC Whistleblower Program).

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


over the years to confirm the predictions of this hypothesis. To name a few, using audit trail data from
NYSE firms, Chakravarty (2001) highlighted the disproportionately large role played by informed
traders utilizing medium-sized trades in driving price movements. Anand and Chakravarty (2007)
confirmed this preference for medium-sized trades in the options markets as well, particularly for
high-leverage options. However, it is worth noting that this tendency toward moderate trade sizes
is not consistently observed in non-U.S. markets, likely due to elevated levels of price manipulation
associated with liquidity trading (see Cai, Cai, and Keasey (2006)). Another empirical study by Frino
_et al._ (2013) shows that insiders’ trade sizes are largely affected by both the probability of detection
and expected penalty, and that insider volumes surpass liquidity trades at the individual level for a
specific expected return while falling below the aggregate level.
A natural implication from the last line is that if detection of insider trading is triggered with
abnormal order flow imbalances exceeding certain watermarks (see, e.g., DeMarzo, Fishman, and
Hagerty (1998) and Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024) Sect. II), then it would be optimal for insiders
to execute trades at medium levels where normal trades are conspicuous to reduce the likelihood
of detection. Alexander and Peterson (2007) referred to such occurrence as trade-size clustering,
documenting that NYSE and NASDAQ trades typically cluster around multiples of 500, 1,000, or
5,000 shares, associated with the greatest price impact, and the clustering strengthens with aggregate
trading activity; see also Chen (2019) for similar considerations for cryptocurrency trading. On the
other hand, using futures trading data, Chang, Pinegar, and Schachter (1997) showed that when large
speculative trades are singled out, a significantly stronger price–volume relationship is observed; see
also Blau (2017). The concentration of medium-sized trades has the econometric implication of
enhanced sparsity in trade size distributions despite significant overall trading volumes, as modeled
and demonstrated by Fei and Xia (2024). From different angles, these studies consistently support the
presence of stealth trading, confirming that informed traders camouflage their activities by favoring
medium-sized trades during periods of heavy market activity.
With the above considerations, we aim to develop a Kyle-type model (Section 2) with legal penalties (compare Carré, Collin-Dufresne, and Gabriel (2022) Sect. 2 and Çetin (2025) Sect. 2) that incorporates the liquidity trading population for a formal study of the camouflage effect in insider trading.
We quantify the camouflage effect by introducing a measure termed “stealth index,” gauging the level
of stealth (or caution) that insiders exercise in illicit trading (Section 3). Determination of this stealth
index relies in large part on the convergence of the corresponding equilibria as the liquidity trading population grows, which deciphers how insiders’ trade sizes vary with the number of liquidity
traders in addition to the severity of legal penalties. We would like to highlight that the resulting
limiting equilibrium can effectively reproduce a significantly reduced price impact which is adequate
for practical purposes when justified by the presence of a large trading crowd.
It is worth noting that such a study would not be possible with only a scale parameter tracking the
size of all liquidity trades (as adopted in Kyle (1985) Sect. 2). The reason is that with abnormal order
flow imbalance-based detection of insider trading (DeMarzo, Fishman, and Hagerty (1998)), market
liquidity is well factored by insiders, whereas regulatory investigations are conducted on a case-bycase basis, i.e., on the individual trader level rather than the volume of trades. [6] Also, given that
each liquidity trader places trades independently responding to idiosyncratic needs, the total liquidity
order flow is in proportion to their average trade size but _not_ their population size. This means that the


6What complicates the investigation process is not the total orders from liquidity traders, but their sheer number, thus
giving insiders the opportunity to “camouflage.”

particular size of liquidity trades does not directly contribute to the camouflage effect, which requires
a sufficiently large population to manifest. [7]

From a modeling perspective, the present paper also runs parallel to research on regulatory approaches to insider trading, including investigation schemes and the imposition of penalties. We
consider a flexible detection mechanism (Section 2.1) that is adaptive to the detection mechanism
postulated by DeMarzo, Fishman, and Hagerty (1998), who were among the first to consider the
optimal design of insider trading regulation. Besides, our choice of the penalty function covers combinations of civil penalties and criminal penalties, with civil penalties determined based on insiders’
illicit trading profit and criminal penalties depending primarily on their trading strategies. Aside from
reflecting practical scenarios encompassing both civil and criminal cases (detailed discussion in Section 2.2), this consideration is broad enough to include most forms of penalty functions discussed in
the literature, such as linear penalties (as in Carré, Collin-Dufresne, and Gabriel (2022) Sect. 3.4.2),
quadratic penalties (as in Shin (1996), Carré, Collin-Dufresne, and Gabriel (2022) Sect. 3.4.1, and
Çetin (2025)), and multiples of illicit profit (as in Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024) Sect. II). [8] In Section 3, we shall also demonstrate that such a penalty combination is materially significant by both
accounting for the nuances of realized illicit gains and assessing the pre-trade intent in determining
the appropriate legal charges.
In a theoretical construct, this paper focuses on the following main contributions:


  - Construct a Kyle-type model with legal risk incorporating a flexible detection mechanism as
well as both civil and criminal penalties, in which the number of liquidity traders can be large
(Section 2).


  - Propose a stealth index to quantify the camouflage effect in insider trading, implying that in
equilibrium, insiders prefer a trading intensity that lies strictly between that of an average liquidity trader and the combined activity of all liquidity traders (Section 3 and Section 6).


  - Conduct a thorough convergence analysis to show that using the limiting equilibrium (with
diminished price impact) as an approximate equilibrium offers great ease in computation while
not altering the equilibrium implications (Section 3 and Section 6).


Our model is also amenable to calibration to market data on insider trading volumes, while also
aligning with unresolved empirical findings from the literature. With the calibration experiments in
Section 5 based on two data sets, we confirm insiders’ internalization of legal risk from regulators
as well as the effectiveness of legal enforcement in deterring insider trading, along with reduced
price informativeness (Del Guercio, Odders-White, and Ready (2017) and Kacperczyk and Pagnotta
(2024)). On the other hand, insiders adjust their trade sizes according to the size of liquidity trades
(e.g., Barclay and Warner (1993) and Chakravarty (2001)) in attempting to disguise their trades for
legal risk avoidance, to such extent that their price impact asymptotically vanishes in equilibrium. All
main proofs are provided in Appendices A, B, and C, while the proofs of additional results and other
auxiliary details are presented in Supplemental Appendices A and B.


7This perspective will be further clarified by the formal mathematical treatment in Section 2.
8Notably, while criminal penalties are naturally nondecreasing in the (insider) trading strategy, in the case of civil
penalties, the expected penalty function is generally not symmetric or nondecreasing (see Section 4), and so it operates
outside the framework of Carré, Collin-Dufresne, and Gabriel (2022) and Çetin (2025).

### **2 A Kyle model with legal risk**



We begin with a description of our model framework. Following the standard one-period model of
Kyle (1985), the market features three types of agents trading a single risky asset with fundamental
value _V_, which is revealed, at time 1, to be 1 with probability 0 < _p_ < 1 and 0 otherwise.
There are a total of _N_ **liquidity traders** who will trade the asset non-strategically for exogenous
needs. At time 0, the liquidity traders have no prior access to the asset value _V_ and submit independent
orders with sizes being i.i.d. random variables with zero mean and variance σ [2] . Thus, with the central
limit theorem in place, we assume that the total (net) order flow from liquidity trading can be written
as √ _NW_, where _W_ =d. Normal(0, σ2) is independent of _V_ . There is a single (risk-neutral) **insider**



as _NW_, where _W_ =d. Normal(0, σ2) is independent of _V_ . There is a single (risk-neutral) **insider**

**trader** who observes the value _V_ at time 0 at no cost and in a strategic manner submits his order
_Z_ ( _V_ ) as a function of _V_, knowing that placing the order is likely to introduce a contemporary price
impact on the risky asset. At time 0, a competitive **market maker** sees the total (net) order flow
~~√~~



_NW_ + _Z_ ( _V_ ) = _Y_ and executes orders at some price _P_ ( _Y_ ) as a function of _Y_ . [9]



One major distinction from the standard Kyle model (and its variations with legal risk) is in the
**population size** of liquidity traders _N_, [10] which we expect to be “very large.” Beyond the practical
reasons for a large number of liquidity traders discussed in Section 1, a modeling perspective also
supports choosing a normal distribution for _W_ . Indeed, if the population size were small, any specific
distributional assumption (whether binomial, uniform, normal, etc.) would risk being overly restrictive; on the other hand, with a sufficiently large population size, independence among the liquidity
traders sets the ground for the normal approximation. [11]


**2.1** **Prosecution mechanism**


The insider trader is also aware of legal risk that he faces in the presence of a **regulator**, who initiates
investigations into his trading behavior by various means, such as detections of abnormal trading
activity (DeMarzo, Fishman, and Hagerty (1998)), market surveillance associated with corporate
events (Patel and Putn, inš (2021)), or informant reports (such as the SEC Whistleblower Program).
Once an investigation starts, prosecution of the insider will ensue depending on the actual trading
behavior. A general description of the prosecution mechanism event could be based on an independent
Bernoulli random variable _BN_ with strategy-dependent parameter, p _N_ ; that is, given his order _Z_ ( _V_ ) =
_z_ placed at time 0, the insider will be charged with illicit trading with probability p _N_ ( _z_ ) at time 1,
where the dependence on _z_ is implied by the regulator gaining access to the insider’s trading account.
More precisely, we consider this probability parameter, or the probability of successful prosecution,
in the following form:
p _N_ ( _z_ ) = 1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)], _z_ ∈ R, (2.1.1)


where λ _N_ ( _z_ ) ≥ 0 is interpreted as the **hazard rate** and is a _strictly_ increasing function in the magnitude
of _z_ ; contrarily, 1 − p _N_ ( _z_ ) = _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] is the probability of no investigation or a dismissal from court


9While taking account of his own price impact, the insider cannot design his trading strategy based on the orders from
the liquidity traders; in other words, the insider’s order is submitted no later than the realization of _W_ .
10If the one period (from time 0 to time 1) represents a generic insider trading episode, _N_ can also be regarded as the
total number of liquidity trades, assuming that each trade is placed by a different (liquidity) trader.
11We may use 30 as a practical threshold – following conventional statistical guidelines – to show that the population
size is large enough for this approximation to take hold. In our convergence analysis later, however, a larger value of _N_
may be required to ensure effectiveness of the convergence.

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


- or broadly, the corresponding “survival” probability. The structure (2.1.1) allows us to focus on
the prosecution intensity, directly related to the likelihood, and it immediately implies that successful
prosecution is never guaranteed, which is also practical given the complex circumstances of each
insider trading case. Meanwhile, it is important to impose that λ _N_ (0) = 0, for, if the insider does not
trade at all, then there is no room for prosecution, while the increasing feature of λ _N_ signifies that
aggressive (insider) trading strategies necessarily result in a heightened probability of prosecution.
It is also crucial that the hazard rate (and thus the prosecution probability) explicitly depends on
the population size _N_, which is to incorporate the idea that the probability of identifying an insider
trader should decrease as the total number of normal traders increases. Indeed, a large number of
liquidity traders can create an elevated noise level, making it harder to distinguish abnormal trading
patterns from normal trading activity. Since the insider’s trades are usually detected as they represent
outliers in terms of order flow imbalances (DeMarzo, Fishman, and Hagerty (1998)), with an increasing number of liquidity trades, the threshold for what counts as a statistical outlier also rises, in turn
making it more challenging to detect his trades. The insider can then “camouflage” more easily, with
his suspicious behavior becoming less conspicuous. To examine the scale effect of _N_ on the insider’s
strategies, we impose a general power-type structure,


λ _N_ ( _z_ ) = λ( _N_ [−][β] _z_ ),


where λ ≡ λ1 is a _size-modulated_ hazard rate and β ≥ 0 is a power coefficient governing the scale.
As an important example, the probability of prosecution may be conceptualized as arising from
the sequential processes of abnormal order flow imbalance-triggered investigation and subsequent
successful legal actions, i.e.,




[1] 2 _z_ )P{| _W_ + _N_ [−] 2 [1]



p _N_ ( _z_ ) = _D_ ( _N_ [−] 2 [1]



2 _z_ | ≥ _y_ ¯}, (2.1.2)



where _D_ : R �→ [0, 1] is a size-modulated function satisfying that _D_ (0) = 0, representing the probability of prosecution conditional on investigation, and ¯ _y_ - 0 is a custom detection threshold. Then,
we have the following functional form for the hazard rate:


λ _N_ ( _z_ ) = − log(1 − p _N_ ( _z_ ))

where erfc(·) is the complementary Gauss error function; in this case, β = 1/2 exactly. Detailed
derivations are found in Supplemental Appendix B. In Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024), the prosecution probability is precisely p1 from (2.1.2), except with _D_ ∈ [0, 1] being a constant probability.
In general, the power coefficient β allows us to consider a flexible dependence structure of the
prosecution probability with respect to the aggregate noise level, which is crucial to examining its
impact on the behavior of the insider’s strategy _Z_ when the population size becomes large.


**2.2** **Composition of legal penalties**


Once successfully prosecuted, the insider trader is subject to legal penalties depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. First, a common component of insider trading


7


_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


penalties is _disgorgement_ of illicit profits, which involves the return of any profits gained from the illicit trading activity, ensuring unprofitability. The amount of disgorgement is usually calculated based
on the total profits earned by the insider, equaling ( _V_ - _P_ ) _Z_ ( _V_ ) upon revelation of the asset value.
Another notable aspect is the adoption of so-called “penalty multipliers,” which are imposed in
some cases as an enhancement of the deterrent effect of the penalties, based on factors such as the
egregiousness of the violation or the level of harm caused to investors or the market. For example,
in the U.S., the maximum civil penalty for insider trading is up to three times the profit gained or
loss avoided, a.k.a. the “treble damages” provision under the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud
Enforcement Act of 1988 (ITSFEA). Similarly, as amended by the ITSFEA, depending on evidence
of the insider’s level of intent and trading behavior, significant penalties can be triggered in criminal
cases to deter future misconduct; this includes prison sentences and steep fines – e.g., up to 20 years
and up to $5 million for individuals in the U.S.
With these factors in mind, we believe that a comprehensive model for legal penalties should
allow for explicit dependence on _both_ the insider trader’s illicit profit (as a civil penalty) and his
trading strategy (as a criminal penalty). Thus, it is desirable that a penalty function should be a
bivariate function of the insider’s trading strategy ( _z_ ) as well as his profit gained (( _v_ - _P_ ( _y_ )) _z_ ), taking
the general form _C_ ( _z_, ( _v_ - _P_ ( _y_ )) _z_ ). In the present paper, we focus on the below composition:

_C_ [�] _z_, ( _v_       - _P_ ( _y_ )) _z_ [�] = _C_ 0( _z_ ) + χ [�] ( _v_       - _P_ ( _y_ )) _z_ [�][+], _v_ ∈{0, 1}, (2.2.1)


where (·) [+] denotes the positive part. On the right side of (2.2.1), the first component with _C_ 0 incorporates **criminal penalties**, including imprisonment and fines, [12] that directly depends on the insider’s
trading strategy, while the second stands for **civil penalties** (with regard to the profit) controlled by a
**penalty multiplier** χ. For a meaningful consideration, we require _C_ 0( _z_ ) to be increasing (not necessarily strictly) in the magnitude of _z_, and it makes sense to force _C_ 0(0) = 0 in the case of no trading.
Additionally, we require that χ ≥ 1, which implies disgorgement of the insider’s illicit profit following successful prosecution. [13] Clearly, when χ = 1, only _C_ 0 will remain on top of disgorgement,
and penalization is largely strategy-based, while by taking _C_ 0 ≡ 0, the second component dominates,
leading to profit-based (civil) penalties.


**2.3** **Equilibrium definition**


With the aforementioned legal risk specifications, we now formulate the insider trader’s optimization
problem and give a formal definition of the equilibrium, for any population size _N_ of liquidity traders.
Accessing the value _V_ at time 0, the insider trader takes the price function _P_ from the market
maker as given and designs a trading strategy to maximize his expected net profit. His objective
function is given by




         - ~~√~~
_JN_ ( _P_ ; _z_, _v_ ) := E ( _v_ - _P_ (



~~√~~
_NW_ + _z_ )) _z_ - p _N_ ( _z_ ) _C_ [�] _z_, ( _v_ - _P_ (



_NW_ + _z_ )) _z_ [��], (2.3.1)



for _z_ ∈ R, _v_ ∈{0, 1}, which he seeks to maximize over _z_ for each value of _v_, namely _z_ = _Z_ ( _v_ ). At
the same time, given the insider’s trading strategy _Z_ = ( _Z_ (0), _Z_ (1)), the market maker observes the


12In the case of imprisonment, _C_ 0 can be considered equivalent to a capital penalty due to its severe, lifelong impact on
one’s economic, social, and personal “capital.” Such an impact could manifest as opportunity costs, social and economic
disconnection, lasting stigma, etc.
13This feature is also in keeping with the institutional parametric condition made in Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024)

**Definition 2.1.** _For any fixed N_ ≥ 1 _, an equilibrium is a couple_ ( _ZN_ [∗] [,] _[ P]_ [∗] _N_ [)] _[ of trading strategy and]_
_price function such that:_
_(i) Given P_ [∗] _N_ _[, the insider trader maximizes his expected net profit from trade (][2.3.1][), i.e.,]_


_JN_ ( _P_ [∗] _N_ [;] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ sup] _JN_ ( _P_ [∗] _N_ [;] _[ z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][,] _v_ ∈{0, 1}. (2.3.4)
_z_ ∈R


_(ii) Given ZN_ [∗] _[, the market maker sets a rational price function for break-even, namely]_


_P_ [∗] _N_ [(] _[y]_ [)][ =] _[ P][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [;] _[ y]_ [)][,] _y_ ∈ R.


According to condition (ii) above, for equilibrium analysis it is useful to rewrite the insider’s
objective function as
_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) := _JN_ ( _PN_ ( _Z_ ; ·); _z_, _v_ ),


where _Z_ can be viewed as the market maker’s target strategy. Since _V_ is supported on {0, 1}, from
(2.3.2) it is clear that 0 < _PN_ < 1. Then, in light of (2.2.1) and (2.3.1), regarding the profit maximization (2.3.4), the insider would rationally concentrate on sell strategies with _z_ ≤ 0 when _v_ = 0
and buy strategies with _z_ ≥ 0 when _v_ = 1; indeed, by abstaining from trading entirely ( _z_ = 0),
the investor guarantees a nonnegative net profit. However, a zero trading strategy is also trivial on
account of legal risk and is demonstrably suboptimal for the insider. [15] With this consideration in
mind, we may assume without loss of generality that the insider’s strategy satisfies the constraint
_Z_ = ( _Z_ (0), _Z_ (1)) ∈ (−∞, 0) × (0, ∞). As a result, the objective (2.3.4) is equivalent to



_J_ ´ _N_ ( _ZN_ [∗] [;] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ sup] _J_ ´ _N_ ( _ZN_ [∗] [;] _[ z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][,] with R _v_ :=
_z_ ∈R _v_



(−∞, 0), if _v_ = 0,
(2.3.5)
(0, ∞), if _v_ = 1.



14This can be justified by a Bertrand competition argument; see e ~~√~~ .g. Kyle (1985). An alternative interpretation is that the
market maker chooses _P_ to minimize the squared error E[( _V_ - _P_ ( _NW_ + _Z_ ( _V_ ))) [2] ].

15Under the key Assumption 4.1, it can be shown that a zero strategy cannot be optimal in equilibrium; see Step 1 in the
proof of Theorem 4.1 in Appendix B.

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


Besides, with _v_ ∈{0, 1} and 0 < _PN_ < 1, we have in (2.2.1) that

(( _v_            - _P_ ( _y_ )) _z_ ) [+] = ( _v_            - _P_ ( _y_ )) _z_ for all _z_ ∈ R _v_, and _P_ = _PN_ ( _Z_ ; ·). (2.3.6)


Then, recalling (2.3.1) and (2.2.1), we define the insider’s expected price, expected (gross) profit, and
expected additional penalties respectively as



~~√~~
Φ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_ ) := E [�] _PN_ ( _Z_ ;



_NW_ + _z_ ) [�], _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) := [�] _v_ - Φ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_ ) [�] _z_,



Ψ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) := _C_ 0( _z_ ) + (χ − 1) _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ), (2.3.7)


which allow us to recast the objective function (2.3.1) into the equivalent form


_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) = _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) − (1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] )Ψ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ), _z_ ∈ R _v_ . (2.3.8)


In particular, (2.3.3) shows that the function Φ _N_ is precisely the expected value of a Gaussian random
variable under a sigmoid-type transformation. [16]

### **3 Limiting equilibrium and convergence**


In exercising stealth trading, the insider trader has the tendency to trade in larger quantities compared
to a single liquidity trader, while his trade size cannot be “too large” at the same time in view of
the risk of detection and prosecution. We again refer to Frino _et al._ (2013) Sect. V.B, Meulbroek
(1992) Sect. E and Chakravarty (2001) for related empirical evidence. This suggests that an insider’s
optimal trading strategy should, ideally, scale with the total population size to adequately capture its
asymptotic behavior.
From a mathematical viewpoint, in the limit as _N_ goes to infinity, the optimal trading strategy _ZN_ [∗]
from Definition 2.1 can well be infinity. Since we consider power-law growth in the hazard rate, it is
reasonable to introduce the scaled strategy _Z_ [˜] _N_ [∗] [=] _[ N]_ [−][γ] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [for some (yet-to-be-determined) coe][ffi][cient]
γ ≥ 0, subject to the requirement that the limiting scaled strategy _Z_ [˜] γ [∗] [:][=][ lim] _[N]_ [→∞] _[Z]_ [˜] _N_ [∗] [exist with nonzero]
values in R0 × R1. In other words, we suspect the insider’s (original) strategy to have the property that
_ZN_ [∗] [∼] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][, i.e., lim] _[N]_ [→∞] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [)][/][(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [))][ =][ 1 for] _[ v]_ [ ∈{][0][,][ 1][}][, as] _[ N]_ [ →∞][. The coe][ffi][cient][ γ][ bears direct]
connections to the camouflage effect as it directly reflects the insider’s desire to balance his wealth
expected from illicit trading and his level of stealth to avoid detection and prosecution. A smaller
value is associated with a smaller chance of detection, or equivalently, a higher stealth level. In
particular, we formally name it the **stealth index** and, considering the aforementioned moderateness
of insider trade sizes, a desirable – but yet-to-be-verified – value range for this index will be (0, 1/2). [17]

Nevertheless, in what follows we shall still consider the general value range [0, ∞) ∋ γ.
To formalize the notion of a limiting equilibrium based on the scaled trading strategy, _Z_ [˜] = _N_ [−][γ] _Z_,
we need to consider the limit of the price function (2.3.3) as _N_ →∞. Since for _z_ at the scale of _N_ [γ],
√
_y_ = _NW_ + _z_ is at the scale of _N_ [max][{][γ,][1][/][2][}], we can introduce the scaled order flow ˜ _y_ = _N_ [−] [max][{][γ,][1][/][2][}] _y_

and re-parameterize the equilibrium price function in (2.3.2) and (2.3.3) as

_P_ ˜ [γ] _N_ [( ˜] _[Z]_ [; ˜] _[y]_ [)][ =] _[ P][N]_ [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜] _[Z]_ [;] _[ N]_ [max][{][γ,][1][/][2][}] _[y]_ [˜][)][,] _Z_ ˜ = ( ˜ _Z_ (0), ˜ _Z_ (1)) ∈ R0 × R1, _y_ ˜ ∈ R. (3.1)


16Despite no known closed form, it can be expressed in terms of an infinite series containing Gaussian moments and
explicitly computable coefficients by adopting an expansion argument.
17Clearly, γ = 0 would imply that the insider’s trade size is comparable to that of a single liquidity trader, while if
γ = 1/2, he would trade at the same scale as all the liquidity traders combined.

Throughout the paper, we use the tilde notation (˜) to indicate the scaled quantities. The next proposition shows that the corresponding limit generally depends on γ.

(3.2)



Proposition 3.1 demonstrates that for the interesting range γ ∈ (0, 1/2) of the stealth index, the
limiting price function no longer depends on the insider’s trading strategy and is, in particular, constant, equal to the expected value of _V_ . In the case γ = 1/2, as the insider trades at the scale of all
liquidity trades, the limit is, unsurprisingly, invariant to the population size _N_, which can be normalized to 1, as considered in the literature. The case γ > 1/2 points to an audacious insider trading
strategy, with volumes far exceeding typical aggregate levels, and the asset price is set in the usual
way (equal to _p_ ) when the market maker perceives no insider involvement, and is otherwise adjusted
to the extremal values (0 or 1), making detection and prosecution nearly inevitable (no stealth). This
observation suggests [0, 1/2] ∋ γ as a plausible range and is to be verified through equilibrium analysis.
The price limits in Proposition 3.1 allow to examine the corresponding limiting behaviors of
the expected price, profit, and penalties, Φ _N_, _QN_, and Ψ _N_ in equilibrium. However, simply analyzing
these limits appears to offer little insight into the correct choice of the stealth index γ from the insider’s
perspective. Instead, we shall re-scale the insider’s objective function (or expected net profit): Given
a price function _P_ [˜] on the scaled order flow ˜ _y_, we consider the following limiting scaled objective
function:
_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [) :][=][ lim] _N_ →∞ _[N]_ [−][γ] _[J][N]_ [(] _[P]_ [γ] _N_ [;] _[ N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜][,] _[ v]_ [)][,] _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_, _v_ ∈{0, 1}, (3.3)

where _JN_ is the original objective function in (2.3.8), and _P_ [γ] _N_ [(] _[y]_ [) :][=][ ˜] _[P]_ [(] _[N]_ [−] [max][{][γ,][1][/][2][}] _[y]_ [) is the recovered]
price function. On the right side of (3.3), _JN_ is scaled exactly by _N_ [−][γ] because based on (2.3.8), when
_P_ [γ]
_N_ [(] _[y]_ [)][ =] _[ P][N]_ [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜] _[Z]_ [;] _[ y]_ [), the expected price][ Φ] _[N]_ [ is bounded and the expected additional penalty][ Ψ] _[N]_ [ must]
be controlled not to blow up either. Hence, the limiting equilibrium paired with Definition 2.1 can
be defined with γ chosen such that the limiting objective function (3.3) is well-defined, and to ensure
that the effect of γ is meaningful, it is important to restrict attention to nonzero limiting strategies as
well as nonzero limiting objective function values.


**Definition 3.1.** _A_ γ _-limiting equilibrium is a couple_ ( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [)] _[ of scaled trading strategy and price]_

On paper, from the objective function forms (2.3.8) and (3.3), a sophisticated choice of the stealth
index γ should exhibit reliance on the growth rate of the size-modulated hazard rate λ, controlled


11


_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


by β ≥ 0, as well as that of the criminal penalty component _C_ 0, with respect to the insider’s trading strategy. [18] Intuitively, with light-to-moderate criminal penalties, the expected price Φ _N_ tends to
overshadow potential legal risk, prompting the insider to trade at larger scales and worry less about
being detected, thereby using a larger γ, while severe criminal penalties are likely to place a deterrent
effect on the trading behavior and yields a relatively small γ. Condition (ii) in Definition 3.1 also
reveals that if the insider trader exercises stealth trading with γ < 1/2, then in the limit of the population size _N_, the equilibrium price function becomes constant and _decoupled_ from the trading strategy
due to diminished price informativeness (see again Chakravarty (2001) and Kacperczyk and Pagnotta
(2024)). This decoupling feature significantly simplifies subsequent equilibrium analysis.
The above suggests that the exact structure of the penalty function _C_ plays an important role
in determining the correct stealth index with an increasing population size of liquidity traders. To
provide a thorough understanding of convergence towards the limiting equilibria, instead of providing
a balanced treatment of all penalty types, the following analysis concentrates on the predominant
scenario of civil penalties, which represents the most common enforcement outcome in insider trading
cases and matches the empirical nature of the data sets to be presented in Section 5. The examination
of scenarios involving criminal and mixed penalties is reserved for further discussions in Section 6,
also helping align with various cases considered in the literature (Carré, Collin-Dufresne, and Gabriel
(2022), Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024), and Çetin (2025)), apart from highlighting the technical
differences.

### **4 Predominant scenario: Civil penalties**


In the predominant scenario, upon successful prosecution, the insider trader faces civil penalties only
(as considered in Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024) Sect. 2). The penalties are imposed on his illicit
profit (( _V_ - _PN_ ) _Z_ ( _V_ )) through the penalty multiplier χ ≥ 1. In the absence of criminal charges, we
shall take _C_ 0 = 0 in (2.2.1).
Given a population size _N_ ≥ 1, the equilibrium objective function (2.3.8) reduces to


_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) = _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) − (1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] )Ψ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ )

= _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) − χ0(1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ) _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ), _z_ ∈ R _v_, (4.1)


where χ0 := χ − 1 ≥ 0 is the _disgorgement-adjusted_ penalty multiplier. Based on the expression
of _QN_ in (2.3.7), a notable feature of the civil penalties is their explicit dependence on the asset
value _v_ ∈{0, 1}, and the insider designs his trading strategies knowing that the total order flow ( _Y_ =
~~√~~

_NW_ + _Z_ ( _V_ )) observed by the market maker will automatically absorb uncertainty embedded in such
strategies.
On a closer look, the expected (additional) penalty Ψ _N_ in (4.1) can increase at most linearly with
the insider’s trade size (| _z_ |), since the expected price Φ _N_ is bounded, and more importantly, it is not a
monotone function of _z_, [19] which arises from a reduction in price informativeness that a significantly
larger number of trades placed by the insider inevitably shifts the total order flow towards revelation


18On the other hand, note that from (2.2.1), the civil penalty component is always of linear growth as | _z_ | →∞ due to the
boundedness of the price function _PN_ .
19This non-monotonicity property is what makes the structure of civil penalties inherently different from that of criminal
penalties – hence not regardable as a special instance of the latter; see Section 6.


12


_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


of the fundamental asset value ( _V_ ), thereby pushing the market maker to adjust the price closer to
this true value. This adjustment can then substantially reduce or even wipe out the insider’s profit,
leading to a smaller penalty (in addition to disgorgement). From another viewpoint, considering
that civil penalties are typically less severe than criminal penalties (reserved for serious violations),
if only civil penalties are in force, the insider is likely to trade large amounts, knowing that the
penalty might decrease as the profits diminish. [20] For this reason, sole reliance on profit-based civil
penalties may seem “overly idealistic” in that it fails to adequately address and penalize extremely
violent insider trading actions, as the absence of significant illicit profit should not absolve the insider
of his malicious behavior from the outset. This key observation further motivates a more general
consideration combining civil and criminal penalties, to be addressed in Section 6.
To precisely determine the stealth index γ, we make the following technical assumption on the
(size-modulated) hazard rate, which is also essential for establishing existence and uniqueness.


**Assumption 4.1.** _For v_ ∈{0, 1} _,_ λ _is continuously differentiable and convex (not necessarily_
_strictly) on_ R _v, with_ λ [′] < 0 _on_ (−∞, 0) _and_ λ [′] - 0 _on_ (0, ∞) _._


The requirement that λ be convex (apart from its strict increase) is nonrestrictive, which signifies
a growing inclination to detect and prosecute the insider trader as his trade size increases. This is,
for example, the case for the order flow imbalance-based detection mechanism (DeMarzo, Fishman,
and Hagerty (1998)): For (2.1.3) one can show that whenever _D_ ( _z_ ) = _KD_ | _z_ | [θ] _[D]_ for some _KD_ - 0 and
θ _D_ ≥ 1, then λ [′] is guaranteed to be increasing, and |λ [′] ( _z_ )| ≥ _K_ θ [′][|] _[z]_ [|][θ] _[D]_ [ for some] _[ K]_ θ [′] [>][ 0. Details are given]
in Supplemental Appendix B.
The following theorem, serving as the main result of this section, details the existence and uniqueness of the finite- _N_ equilibrium and the limiting equilibrium, along with the desired convergence.


**Theorem 4.1.** _Consider the setting of (4.1), and let Assumption 4.1 hold true. Then, we have the_
_following three assertions._

_(i) For every N_ ≥ 1 _, there exists an equilibrium_ ( _ZN_ [∗] [,] _[ P]_ [∗] _N_ [)] _[ in the sense of Definition][ 2.1][.]_
_(ii) There exists a_ γ _-limiting equilibrium in the sense of Definition 3.1 if and only if_

_there exists a constant K_ - 0 _, depending only on the model parameters but not on N, such that, for_

20From the proof of Theorem 4.1 we shall see that in the present scenario with only civil penalties, for every _N_ ≥ 1
and both _v_ ∈{0, 1}, Ψ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) → 0 as | _z_ | →∞, meaning that the insider can technically reduce the penalty to none by
increasing his trade size indefinitely.


13


_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


An immediate implication from the first two assertions is that Assumption 4.1 provides sufficient
conditions to ensure the existence of a finite- _N_ equilibrium and a limiting equilibrium, the latter also
being unique when γ < 1/2 – as is the interesting case with stealth trading. Technically, analyzing
the finite- _N_ equilibrium is significantly more involved than the limiting equilibrium and relies on a
key lemma (Lemma B.1 in Appendix B), which elucidates a fundamental property of the function
governing the insider’s expected (gross) profit. [21] Besides, according to (4.2), the stealth index γ
for the trading strategy is capped at 1/2, meaning that the insider deliberately refrains from overly
aggressive trading – at quantities exceeding the total orders – inevitably exposing himself.
Assertion (iii) from Theorem 4.1 expounds the convergence of any finite- _N_ equilibrium towards
the (unique) γ-limiting equilibrium, in terms of both the insider’s optimal strategy and the market
maker’s price function, on the assumption that γ < 1/2. For the price function, the rate of convergence, identified as the inverse power of _N_, is γ − 1/2 < 0, proportionate to the stealth index γ. The
intuition behind this is clear: As γ ↘ 0, the insider’s trade size, scaled to match that of a single
liquidity trader, becomes negligible within the total order flow, leaving the population size _N_ as the
dominant factor; conversely, as γ ↗ 1/2, the trade size effectively matches the entire population of
liquidity traders, nullifying the size impact, and convergence is out of question.
The convergence rate (2γ − 1) for the insider’s optimal strategies is proportionally related to how
the population size obscures investigation and prosecution, as measured by the coefficient β, and
stems directly from the convergence of the price function. An important regulatory insight from this
result is that the intensity of investigation (linked to β) can significantly impact how closely insiders’
trade sizes approach their limit associated with diminished price impact. More specifically, when
investigations are highly effective (β = 0) – nearly unaffected by the trading population – informed
traders’ strategies tend to converge rapidly for any given stealth level and are driven by the price
function’s behavior.
Pertaining to Definition 3.1, Theorem 4.1 further demonstrates that if γ happens to be less than
1/2, the limiting equilibrium price function becomes constant, decoupled from insider trading information, hence making itself much easier to analyze than that with a finite population, which is even
explicitly solvable in specific settings. We give the following illustrative example, which considers a quadratic hazard rate while adhering to the “treble damages” provision. The proof is given in
Supplemental Appendix B.


**Example 4.1.** _Let p_ ∈ (0, 1) _be arbitrary, and let_ λ( _z_ ) = _z_ [2] _(satisfying Assumption 4.1) and_ χ = 3 _._
_Suppose that_ γ = β ∈ [0, 1/2) _. Then, the_ γ _-limiting equilibrium is uniquely determined as_



12 [−] [W][0] ~~�~~ ~~[√]~~ 3 _e_ ~~�~~ [�] ≈ (−0.350753, 0.350753), _P_ ˜ [∗] γ [=] _[ p]_ [,] (4.5)




~~�~~
_Z_ ˜γ [∗] [=] - 



~~�~~

12 [−] [W][0] ~~�~~ ~~[√]~~ 3 _e_ ~~�~~,



_where_ W0(·) _denotes the Lambert_ W _function (a.k.a. the product logarithm)._


An interesting observation in Example 4.1 is that regardless of the probability _p_ of revealing
the asset value _V_ = 1, at equilibrium, the insider sticks to trading the same amount in both states
(| _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][|][ =][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1)). An explanation is that as the civil penalties are tied to the insider’s illicit profit, they]
can effectively remove his incentive to compare and exploit the price differences in the two states,
even though the contingent expected profits may still be different.


21Although this property inherently follows from the normal distribution of total liquidity order flow, it is in fact shared
by a broad class of log-concave distributions (including many infinitely divisible distributions); see Saumard and Wellner
(2014) and Yamazato (1978).

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


Following Theorem 4.1, the approximation power of the limiting equilibrium towards any finitepopulation equilibrium can be further illuminated with the concept of ϵ-equilibria, connected to Definition 3.1, which we show in Definition 4.1. [22]


**Definition 4.1.** _For any fixed N_ ≥ 1 _and_ ϵ ≥ 0 _, an_ ϵ _-equilibrium is a couple_ ( _Z_ [∗][,ϵ]

_strategy and price function such that, based on (2.3.3), (3.1), and (3.3),_


_N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _P_ [∗] _N_ [,ϵ][;] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗][,ϵ][(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ ≥] [sup] _N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _P_ [∗] _N_ [,ϵ][;] _[ z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ −] [ϵ,] _v_ ∈{0, 1}, (4.6)

We have the next important result about the approximation of any finite-population equilibrium
via an arbitrary limiting equilibrium, with no uniqueness required.

Theorem 4.2 asserts that any limiting equilibrium defined under Definition 3.1 automatically qualifies as an ϵ _N_ -equilibrium within the actual, finitely populated market, for which the magnitude of ϵ _N_,
as a function of the population size _N_, carries the same economic implications in terms of the stealth
index γ as the equilibrium strategies. The statement highlights the central idea that the limiting equilibrium is a practical and robust approximation across a wide range of detection schemes, whenever
the population of liquidity traders is justifiably large enough.

### **5 Empirical perspectives**


In this section, we address the issue of estimating the population size of liquidity traders, _N_, and the
stealth index γ, using available data on insider trading cases. The main idea of this empirical analysis,
as mentioned in Section 1, is to verify that the population of liquidity traders is, as expected, considerably large for any generic risky asset and – more importantly – that insiders favor trading with medium
intensity (compared to all liquidity traders present in the same trading episodes) in the presence of
legal risk by adopting a moderate stealth level, therefore confirming the deterrent effect of legal risk
on insiders’ trade size choices, associated with diminished price informativeness (as implied from the
convergence properties in Section 3); see, again, Barclay and Warner (1993), Chakravarty (2001), and
Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024). We conduct the analysis with two calibration experiments, which
rely on different calibration conditions and yet confirm the same phenomena of interest.


22Generally speaking, the convergence of non-unique equilibria in stronger senses (e.g., with respect to the Hausdorff distance) cannot be established without imposing additional technical conditions. A thorough exploration of this convergence
issue in the insider trading context is left for further research.

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


**5.1** **Calibration experiment I**


Our first calibration experiment makes use of insider trading volume data collected and analyzed in
one of the earliest financial studies of its kind, conducted by Meulbroek (1992). Specifically, the data
set consists of a list of 320 defendants formally charged with insider trading by the SEC in civil or
administrative cases from 1980 to 1989, with the (daily) trading volumes for these defendants sourced
from (both public and non-public) SEC documents, along with the target firms’ total trading volumes
on the days of insider trading (sourced from Iterative Data Services’ Investment Statistical Listing
Tapes and from S&P’s Daily Stock Price Record). [23]

Table 1 summarizes useful statistics for this data set, extracted from Meulbreuk (1992) Sect. III.E.
It is worth mentioning that the data set only covers detected insider trading violations (as reported to
the SEC), and the volumes are precisely those traded by the defendants (who have been detected and
prosecuted), while much insider trading remains undetected over the observation period. On average,
the (detected) insider trading volume constitutes about 8% of the total volume, both in terms of shares
traded and dollar value, and so we shall utilize the share volume statistics exclusively.


Table 1: Statistics for (daily) insider trading volume data (1980–1989)
(Source: Meulbroek (1992))


Average insider share volume 9,819
Average insider dollar volume $300,023
Average total share volume 113,909
Standard error for average total share volume 10,246
Average total dollar volume $4,121,533
Standard error for average total dollar volume $594,327
Median insider-to-total volume ratio 11.3%


Under the equilibrium model framework, we adopt a _method-of-moment_ -type estimation approach, which starts by deriving the theoretical counterparts of the statistics in Table 1 as functions
of _N_ and γ, and then setting them to be equal to the sample statistics, respectively, on the assumption
that the underlying economy is in equilibrium. It is hence understood that the (single) insider trader
in our model acts as a _representative agent_ of insider trading during any insider trading episode, with
_N_ tracking the relative size of liquidity (non-inside or normal) traders compared to insiders. Also, as
only defendants formally charged with insider trading are included in the data set, the statistics must
be interpreted as conditional on prosecution – the reported average insider volumes exclude undetected or unprosecuted cases and unequivocally underestimate the actual insider trading volumes.
The theoretical counterparts of the above statistics are tractable to compute within the model
by appealing to the approximate normality in the effect of large _N_, as discussed below; detailed
derivations are in Supplemental Appendix B. Recall that _BN_ is the (independent) Bernoulli random
variable representing the prosecution mechanism (see (2.1.1)). Then, given the insider’s strategy _Z_,
the estimated prosecution probability is



P [�] _BN_ ( _Z_ ( _V_ )) = 1 [�] =

found in Meulbroek (1992) Tab. I.

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


The average insider trading volume (in shares) corresponds to the conditional expectation of the
(representative) insider’s trade size upon successful prosecution, namely


�1
E�| _Z_ ( _V_ )|��� _BN_ ( _Z_ ( _V_ )) = 1� = _v_ ~~�~~ =01 _[p]_ [(] _[v]_ [)][|] _[Z]_ [(] _[v]_ [)][|][�][1][ −] _[e]_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [(] _[v]_ [))][�] . (5.1.2)

_v_ =0 _[p]_ [(] _[v]_ [)] ~~[�]~~ [1][ −] _[e]_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [(] _[v]_ [))] ~~[�]~~


To construct a meaningful match for the average total volume (in shares), let us recall that according to the model framework (Section 2), all the liquidity traders place independent orders, each
with zero mean and variance σ [2] . Assuming that such orders are successfully filled, a reasonable
proxy for the total liquidity volume is then the absolute sum of these independent random variables,
and by the central limit theorem again, this sum can be approximated by a normal random variable
_XN_ =d. Normal( _N_ µ, _N_ (σ2 − µ2)) for some parameter µ > 0 (again, under the large- _N_ assumption).24

This coefficient, which depends on the exact trade distribution of an average liquidity trader, is yet to
be determined, while for now we take it as given. Hence, the average total volume (in shares) should
be matched to


�1
E� _XN_ + | _Z_ ( _V_ )|��� _BN_ ( _Z_ ( _V_ )) = 1� = _N_ µ + _v_ ~~�~~ =01 _[p]_ [(] _[v]_ [)][|] _[Z]_ [(] _[v]_ [)][|][�][1][ −] _[e]_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [(] _[v]_ [))][�] . (5.1.3)

For the insider-to-total volume ratio, it is more convenient to consider its reciprocal (“total-toinsider volume ratio”), whose conditional tail distribution function on prosecution is given by

2 _N_ σ [2]



Since the data set focuses on civil cases with pecuniary charges only, we follow the setting of
Example 4.1 to design our calibration experiment (with γ = β). Assuming market efficiency, we fix
the probability of revealing the upstate ( _V_ = 1) at _p_ = 1/2. The consideration of a quadratic (sizemodulated) hazard rate λ( _z_ ) = _Kz_ [2], _z_ ∈ R, for some _K_ - 0, agrees with the tail behaviors of (2.1.3)
for abnormal order flow imbalance-based detection and can be seen as a reasonable approximation
of the latter, and we have further _K_ = 1/(2σ [2] ); see Supplemental Appendix B for details. For civil
penalties, we emphasize the “treble damages” provision again by testing three values of the penalty
multiplier: χ ∈{1, 2, 3} (or χ0 ∈{0, 1, 2}).
If _N_ happens to be large, then according to assertion (iii) in Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2, we can
take the re-scaled limiting equilibrium ( _N_ [γ][ ˜] _Z_ γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [) as a reasonable approximation for the actual (finite-]
_N_ ) equilibrium ( _ZN_ [∗] [,] _[ P]_ [∗] _N_ [). This implicit assumption can be verified posteriorly after the calibration.]
In the limiting case, with the above specified parameters, by following Example 4.1 we obtain the
following insider trading strategy at equilibrium:




~~�~~



( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][,][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1))][ =][ (][−][σ][ ×][ a][, σ][ ×][ a][)][,] with a =

which is proportional to σ, i.e., the trade size of an average liquidity trader, with a constant limiting
price function _P_ [˜] [∗] γ [=][ 1][/][2.]


24As each liquid ~~√~~ ity trader places an order ξ _i_, _i_ = 1, . . ., _N_, i.i.d. with zero mean and variance σ2, the total liquidity order
flow is [�] _i_ _[N]_ =1 [ξ] _[i]_ [ ≈] _NW_ (assuming that _N_ is large), while the total liquidity volume is approximated as [�] _i_ _[N]_ =1 [|][ξ] _[i]_ [|][ =] _[ X][N]_ [. Also,]

with E[|ξ1|] = µ, we have Var(|ξ1|) = E[ξ1 [2][]][ −] [E][[][|][ξ][1][|][]][2][ =][ σ][2][ −] [µ][2][.]


17


_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


Next, we make the substitution _Z_ = _N_ [γ][ ˜] _Z_ γ [∗] [from (][5.1.5][) in (][5.1.2][), (][5.1.3][), and (][5.1.4][), and then]
establish three calibration conditions by equating (5.1.2) and (5.1.3) to the numbers 9819 and 113909,
respectively, and setting (5.1.4) to be equal to 1/2 for _x_ = 1/11.3%. However, it turns out that under
(5.1.5), these conditions are not able to determine the values of _N_ and σ simultaneously, because the
latter is inherently a scaling factor for the total order flow. Instead, since _N_ and σ clearly exhibit
an inverse relationship, it is always possible to obtain a lower bound estimate for _N_ by imposing
an upper bound on σ. In accordance with the standard 100 round lot in the U.S. as well as the
phenomenon of trade-size clustering (Alexander and Peterson (2007)), we set σ = 1000, which is
a conservative enough estimate in this context given the (daily) average price around $36.18 traded
during the observation period – amounting to $36,180 worth of trades placed per trader each day.
Using smaller values of σ will necessarily lead to _N_ increasing, to which the value of γ (as a power
coefficient) is also resistant.
In addition, while the additional parameter µ > 0 may be determined in several ways, we prefer
to take on a direct approach leveraging the standard deviation of the total volume in the same data
set, estimated to be 248,452; again, see Supplemental Appendix B for details. By equating the standard deviation of _XN_, or ~~�~~ _N_ (σ [2] - µ [2] ), to this value and using the calibration condition from (5.1.3),

we arrive at an estimate ˆµ ≈ 1.68625. [25] This estimate is in keeping with the significant asymmetric
and leptokurtic feature of trading volumes, which is a well-documented phenomenon in market microstructure; see, e.g., Mike and Farmer (2008) and Çetin and Waelbroeck (2024). [26] In particular,
at the individual level, the average trading volume is exceeded substantially by its standard deviation
(σ) in value, the relative smallness persisting with smaller values of σ. Then, by setting µ = 1.68625
and σ = 1000, we continue to solve exactly two calibration conditions at a time and compare the
parameter estimates ( _N_ [ˆ], ˆγ). Results are reported in Table 2.


Table 2: Results on calibration experiment I

χ = 3 (61729, 0.270651) (45708, 0.27823) (59918, 0.295992)



Table 2 shows that estimates for the stealth index γ are quite robust when using different calibration conditions, standing around 0.25, strictly lying between 0 and 0.5 as expected. These values
represent a moderate stealth level and suggests that over the observation period, an insider tends to
trade at significantly smaller scales than the entire population of liquidity traders while transcending
an average liquidity trader. In the case χ = 2, for instance, by noting that 15 < _N_ [ˆ] [γ][ˆ] < 21, while
213 < - _N_ ˆ < 249, the insider trade size is roughly 17 times larger than a liquidity trade size, albeit 13

times smaller than the size of all trades combined. This observation is in line with a key conclusion of
Meulbroek (1992) that in spite of abnormal volumes on insider trading days, the insider trading vol

25The estimate is numerically stable – using the more complex conditions (5.1.2) or (5.1.4) instead of (5.1.3) produces
similar values in the range [1, 2], and so for succinctness we stick with this estimate.
26This phenomenon indicates that while many trading episodes carry small or no trades, a few episodes contain very
large trades, which also closely reflects the aforementioned trade size clustering (e.g., Chang, Pinegar, and Schachter
(1997), Alexander and Peterson (2007), and Fei and Xia (2024)). Notably, the heavy-tailed behavior does not conflict with
the approximate-normality treatment for the present analysis, as the stated statistics are not tail-dependent and thus robust;
indeed, replacing normality with a heavy-tailed distribution for _XN_ yields virtually no change to the results to follow.

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


ume only makes up a small portion of the total. The (lower bound) estimates for the population size
_N_ exhibit slightly larger variations across conditions but stand at a scale of 10 [4] ≫ 30 (see Footnote
11), and the equilibrium model estimates that, on average, one insider trade is present for (at least)
approximately every 50,000 non-insider trades over the same trading episodes.
One seemingly counterintuitive observation is that the estimate for γ exhibits an increasing trend
with respect to the penalty multiplier χ. While one might well expect heightened penalties to deter insider activity and thus reduce γ, this result is actually consistent with the calibration approach. As the
calibration works by fixing the sample statistics and deriving implied model parameters, achieving the
same insider trade size under stricter penalties necessitates more aggressive insider trading behavior.
As such, Table 2 should not be interpreted as a guide for designing optimal penalty multipliers.
We proceed to solve the finite-population equilibrium (existent) with the values of _N_ [ˆ] in Table 2
to check its closeness to the limiting equilibrium employed for the calibration, for which purpose
we employ a _fixed-point algorithm_ developed according to the equilibrium conditions in (B.11) and
(B.14) in Appendix B. For a concise presentation, we concentrate on the case χ = 3, with the resulting
equilibrium objects presented in Table 3 and Figure 1 below – results in the cases χ = 1 and χ = 2 are
substantially no different. Clearly, the finite- _N_ [ˆ] equilibrium objects are all very close to their limiting
counterparts, verifying the validity of the approximation ( _ZN_ [∗] [,] _[ P]_ [∗] _N_ [)][ ≈] [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [) in the outset. From]
Theorem 4.1, the rate of equilibrium convergence is proportionate to the stealth index γ.

**5.2** **Calibration experiment II**


In the second calibration experiment, we leverage available data from two recent studies, Kacperczyk
and Pagnotta (2024) and Patel and Putn, inš (2021), on legal risk in insider trading. First, using a
data set of 530 insider trading cases prosecuted by the SEC between 1995 and 2018, Kacperczyk
and Pagnotta (2024) constructed two key empirical proxies: the total dollar volume traded by the


19


_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


insider over a trading episode (in units of days) (denoted as [�] Bet therein) and the corresponding (daily)
insider-to-total volume ratio ( [�] BetNorm), the latter serving to provide a clearer indication of the market
impact of insider trades. For these calculations, the total dollar volume represents the average daily
dollar volume traded for the corresponding assets over the prior calendar year. Second, Patel and
Putn, inš (2021) constructed a data set spanning the period from 1996 to 2016 and utilized a two-stage
detection-controlled estimation method to derive contemporaneous estimates for the probability of
detection and prosecution of insider trading across different corporate events. Thus, these two data
sets cover observation periods that are considerably close in range. [27]

We summarize some useful statistics for the calibration in Table 4. [28] The two statistics are gleaned
from Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024) Tab. III & Fig. IA.5.
The idea of the calibration is in principle identical to that of experiment I. In the setting of Example
4.1, we set _p_ = 1/2 and consider three penalty multiplier values χ ∈{1, 2, 3} for experimentation,
along with a quadratic hazard rate λ( _z_ ) = _z_ [2] /(2σ [2] ). [29] In this case, the limiting equilibrium strategy
_Z_ ˜γ [∗] [is as given in (][5.1.5][), with ˜] _[P]_ γ [∗] [=][ 1][/][2.]


Table 4: Statistics for insider trading volume data (1995–2018)
(Source: Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024))


Median insider volume 4,900
Median insider-to-total volume ratio 2.6%


On the assumption that _N_ ≫ 1, according to Table 4, we can match (5.1.2) to the number 4900
and equate (5.1.4) to 1/2 for _x_ = 1/2.6% in order to form two calibration conditions. Indeed, in Table
4, we use the median insider volume instead of the average because the insider volume distribution
over these observation periods is severely right-skewed and fat-tailed; the theoretical counterpart can
still be represented by the conditional expectation (5.1.2), as the sample median converges to this
d.
value asymptotically given that _V_ = Bernoulli(1/2). For the trade size of an average liquidity trader,
we stick to the previous values, namely µ = 1.68625 and σ = 1000, in order to obtain a comparable
conservative lower bound estimate for _N_ . As before, the insider volume data over the observation
periods should be interpreted as being conditional on prosecution. The theoretical counterpart of the
prosecution probability is given by (5.1.1). However, upon applying _Z_ = _N_ [γ][ ˜] _Z_ γ [∗] [(with][ γ][ =][ β][), the]
expression in (5.1.1) is not a function of the variables _N_ and γ but can be used for later verifying the
functional form of the hazard rate. Table 5 summarizes the calibration results in this experiment.

27For more details regarding the two data sets we refer to Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024) Tab. I and Patel and Putn, inš
(2021) Sect. 2, respectively.
28Although Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024) primarily focuses on dollar volume, for adequate comparison (with calibration experiment I) we still use share volume statistics.
29The equilibrium simulation in Kacperczyk and Pagnotta (2024) is conducted in a very similar setting, with a binary
asset value _V_ with range equal to 1 and _p_ = 1/2. The (size-modulated) hazard rate λ1 from (2.1.3) can be reasonably
approximated by the quadratic hazard rate.

Figure 2: Comparison of equilibrium price function in calibration experiment II (χ = 3)


We see that based on statistics from this non-overlapping new observation period (1995–2018),
the stealth index γ is again estimated to strictly lie within the interval (0, 0.5), as expected, though the
estimates suggest a somewhat higher stealth level compared to the estimates from the first experiment
covering a pre-1990 period. This could indicate gradually increased prudence among insiders after
2000, likely in response to enhanced regulatory measures (such as increased regulatory budgets and
the introduction of the SEC Whistleblower Program), which also agrees with the increasing trends of
the prosecution probability as discussed in Patel and Putn, inš (2021) Sect. 4.3. In addition, the implied
lower bound of the population size, _N_ [ˆ], turns out to be larger than those from the first experiment (Table
2), standing at the 10 [5] scale.
As before, we compute the finite-population equilibrium (existent) using the estimates ( _N_ [ˆ], ˆγ) from
Table 5 to justify the validity of employing the limiting equilibrium; again, we only illustrate the case
χ = 3. Table 6 and Figure 2 verify the closeness between the equilibrium objects, respectively. In the
last column, the model-implied prosecution probabilities are computed by plugging the equilibrium
strategy values into (5.1.1), and notably, are at a comparable level to the average detection rate of
15% reported by Patel and Putn, inš (2021) Sect. 2, a key conclusion of their study (with data range
1996–2016). [30] This observation also empirically validates the quadratic form of the hazard rate.

### **6 Further discussions: Criminal and mixed penalties**


In this section, we discuss the general scenario where criminal charges are within consideration. Suppose that on successful prosecution, besides losing all of his illicit profit, the insider trader faces a
mixture of both civil and criminal penalties. While civil penalties are calculated with penalty multipliers applied to the insider’s illicit profit as before, criminal penalties are determined based on his


30The implied values both fall within the 95% confidence interval for the average detection rate for insider trading ahead
of earnings announcements; see Patel and Putn, inš (2021) Sect. 4.2.


21


_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


realized trading strategy ( _Z_ ). Therefore, we are looking at the general form (2.2.1) of the penalty
function.
For any population size _N_ ≥ 1, the insider’s objective function is given by (2.3.8) in equilibrium,
which is detailed as, for _v_ ∈{0, 1} and _z_ ∈ R _v_,


_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) = _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) − (1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ) [�] _C_ 0( _z_ ) + χ0 _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) [�] . (6.1)


Recall that χ0 = χ − 1 is the adjusted penalty multiplier, and _QN_ denotes the insider’s expected profit
in (2.3.7). The last term in (6.1) shows the total penalty besides disgorgement, reflecting a balanced
mechanism that accounts for both the insider’s malicious intent in engaging in illicit trading and
his realized profit, without either directly offsetting the other. We emphasize that under the general
form (2.2.1), any leniency or discretion exercised by the regulator can be incorporated through the
functional form of the criminal penalty function ( _C_ 0) or the penalty multiplier (χ0) governing civil
penalties, and so the approach by adding both types of penalties is sufficiently general from a practical
standpoint as well.
By setting the penalty multiplier χ = 1 in the structure (2.2.1), we come to a situation where the
insider faces criminal penalties exclusively on top of disgorgement. Then, with χ0 = 0, (6.1) becomes


_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) = _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) − (1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ) _C_ 0( _z_ ), _z_ ∈ R _v_, _v_ ∈{0, 1}. (6.2)


A comparison between (6.2) and (4.1) shows that, different from the predominant scenario involving
civil penalties only, the penalty function _C_ 0 has no explicit dependence on the asset value _v_ ∈{0, 1},
focusing instead on the insider’s trading behavior for a specific asset value – and not that in the alternative situation, e.g., through the price function _PN_ (or the general form of Ψ _N_ ). This is reasonable,
as in criminal cases, insider trading behavior is assessed based on the realized asset value (to which
the insider has prior access), rather than evaluated in hypothetical situations (Picardo (2022)). The
insider is also aware that penalties necessarily increase with his actual trading activity, governed by
the monotonicity of the penalty function _C_ 0.
As noted earlier, the asymptotic growth of _C_ 0 should be decisive of the asymptotic behaviors of
the trading strategies. This leads to the following conditions in addition to Assumption 4.1.


**Assumption 6.1.** _The following three conditions hold._


_(i) For v_ ∈{0, 1} _, both_ λ _and C_ 0 _are continuously differentiable and convex (not necessarily strictly)_

_C_ 0( _z_ ) = _K_ α| _z_ | [α] (1 + _o_ (1)), _C_ 0 [′] [(] _[z]_ [)][ =] _[ K]_ [α][α] _[z]_ [|] _[z]_ [|][α][−][2][ +] _[ O]_ [(][|] _[z]_ [|][α][−][1][−][α][′][)][,] _as_ | _z_ | →∞. (6.4)


31Given the convexity of λ, an application of the monotone density theorem (see, e.g., Bingham, Goldie, and Teugels
(1989)) ensures that λ [′] ( _z_ ) = _K_ θθ _z_ | _z_ | [θ][−][2] if λ( _z_ ) ∼ _K_ θ| _z_ | [θ], both as | _z_ | ↘ 0; however, there are no direct implications for the
asymptotic behavior of the remainder (λ [′] ( _z_ ) − _K_ θθ _z_ | _z_ | [θ][−][2] ), hence the imposition of (6.3).

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


Since the choice of the penalty function is entirely up to the regulator, it is customizable and
can be adjusted flexibly on a case-by-case basis. By contrast, the small argument behavior assumption regarding the hazard rate is natural and covers abnormal order flow imbalance-based detection
(DeMarzo, Fishman, and Hagerty (1998)). For example, in (2.1.3), since the sum of the two complementary error functions is asymptotically equivalent to _z_ [2] as | _z_ | ↘ 0, we have that θ = min{θ _D_, 2}
if _D_ ( _z_ ) ∼ _KD_ | _z_ | [θ] _[D]_ as | _z_ | ↘ 0 for _KD_ - 0 and θ _D_ ≥ 1; details are in Supplemental Appendix B. The
value of α is likely inversely related to γ, and in fact, the assumption on λ is only dominant when
α becomes “sufficiently large,” as the insider will judiciously reduce the prosecution probability so
as to offset the fast-growing (additional) penalty term in (6.2). Thus, Assumption 6.1 includes small
arguments because the scaled quantity _N_ [−][β] _z_ can still be small (as _N_ →∞) even if _z_ is large.
Under Assumption 6.1, we are able to extrapolate the main results in the predominant scenario
(Section 4 Theorem 4.1) to the present general scenario concerning both civil and criminal penalties.
In particular, a finite-population equilibrium ( _ZN_ [∗] [,] _[ P]_ [∗] _N_ [) in the sense of Definition][ 2.1][ continues to]
exist; see Supplemental Appendix A for details. Most striking is the existence of a unique γ-limiting
equilibrium ( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [) in the sense of Definition][ 3.1][, which is also unique when][ γ <][ 1][/][2; in particular,]
(4.2) is to be replaced by the more elaborate condition

γ = min [1]
θ + α − 1 [,] 2



�. (6.5)



Based on (6.5), the stealth index still has the upper bound 1/2, while it further exhibits a clear inverse
relationship with α. If α = 1, the insider trader views the criminal penalties as relatively minor
and simply chooses γ = min{β, 1/2}, based entirely on the scale effect from λ (equivalently, the
prosecution probability), as in (4.2); in this case, the small argument behavior of λ (namely θ) plays
no role. Conversely, as α exceeds 1, indicating severe criminal penalties, the insider begins to place
greater weight on the consequences of prosecution and, accordingly, trades less aggressively with a
smaller value γ < β. These results are formally stated in Theorem SA.1 in Supplemental Appendix
A, along with the corresponding convergence rates that are jointly determined by all the coefficients
β, θ, α, θ [′], and α [′] .
We give the following illustrative example to highlight the analytical simplicity of the limiting
equilibrium.


**Example 6.1.** _Let p_ = 1/3 _,_ λ( _z_ ) = _C_ 0( _z_ ) = | _z_ | _, and_ χ = 1 _, which satisfy Assumption 6.1, with_
θ = α = 1 _. Suppose that_ β ∈ [0, 1/2) _, so that_ γ = β < 1/2 _. Then, with the Lambert_ W _function_ W0 _,_
_the_ γ _-limiting equilibrium is uniquely determined as_



_Z_ ˜γ [∗] [≡] [( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][,][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1))][ =] �W0� 34 _e_



5 _e_ - [�] ≈ (−0.138547, 0.23844), _P_ ˜ [∗] γ [=] [1] 3



4 _e_ - - 1, 1 − W0� 35 _e_




[1]

3 [.]



In Example 6.1, the (size-modulated) hazard rate and the criminal penalty function are both perfectly proportional to the insider’s trading quantities, and the stealth index γ does not alter the form
of the limiting equilibrium (Definition 3.1), while only affecting the convergence rate of the finitepopulation equilibrium (Theorem SA.1 assertion (iii)) – through the scaled equilibrium strategy _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][.]
With the asset value _V_ more likely revealed to be 0 than 1 ( _p_ < 1/2), at equilibrium the insider also
tends to trade more if _V_ = 1 (with _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][(1)][ >][ |] _[Z]_ [ ˜] γ [∗][(0)][|][) to exploit the price di][ff][erence, which behavior]
differs fundamentally from what we have seen in Example 4.1 involving only civil penalties. From
the regulator’s viewpoint, this fundamental difference speaks to a crucial benefit of retaining criminal penalties: to prosecute based on the intent of illicit trading – a factor that can exhibit significant
asymmetry across different realizations (see, e.g., Öberg (2014)).

The next example shows that if the convexity conditions in Assumption 6.1 are violated, then the
uniqueness of the limiting equilibrium is not guaranteed.

Example 6.2 illustrates an extreme case where the prosecution mechanism is considerably weak
and ineffective, with the maximum penalty capped, leading to little-to-zero deterrent effect on insider
trading. Consequently, the insider’s optimal strategies can involve unboundedly large trade sizes as
the population of liquidity traders grows.

### **7 Conclusions**


This paper has introduced a Kyle-type model for insider trading with legal risk featuring a flexible
scheme of legal detection and penalty and the presence of a large liquidity trading crowd. Besides
justifying the normal distribution of liquidity trade sizes, the population size _N_ of liquidity traders has
spawned a series of limiting equilibria that provide a profound understanding of the camouflage effect
in insider trading, particularly uncovering insiders’ choices of trading scales when taking advantage
of the surrounding trading masses in avoidance of detection. These trading scales are quantified by the
stealth index γ, which is heavily associated with the population size over concurrent trading episodes.
The equilibrium analysis covering various types of penalty functions has shown that the stealth
index implied by insiders’ trading behavior is largely dependent on the mechanisms of detection as
well as the imposition of penalties from regulators’ side (Picardo (2022)). In particular, if only civil
penalties are imposed – based on illicit profit from trade – then in equilibrium, insiders choose the
stealth index solely based on the scale effect from the perceived probability of prosecution (see (4.2)),
as long as the resulting trade size does not reach the level of the combined activity of all liquidity
traders. On the other hand, when severe criminal penalties are devised (with α > 1), insiders are
prone to adopting an elevated stealth level (see (6.5)) compared to what the underlying detection
mechanism implies. This striking disparity highlights the importance of reserving criminal sanctions
in insider trading cases, due to their effectiveness in deterring illicit trading driven by a highly strategic
intent such as market abuse (Öberg (2014) and Dalko and Wang (2016)).
On a technical level, the proven equilibrium convergence properties (Theorem 4.2 and assertions
(iii) in Theorems 4.1 and SA.1) convey a key message that employing a limiting equilibrium significantly enhances the ease of analysis without altering the equilibrium’s fundamental implications. The


24

empirical perspectives in Section 5 further demonstrate the ease of equilibrium calibration to insider
trading volume data and confirm the prevalence of stealth trading amid sizeable normal trading activity, revealing a moderate stealth level in insider trading (Barclay and Warner (1993) and Chakravarty
(2001)) accompanied by a significant reduction in price informativeness (Kacperczyk and Pagnotta
(2024)) – hence conforming to the camouflage effect.

which tends to 0 as _N_ →∞. Thus, (A.1) becomes lim _N_ →∞ _P_ [˜] [γ] _N_ [( ˜] _[Z]_ [; ˜] _[y]_ [)][ =][ 1][/][(1][ +] _[ q]_ [)][ =] _[ p]_ [.]
Second, if γ = 1/2, the terms involving _N_ cancel out, and we have for (A.1) that _P_ [˜] [γ]

while if 2˜ _y_ - _z_ ˜0 − _z_ ˜1 < 0, the exponent ˜κ _N_ (˜ _y_ ) goes to ∞, yielding that _P_ [˜] [γ] _N_ [( ˜] _[Z]_ [; ˜] _[y]_ [)][ →] [0.]
Summarizing the three cases, we have verified the limit expressions in (3.2).   
### **Appendix B Proof of Theorem 4.1**


We start with the following lemma that governs the log-concavity property of the insider’s expected
profit function.


**Lemma B.1.** _For any given N_ ≥ 1 _, Z_ = ( _Z_ (0), _Z_ (1)) ∈ R0 × R1 _, and v_ ∈{0, 1} _, the function_
_QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) _in_ (2.3.7) _is strictly log-concave in z_ ∈ R _v, i.e.,_ log _QN_ ( _Z_ ; ·, _v_ ) _is a strictly concave function_
_on_ R _v._


**Proof.** Let _N_ ≥ 1 and _Z_ = ( _Z_ (0), _Z_ (1)) ∈ R0 × R1 be fixed. We first consider the case _v_ = 0, with
_z_ < 0. By (2.3.3), we write succinctly

_PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ) = (B.1)

1 + _e_ _[ay]_ [+] _[b]_




[−] _[Z]_ [(1)] < 0, _b_ := log _q_ + _[Z]_ [(1)][2][−] _[Z]_ [(0)][2]

where _a_ := _[Z]_ [(0)][−] _[Z]_ [(1)]

[2]



.
2 _N_ σ [2]



Then, log _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ) = − log [�] 1 + _e_ _[ay]_ [+] _[b]_ [�], and so



∂ _y_ log _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ) = − _[ae][ay]_ [+] _[b]_




_[ae][ay]_ [+] _[b]_ [=][ −] _[a]_ [ +] _a_ [,] ∂ _yy_ log _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ) = − _a_ [2] _e_ _[ay]_ [+] _[b]_

which show that _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ) is strictly log-concave in _y_ . Also, note that

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


Since it is well-known that the Gaussian distribution is log-concave, in the sense that the density
function _e_ [−] _[x]_ [2][/][(2][σ][2][)][�] ~~[√]~~ 2πσ [2] is log-concave in _x_ ∈ R, an application of the Prékopa–Leindler theorem

(see, e.g., Brascamp and Lieb (1976)) yields that Φ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_ ) in (B.2) is log-concave in _z_ . Note further
that, for _v_ = 0 and _z_ < 0, we have


log _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) = log(− _z_ ) + log Φ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_ ).


Then, by the (strict) concavity of the logarithm, we see that _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) is (strictly) log-concave in
_z_ < 0.
Next, consider the case _v_ = 1 and _z_   - 0, with


log _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 1) = log _z_ + log [�] 1 − Φ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_ ) [�], (B.3)


and 1 - _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ) = _e_ _[ay]_ [+] _[b]_ /(1 + _e_ _[ay]_ [+] _[b]_ ) = _e_ _[ay]_ [+] _[b]_ _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ), and so log(1 - _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ )) = _ay_ + _b_ + log _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ).
The log-concavity of 1 − _PN_ ( _Z_ ; _y_ ) in _y_, along with the Prékopa–Leindler theorem again, implies that
1 − Φ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_ ) is log-concave in _z_ . It then follows from (B.3) that _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 1) is (strictly) log-concave
in _z_ - 0 as well. 

**Proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (i).** Consider the finite- _N_ equilibrium in Definition 2.1. We proceed in two steps.


Step 1 This step is concerned with the insider’s optimization problem – that is, given _N_ ≥ 1, _Z_ =
( _Z_ (0), _Z_ (1)) ∈ R0 × R1, and _v_ ∈{0, 1}, we shall apply Lemma B.1 to show that the objective function
_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) has a unique maximum point _z_ [∗] _v_ [∈] [R] _[v]_ [. We assume for simplicity that][ λ][(] _[z]_ [)][ ≡] [λ][1][(] _[z]_ [) (and]
hence λ _N_ ( _z_ )) is twice-differentiable for _z_ - 0. [32] By (4.1) we have


_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) = (χ _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)]            - χ0) _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ), _z_ ∈ R _v_ . (B.4)


We shall only prove the case _v_ = 0. The case _v_ = 1 can be proved analogously.
We now restrict to _z_ < 0, and denote Λ _N_ ( _z_ ) := χ _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)]   - χ0. Recall that _QN_   - 0. By Assumption
4.1, since λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0, the (continuous) function][ Λ] _[N]_ [ is strictly increasing, with lim] _[z]_ [→−∞] [Λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ =][ −][χ][0][ ≤]
0 and lim _z_ ↗0 Λ _N_ ( _z_ ) = 1. Thus, if χ0 > 0, then Λ _N_ has a unique zero _z_ [◦] 0 [<][ 0; if][ χ][0][ =][ 0,][ Λ] _[N]_ [ >][ 0]
on (−∞, 0), and we can simply set _z_ [◦]
0 [=][ −∞][. In either case, on (] _[z]_ 0 [◦][,][ 0), we have][ Λ] _[N]_ [ >][ 0, and so]
_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) > 0. Note that lim _z_ → _z_ ◦0 _[J]_ [´] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [,][ 0)][ =][ lim] _[z]_ [↗][0][ ´] _[J][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [,][ 0)][ =][ 0, and then ´] _[J][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [,][ 0) admits a]
local maximum point _z_ [∗] 0 [∈] [(] _[z]_ [◦] 0 [,][ 0).]
To show that _z_ [∗]
0 [is the unique maximum point of ´] _[J][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;][ ·][,][ 0) on][ R][0][ =][ (][−∞][,][ 0), let us note further]
that _J_ [´] _N_ ( _Z_ ; ·, 0) ≤ 0 on (−∞, _z_ [◦] 0 [] if][ χ][0][ <][ 0, and so it su][ffi][ces to consider] _[ z]_ [ ∈] [(] _[z]_ [◦] 0 [,][ 0). By Lemma][ B.1][, the]
function _QN_ ( _Z_ ; ·, 0) > 0 is strictly log-concave. Since Λ _N_ - 0 and λ [′′] _N_ [≥] [0, then]

     (Λ _N_ ( _z_ )) [2] Λ _N_ ( _z_ )



that is, Λ _N_ is log-concave on ( _z_ [◦] 0 [,][ 0), and by (][B.4][) and Lemma][ B.1][, ´] _[J][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;][ ·][,][ 0) is strictly log-concave.]
This implies that _J_ [´] _N_ ( _Z_ ; ·, 0) admits at most one maximum point on ( _z_ [◦] 0 [,][ 0), which is] _[ z]_ [∗] 0 [.]


32The twice-differentiability of λ is mainly to ease verification of the log-concavity of Λ _N_ in (B.5). The same property
can be verified by slightly more involved arguments if λ is only convex.

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


Step 2 In this step, we show the existence of a finite- _N_ equilibrium (Definition 2.1). By continuous
differentiability from Assumption 4.1, we take the first-order conditions for (B.4). Then, following
the analysis in Step 1, any equilibrium strategy _ZN_ [∗] [=][ (] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0)][,] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1))][ ∈] [R][0][ ×][ R][1][ must satisfy the]
equilibrium conditions

By (2.3.7), we have


_J_ ˘ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) = −χλ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)(] _[v]_ [ −] [Φ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [))] _[z]_ [ −] [�][χ][ −] [χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][��][∂] _[z]_ [Φ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [)] _[z]_ [ −] _[v]_ [ +][ Φ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [)][�][.] (B.7)


Step 2.1 Consider the first-order conditions in (B.6) for _v_ = 0 first. Denote ζ _N_ [∗] [:][=] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1)][−] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0)][ >][ 0.]
Note that, for fixed ζ > 0 and _z_ < 0, by (2.3.3) and (2.3.7) we have

Based on (B.7), we define for any fixed ζ > 0

where _g_ 1, _N_ ( _z_ ) := χ _z_ λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [χ][ +][ χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][,] _g_ 2, _N_ ( _z_ ) := (χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)]       - χ) _z_ . (B.9)


Since _ZN_ [∗] [(0)][ ≤−][ζ] _N_ [∗] [, the e][ff][ective domain of] _[ F]_ 0 _[N]_ [in (][B.9][) should be (][−∞][,][ −][ζ][]; however, for technical]
reasons, we extend _F_ _[N]_
0 [to the whole (][−∞][,][ 0).]
By Assumption 4.1, since _g_ [′] 1, _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ =][ (][χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +][ χ][)][λ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +][ χ] _[z]_ [λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0, the function] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [ is strictly]
decreasing on (−∞, 0). Further, noting that lim _z_ →−∞ _g_ 1, _N_ ( _z_ ) = ∞ and lim _z_ ↗0 _g_ 1, _N_ ( _z_ ) = −1, then _g_ 1, _N_
has a unique zero _z_ [⋄]
0 [<][ 0, and thus] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0 for] _[ z]_ [ ∈] [(] _[z]_ 0 [⋄][,][ 0). We now focus on the interval (] _[z]_ [⋄] 0 [,][ 0).]
Note that _g_ [′] 2, _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ =][ χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][(] _[z]_ [λ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +][ 1)][ −] [χ][ and][ λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ >][ 0][ > λ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [) for] _[ z]_ [ <][ 0, then for] _[ z]_ [ ∈] [(] _[z]_ [⋄] 0 [,][ 0),]

thus _g_ [′] 2, _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0. Since ¯][Φ] _[N]_ [,][ ¯][Φ][′] _N_ [>][ 0 on (0][,][ ∞][), this implies that] _[ F]_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;][ ·][), along with]
_g_ 2, _N_, is strictly decreasing on ( _z_ [⋄] 0 [,][ 0). Moreover, since lim] _[z]_ [↗][0] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ =][ 0, then] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [⋄] 0 [)][ >][ 0, and]

in ( _z_ [⋄]
0 [,][ 0), denoted as][ z][0][(][ζ][).]
Denote z1(ζ) := ζ + z0(ζ) and Z [ζ] := (z0(ζ), z1(ζ)). Recall the function Λ _N_ and the point _z_ [◦] 0
from Step 1. From (B.10) we also see that Λ _N_ ( _z_ ) = _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] (χ − χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ) > 0 for _z_ ∈ ( _z_ [⋄] 0 [,][ 0), which]
implies that ( _z_ [⋄]
0 [,][ 0)][ ⊂] [(] _[z]_ 0 [◦][,][ 0), and thus, from Step 1, ´] _[J][N]_ [(][Z][ζ][;][ ·][,][ 0) is strictly log-concave on (] _[z]_ [⋄] 0 [,][ 0). It]
then follows from the first-order condition (B.6) and Step 1 that z0(ζ) is the (unique) maximum point
of _J_ [´] _N_ (Z [ζ] ; ·, 0) in R0. We remark that the above analysis does not require z1(ζ) > 0, which will be
verified later for the equilibrium however.
For the purpose of the next sub-step, let us also note that

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


Since _g_ 1, _N_, _g_ 2, _N_ are continuous and strictly decreasing on ( _z_ [⋄] 0 [,][ 0), and ¯][Φ] _[N]_ [,][ ¯][Φ][′] _N_ [are obviously contin-]
uous in ζ, it is clear that z0(ζ) is continuous in ζ. Moreover, from (B.8) one can easily see that
Φ¯ _N_ (0) = 1, ¯Φ [′] _N_ [(0)][ =][ 0. Hence, by (][B.11][), we have that lim][ζ][↘][0] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(][z][0][(][ζ][))][ =][ 0, and so]

Step 2.2 Now we turn to (B.6) for _v_ = 1, restricting to Z [ζ] := (z0(ζ), z1(ζ)) based on Step 2.1. We
stress again that at this point, we do not require z1(ζ) > 0. Note that


Φ _N_ (( _z_     - ζ, _z_ ); _z_ ) = Φ [ˆ] _N_ (ζ), (∂ _z_ Φ _N_ )(( _z_     - ζ, _z_ ); _z_ ) = Φ [ˆ] [′] _N_ [(][ζ][)][,] where

Recalling (B.7) and (B.9), we define


_G_ 1 _[N]_ [(][ζ][) :][=][ ˘] _[J][N]_ [(][Z][ζ][;][ z][1][(][ζ][)][,][ 1)][ =] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(][z][1][(][ζ][))][�][Φ][ˆ] _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ −] [1][�] [+] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(][z][1][(][ζ][)) ˆ][Φ][′] _N_ [(][ζ][)][.] (B.14)


Note that z1(ζ) = ζ +z0(ζ) is continuous for ζ > 0 and z0(ζ) > _z_ [⋄] 0 [. By (][B.12][) we have lim][ζ][↘][0][ z][1][(][ζ][)][ =]
_z_ [⋄]
0 [<][ 0 and lim][ζ][→∞] [z][1][(][ζ][)][ =][ ∞][. It is implied that there exists ˘][ζ >][ 0 such that][ z][1][(˘][ζ][)][ =][ 0, and we choose]
the largest such ζ [˘], i.e., such that z1(ζ) > 0 for all ζ > ζ [˘] . Since Φ [ˆ] _N_ (ζ [˘] ) < 1, then by (B.9) and (B.14)
we have
lim _G_ 1 _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ =][ �][χ][ −] [χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(0)][��][1][ −] [Φ][ˆ] _[N]_ [(˘][ζ][)][�] [=][ 1][ −] [Φ][ˆ] _[N]_ [(˘][ζ][)][ >][ 0][.] (B.15)
ζ↘ζ [˘]


On the other hand, since _g_ 1, _N_ (0) = −χ + χ0 = −1 < 0, and clearly lim _z_ →∞ _g_ 1, _N_ ( _z_ ) = ∞, then there
exists ˆ _z_ ∈ (0, ∞) such that _g_ 1, _N_ (ˆ _z_ ) = 0. In particular, this implies that χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(ˆ] _[z]_ [)] - χ = −χ _z_ ˆλ [′] _N_ [(ˆ] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0, and]
so _g_ 2, _N_ (ˆ _z_ ) = (χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(ˆ] _[z]_ [)] - χ)ˆ _z_ < 0. Moreover, recalling again that z1(ζ) is continuous with z1(ζ [˘] ) = 0
and limζ→∞ z1(ζ) = ∞, then there exists ζ > [ˆ] ζ [˘] such that z1(ζ [ˆ] ) = ˆ _z_ . Therefore,


_G_ 1 _[N]_ [(ˆ][ζ][)][ =] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(ˆ] _[z]_ [)][�][Φ][ˆ] _[N]_ [(ˆ][ζ][)][ −] [1][�] [+] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(ˆ] _[z]_ [) ˆ][Φ][′] _N_ [(ˆ][ζ][)][ =] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(ˆ] _[z]_ [) ˆ][Φ][′] _N_ [(ˆ][ζ][)][ <][ 0][.]


This, together with (B.15), implies that there exists ζ [∗] ∈ (ζ, [˘] ζ [ˆ] ) such that _G_ _[N]_
1 [(][ζ][∗][)][ =][ 0.]
Finally, since ζ [˘] is the largest zero of z1 and ζ [∗]   - ζ [˘], we have z1(ζ [∗] ) > 0. Then, by the reasoning
in Step 2.1 and Step 1 again, it follows that z1(ζ [∗] ) is also the unique maximum point of _J_ [´] _N_ (Z [ζ][∗] ; ·, 1)
on R1. This, together with Step 2.1, implies that (Z [ζ][∗], _PN_ (Z [ζ][∗] ; ·)) is an equilibrium in the sense of
Definition 2.1, as required. 

**Proof of Theorem 4.1 Assertion (ii).** We shall prove the “if” direction and the “only if” direction

in particular, the case γ > 1/2 follows by using (3.2) and (B.16) so that


Φ˜ [γ] _N_ [( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [)][ =][ E][�][1] { _N_ [1][/][2][−][γ] _W_ + _z_ ˜> _z_ [∗] γ} [+] _[ p]_ [1] { _N_ [1][/][2][−][γ] _W_ + _z_ ˜= _z_ [∗] γ}� → 1{ _z_ ˜> _z_ ∗γ} + 21 [1][{] _[z]_ [˜][=] _[z]_ γ [∗] [}][.]


Step 1 In this step we prove the “if” direction. Assume γ = min{β, 1/2}. We naturally examine
(B.16) in two cases.

Case 1 γ = β < 1/2. In this case, by Definition 3.1 (ii) and (3.3) from Proposition 3.1, we must set
_P_ ˜ [∗] γ [=] _[ p]_ [, and it is unique. Further, (][B.16][) gives that]


_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ (] _[v]_ [ −] _[p]_ [)˜] _[z]_ [ �][χ] _[e]_ [−][λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)][ −] [χ][0] �, _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_ . (B.18)


Similar to (B.6), we define for ˜ _z_ ∈ R _v_


_J_ ˘∞ [γ] [(˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [) :][=] _[ e]_ [λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)][∂] _z_ ˜ _[J]_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ (] _[v]_ [ −] _[p]_ [)][�][χ][ −] [χ] _[z]_ [˜][λ][′][(˜] _[z]_ [)][ −] [χ][0] _[e]_ [λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)][�][;]

When _v_ = 0, by Assumption 4.1, one can easily see that


lim _J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0)][ =][ 0][,] lim _J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0)][ =][ −∞][;]

_z_ ˜↗0 _z_ ˜→−∞


Based on the first and third limits in (B.20), we have that _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0)][ >][ 0 when ˜] _[z]_ [ <][ 0 is close]
to 0. Along with the second limit, this implies that the function _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0) has a maximum point]
_Z_ ˜γ [∗][(0)][ ∈] [(][−∞][,][ 0), with ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][,][ 0)][>][0. Clearly,][ ∂] _[z]_ [˜] _[J]_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][,][ 0)][ =][ 0. Also, from the second line]
of (B.20), we see that _J_ [˘] ∞ [γ] [(˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0), and hence][ ∂] _z_ ˜ _[J]_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0), has a unique zero. Thus, ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0) is the unique]
maximum point of _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [;][ ·][,][ 0) in (][−∞][,][ 0).]
Similarly, when _v_ = 1, we have

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


Case 2 γ = 1/2 ≤ β. In this case, by (3.2), (B.16), and (2.3.7) (with _N_ = 1), we have

_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ lim] �χ _e_ −λ( _N_ γ−β _z_ ˜) − χ0� _Q_ 1( ˜ _Z_ γ∗ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][,] _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_ . (B.21)
_N_ →∞


When β = 1/2, this is the same as (B.4) with _N_ = 1, and by assertion (i) of Theorem 4.1 we know
that there exists a γ-limiting equilibrium.
Now consider the case β > 1/2 = γ. Then _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =] _[ Q]_ [1][( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [), ˜] _[z]_ [ ∈] [R] _[v]_ [, which is in the form]
of (B.4) with _N_ = 1 and λ = 0 (hence violating Assumption 4.1). In particular, (B.9) becomes (using
_z_ instead of ˜ _z_ and fixed ζ > 0) _F_ [1]
0 [(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ =][ −][Φ][¯] [1][(][ζ][)][−] _[z]_ [Φ][ ¯] [′] 1 [(][ζ][),] _[ z]_ [ <][ 0, with a unique zero][ z][0][(][ζ][) :][=][ −][Φ][¯] [1][(][ζ][)][/]
Φ¯ [′]
1 [(][ζ][)][ <][ 0. We claim that]
lim lim (B.22)
ζ↘0 [z][0][(][ζ][)][ =][ −∞][,] ζ→∞ [z][0][(][ζ][)][ =][ 0][.]

From (B.8), the first limit is obvious. To see the second limit, consider an arbitrary _c_ - 0 and the
function




                 - 1 + _q_ [�] 1 − _[c]_ [ζ]                 - _e_ η¯1(ζ)

.



Recall that _W_ =d. Normal(0, σ2). By (B.8), ¯η1(ζ) = ζ(ζ − 2 _W_ )/(2σ2) =d. Normal(ζ2/(2σ2), ζ2/σ2).
After some rearrangement, we obtain

Thus, it is clear that limζ→∞ - _A_ ¯1(ζ) + _q_ (1 − _c_ ζ/σ2) ¯ _A_ 2(ζ)� = −∞, which implies that ¯Φ _c_ 1 [(][ζ][)][ <][ 0 for]
ζ > 0 sufficiently large. Thus, Φ [¯] 1(ζ) - _c_ Φ [¯] [′] 1 [(][ζ][)][ <][ 0 and][ z][0][(][ζ][)][ =][ −][Φ][¯] [1][(][ζ][)][/][ ¯][Φ][′] 1 [(][ζ][)][ ≥−] _[c]_ [ for all su][ffi][ciently]
large ζ. Since _c_ - 0 is arbitrary, we must have limζ→∞ z0(ζ) = 0.
Next we analyze _G_ [1]
1 [(][ζ][). In particular, (][B.14][) becomes]

_G_ [1] 1 [(][ζ][)][ =][ −][�][Φ][ˆ] [1][(][ζ][)][ −] [1][�] [−] [z][1][(][ζ][) ˆ][Φ][′] 1 [(][ζ][)][,] z1(ζ) = ζ + z0(ζ). (B.23)

By (B.22), we have that limζ↘0 z1(ζ) = −∞ and limζ→∞ z1(ζ) = ∞. Thus, there exists ζ > [˘] 0 such
that z1(ζ [˘] ) = 0 and z1(ζ) > 0 for all ζ > ζ [˘] . From (B.23), clearly _G_ [1] 1 [(˘][ζ][)][ >][ 0. Also, recalling (][B.13][)]

Noting that limζ→∞ _A_ [ˆ] 1(ζ), limζ→∞ _A_ [ˆ] 2(ζ) ∈ (0, ∞), and limζ→∞ z1(ζ) = ∞, we have limζ→∞ - _A_ ˆ1(ζ) −
(ζz1(ζ)/σ [2] ) _A_ [ˆ] 2(ζ) [�] = −∞, and so _G_ [1] 1 [(][ζ][)][ <][ 0 for][ ζ][ su][ffi][ciently large. Since] _[ G]_ [1] 1 [(˘][ζ][)][ >][ 0, then there exists]
ζ [∗] - ζ [˘] such that _G_ [1]
1 [(][ζ][∗][)][ =][ 0. Thus, following the same arguments as in Step 2 of the proof of assertion]
(i), (Z [ζ][∗], _P_ 1(Z [ζ][∗] ; ·)) is a γ-limiting equilibrium in the sense of Definition 3.1.


Step 2 We now prove the “only if” direction. Assume that there exists a γ-limiting equilibrium.

Case 3 γ < 1/2. Then, from (3.2), _P_ [˜] [∗] γ [=] _[ p]_ [, and so by (][B.16][) and (][B.17][),]



_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =]



( _v_  - _p_ )˜ _z_, if γ < β,
( _v_  - _p_ )˜ _z_ (χ _e_ [−][λ][(] _[z]_ [)]  - χ0), if γ = β,

−χ0( _v_ - _p_ )˜ _z_, if γ > β,



_z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_ .



Clearly, in the cases γ < β and γ > β with χ0 > 0, _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [;][ ·][,] _[ v]_ [) has no maximum point in][ R] _[v]_ [. In the]
case γ > β with χ0 = 0, _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ 0 for all ˜] _[z]_ [ ∈] [R] _[v]_ [, but since in Definition][ 3.1][ condition (i) we]
require _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ �] [0, there is no such ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [). Thus, we must have][ γ][ =][ β][, and since][ γ <][ 1][/][2,]
we obtain γ = min{β, 1/2}.

Case 4 γ = 1/2. If β < 1/2, then by (B.21) and (B.17), _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ −][χ][0] _[Q]_ [1][( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [), ˜] _[z]_ [ ∈] [R] _[v]_ [.]
By Lemma B.1, _Q_ 1( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [) is strictly log-concave in] _[ z]_ [ ∈] [R] _[v]_ [; hence, if][ χ][0] [>][ 0, ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [;][ ·][,] _[ v]_ [) has no]
maximum point in R _v_, while if χ0 = 0, then _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [;][ ·][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ 0, also a violation, and it must be that]
β ≥ 1/2; thus, γ = min{β, 1/2}.


Case 5 γ > 1/2. Then, (B.16) and (B.17) imply that


_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ ˜] _[z]_ [�] _[v]_ [ −] [1][{] _[z]_ [˜][>] _[z]_ [∗] γ [}] [−] [1] 2 [1][{] _[z]_ [˜][=] _[z]_ γ [∗] [}]        - _N_ lim→∞ �χ _e_ −λ( _N_ γ−β _z_ ˜) − χ0�, _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_,


with the limit being finite. When _z_ [∗] γ [≥] [0, we have ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0)][ =][ 0 for all ˜] _[z]_ [ <][ 0, which again violates]
the requirement _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][,][ 0)][ �] [0. Similarly, when] _[ z]_ [∗] γ [<][ 0, we have ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 1)][ =][ 0 for all ˜] _[z]_ [ >][ 0.]
Therefore, there is no γ-limiting equilibrium. 

**Proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (iii).** Let Assumption 4.1 still hold. We now prove the convergence of a finite- _N_ equilibrium ( _ZN_ [∗] [,] _[ P]_ [∗] _N_ [) (Definition][ 2.1][) towards the unique][ γ][-limiting equilibrium]
( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [=] _[ p]_ [), in the case][ γ][ =][ β <][ 1][/][2. We proceed in three steps.]

Step 1 In this step, we show that ˜ _zv_ _[N]_ [:][=] _[ N]_ [−][γ] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [) is bounded in] _[ N]_ [. Consider] _[ v]_ [ =][ 0 first. From Step]

2.1 in the proof of Assertion (i), we see that _z_ [⋄] 0 [,] _[N]_ < _ZN_ [∗] [(0)][ <][ 0, where] _[ z]_ [⋄] 0 [,] _[N]_ = _z_ [⋄] 0 [is the unique zero of]
_g_ 1, _N_ defined in (B.9). Noting that


_g_ 1, _N_ ( _z_ ) = χ _zN_ [−][β] λ [′] ( _N_ [−][β] _z_ ) − χ + χ0 _e_ [λ][(] _[N]_ [−][β] _[z]_ [)] = _g_ 1,1( _N_ [−][β] _z_ ), _z_ < 0, (B.24)


then _z_ [⋄] 0 [,] _[N]_ = _N_ [β] _z_ [⋄] 0 [,][1][, where] _[ z]_ 0 [⋄][,][1] is the unique zero of _g_ 1,1, depending only on the model parameters.
Since γ = β, we have _z_ [⋄] 0 [,][1] ≤ _z_ ˜0 _[N]_ [<][ 0, and so ˜] _[z]_ 0 _[N]_ [is bounded. We shall put][ |] _[z]_ [˜] 0 _[N]_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [0][, for some constant]
_K_ 0 > 0.

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


In the same fashion we can prove that | _z_ ˜1 _[N]_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [0][ for possibly larger] _[ K]_ [0][. Note that one may not use]
the function _G_ _[N]_
1 [from (][B.14][) for this purpose – instead, the following function that is the counterpart]
of _F_ _[N]_
0 [in (][B.9][) for] _[ v]_ [ =][ 1 and satisfies] _[ G]_ 1 _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ =] _[ F]_ 1 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;][ z][1][(][ζ][)) should be used:]

Step 2 In this step, we prove the desired uniform convergence of _Fv_ _[N]_ [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜][ζ][;] _[ N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜][). Recall ˘] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [(˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [) in]
(B.19). For _v_ = 0, ζ > [˜] 0, and ˜ _z_ < 0, using (B.9) further we have

From Step 1, we know | _z_ ˜ _v_ _[N]_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [0] [and ˜][ζ] _[N]_ [ :][=][ ˜] _[z]_ 1 _[N]_ [−] _[z]_ [˜] 0 _[N]_ [≤] [2] _[K]_ [0][, so from now on we shall restrict to]

- _K_ 0 ≤ _z_ ˜ < 0 and 0 < ζ [˜] ≤ 2 _K_ 0. In particular, this implies that | _g_ 1,1(˜ _z_ )|, | _g_ 2,1(˜ _z_ )| ≤ _K_ ; here, we use
_K_ - 0 to denote a generic constant that depends only on the model parameters, and its value may
vary from line to line.
Since _x_ /(1 + _x_ ) [2] ≤ 1/4, by (B.8) we have for ζ [˜] ∈ (0, 2 _K_ 0],




             - _qe_ [η][¯] _[N]_ [(][ζ][)]

Moreover, one can easily verify that Φ [¯] _N_ ( _N_ [γ][ ˜] ζ) = Φ¯ 1� _N_ γ−1/2ζ˜�, ¯Φ1(0) = _p_, as well as ¯Φ′1 [(0)][ =]

(0, 2 _K_ 0], we have
���Φ¯ _N_ ( _N_ γ ˜ζ) − _p_ ��� = ���Φ¯ 1� _N_ γ− 21 ζ˜ [�]                   - Φ¯ 1(0)��� ≤ _K_ ��� _N_ γ− 21 ζ˜���2 ≤ _KN_ 2γ−1.



21 ζ˜���2 ≤ _KN_ 2γ−1.

Putting things together, we have shown that

It is similar to establish that supζ˜∈(0,2 _K_ 0], ˜ _z_ ∈(0, _K_ 0] ��� _F_ 1 _N_ [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜][ζ][;] _[ N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜][)][ −] _[J]_ [˘] ∞ [γ] [(˜] _[z]_ [,][ 1)] ��� ≤ _KN_ 2γ−1.

Step 3 We now prove (4.3). Since _F_ 0 _[N]_ [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜][ζ] _[N]_ [;] _[ N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜] 0 _[N]_ [)][ =][ ˘] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][,][ 0)][ =][ 0, (][B.26][) implies]

Note that by (B.19),

By (B.27), this further implies that for _N_ large such that _KN_ [2][γ][−][1] < _c_ 0| _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][|][/][2, we must have ˜] _[z]_ 0 _[N]_ [≤]

where ˜κ _N_ is as in (A.1) corresponding to _Z_ [˜] = _N_ [−][γ] _ZN_ [∗] [and ˜] _[y]_ [ =] _[ N]_ [−][1][/][2] _[y]_ [. By Step 1,][ |][ ˜] _[Z]_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [0][. Since]
γ < 1/2, then it follows from (A.2) that


|κ˜ _N_ (˜ _y_ )| ≤ _K_ [�] | _y_ ˜| _N_ [γ][−] [1] 2 + _N_ [2][γ][−][1][�] = _K_ [�] | _y_ | _N_ [γ][−][1] + _N_ [2][γ][−][1][�] .


Therefore, recalling _q_ = (1 − _p_ )/ _p_, we have


1 |1 − _e_ κ˜ _N_ (˜ _y_ )|
| _P_ [∗] _N_ [(] _[y]_ [)][ −] _[p]_ [|][ =] ����� 1 + _qe_ [κ][˜] _[N]_ [(˜] _[y]_ [)] [−] _[p]_ ����� = (1 − _p_ ) 1 + _qe_ [κ][˜] _[N]_ [(˜] _[y]_ [)] [≤] _[K]_ [�][|] _[y]_ [|] _[N]_ [γ][−][1][ +] _[ N]_ [2][γ][−][1][�][,]


proving the first estimate in (4.4). Finally, the last bound, along with the boundedness of _N_ [−][γ] _ZN_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [)]
established in Step 1, immediately leads to the second estimate in (4.4), completing the proof. 
### **Appendix C Proof of Theorem 4.2**


We have γ = β < 1/2. First, (4.1) and (B.18) together imply that, for _v_ ∈{0, 1} and _z_ ∈ R _v_,


_N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _z_, _v_ ) = ( _v_      - _p_ ) _N_ [−][γ] _z_ [�] χ _e_ [−][λ][(] _[N]_ [−][γ] _[z]_ [)]      - χ0� = ˜ _J_ ∞γ [(] _[p]_ [;] _[ N]_ [−][γ] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][.]


Then, based on Definition 3.1, since


_N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _N_ [γ][ ˜] _Z_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [(] _[p]_ [; ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ sup] _J_ ˜∞ [γ] [(] _[p]_ [;] _[ N]_ [−][γ] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ sup] _N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _z_, _v_ ),
_z_ ∈R _v_ _z_ ∈R _v_


we have that (4.6) in Definition 4.1 holds with ϵ = 0.
Next, since max{γ, 1/2} = 1/2, by (A.1) we have _PN_ ( _N_ [γ][ ˜] _Z_ γ [∗][;] _[ N]_ [1][/][2] _[y]_ [˜][)][ =][ 1][/][(1][ +] _[ qe]_ [κ][˜] _[N]_ [(˜] _[y]_ [)][), where ˜][κ] _[N]_
corresponds to _Z_ [˜] = _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][. As ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗] [is independent of] _[ N]_ [, it follows from the exact same arguments for (][4.3][)]
that
��� _PN_ ( _N_ γ ˜ _Z_ γ∗ [;] _[ N]_ 12 _y_ ˜) − _p_ ��� ≤ _K_ �| _N_ 12 _y_ ˜| _N_ [γ][−][1] + _N_ [2][γ][−][1][�] ≤ _KN_ [γ][−] 2 [1] (| _y_ ˜| + 1),

which verifies (4.7) with ϵ ≡ ϵ _N_ = _KN_ [γ][−][1][/][2], hence (4.8). The proof is complete.

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_

### **Supplemental Appendix A Proofs in further discussions**


This supplemental appendix presents formal statements and their detailed proofs in the further discussions on the general scenario involving criminal penalties in Section 6. The proofs are structurally
similar to that of Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 as presented in Appendix B and Appendix C, but
with notable technical differences.


**Theorem SA.1.** _Consider the setting of (6.1), and let Assumption 6.1 hold. We have the follow-_
_ing four assertions._


_(i) For every N_ ≥ 1 _, there exists an equilibrium_ ( _ZN_ [∗] [,] _[ P]_ [∗] _N_ [)] _[ in the sense of Definition][ 2.1][.]_

_holds. Moreover, when_ γ < 1/2 _, the_ γ _-limiting equilibrium_ ( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [)] _[ is unique with]_ [ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [=] _[ p][.]_

_there exists a constant K_ - 0 _, depending only on the model parameters but not on N, such that, for_

Before proving Theorem SA.1, we make a few additional comments on the convergence implications. Compared with Theorem 4.1, assertion (iii) in Theorem SA.1 indicates the joint dependence
of the convergence rate for the optimal strategies on both the intensity of investigation (β) and the
severity of criminal penalties (α), signaling a tradeoff between small and large values of γ. Within
the maximum brackets in (SA.1), the first component (2γ − 1) stems from the convergence of the
price function, whereas the second and third components (−γ(α − 1)θ [′] or −γα [′] ) is a result of the large
argument behavior for _C_ 0 (as stated in Assumption 6.1). Intuitively, when investigations are sensitive
to the population size (β > 0), the imposition of criminal penalties upon prosecution can substantially
alter the convergence rate depending on their specific form. In this case, the jump in the convergence
rate as α ↘ 1 in (SA.1) results from the at-most-linear growth of the insider’s expected profit with
his trade size (see (6.2)), which can be coalesced into the penalty component if and only if α = 1.
Further details can be found in the proof of Theorem SA.1.


To prepare for the proof of Theorem SA.1, we establish a technical lemma.


**Lemma SA.1.** _Consider the setting of Lemma B.1, and define_


_RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) := _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ∂ _z_ �(χ _e_ −λ _N_ ( _z_ ) − χ0) _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ )�, _z_ ∈ R _v_, _v_ ∈{0, 1}. (SA.3)


36


_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


_Then, the following two assertions hold._


_(i) RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) _, z_ < 0 _, admits a unique zero_ ˘ _z_ 0 < 0 _. Also, RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) > 0 _for z_ < ˘ _z_ 0 _, and RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) _is_
_negative and strictly decreasing for z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0) _._
_(ii) RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 1) _, z_ - 0 _, admits a unique zero_ ˘ _z_ 1 > 0 _. Also, RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 1) < 0 _for z_ - ˘ _z_ 1 _, and RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 1) _is_
_positive and strictly decreasing for z_ ∈ (0, ˘ _z_ 1) _._


**Proof.** We only consider the case _v_ = 0, with _z_ < 0; the case _v_ = 1 (with _z_ - 0) can be proved
in the same way. As before, without loss of generality, we assume in the proof that λ( _z_ ) is twicedifferentiable for _z_ - 0, and for notational simplicity we suppress the symbol _Z_ in all the functions.
By Step 1 in the proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (i), the function (χ _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)]   - χ0) _QN_ ( _z_, 0), _z_ < 0,
admits a unique maximum point ˘ _z_ 0 < 0, and it satisfies _RN_ (˘ _z_ 0, 0) = 0, _RN_ ( _z_, 0) > 0 for _z_ < ˘ _z_ 0, and
_RN_ ( _z_, 0) < 0 for _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0). Moreover, since _QN_ - 0, it is clear that χ _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(˘] _[z]_ [0][)] - χ0 > 0, and then by
the monotonicity of λ _N_, we see that χ _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] - χ0 > 0 for all _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0).
It remains to show that _RN_ ( _z_, 0) is strictly decreasing in (˘ _z_ 0, 0). Let us write


_HN_ ( _z_ ) := (χ − χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] )Φ _N_ ( _z_ ) > 0, _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0). (SA.4)


Then, (χ _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] - χ0) _QN_ ( _z_, 0) = (− _z_ ) _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _HN_ ( _z_ ), and thus, for _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0),


_RN_ ( _z_, 0) = ( _z_ λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [1)] _[H][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] _[zH]_ _N_ [′] [(] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0;] (SA.5)

∂ _zRN_ ( _z_, 0) = (λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +] _[ z]_ [λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))] _[H][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +][ (] _[z]_ [λ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [2)] _[H]_ _N_ [′] [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] _[zH]_ _N_ [′′][(] _[z]_ [)][.] (SA.6)


Recall that χ − χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] - 0 for _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0), and similar to (B.5), we have



d [2] χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ((λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))][2] [+][ λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))]

d _z_ [2] [log][ �][χ][ −] [χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][�] [=][ −] χ − χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)]




[≤] [0][,]
(χ − χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ) [2]



d [2]




[)] ((λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))][2] [+][ λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))] (χ0λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][)][2]

      χ − χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] (χ − χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ) [2]



implying that χ−χ0 _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] is log-concave. From the proof of Lemma B.1, we know that Φ _N_ is also logconcave, and so _HN_ is log-concave in (˘ _z_ 0, 0). This implies that _HN_ ( _z_ ) _HN_ [′′][(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [(] _[H]_ _N_ [′] [(] _[z]_ [))][2][ ≤] [0. Hence,]
from (SA.6) we obtain


( _HN_ [′] [(] _[z]_ [))][2]
∂ _zRN_ ( _z_, 0) ≤ (λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +] _[ z]_ [λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))] _[H][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +][ (] _[z]_ [λ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [2)] _[H]_ _N_ [′] [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] _[z]_

_HN_ ( _z_ )

_H_ [′]
= (λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +] _[ z]_ [λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))] _[H][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)] �( _z_ λ′ _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [2)] _[H][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] _[zH]_ _N_ [′] [(] _[z]_ [)][�]
_HN_ ( _z_ )

_H_ [′]
= (λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +] _[ z]_ [λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [))] _[H][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)]            - _RN_ ( _z_, 0) − _HN_ ( _z_ )�,
_HN_ ( _z_ )


where the last line is due to (SA.5). Note further that for _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0),


_HN_ [′] [(] _[z]_ [) :][=][ −][χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][λ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][Φ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +][ (][χ][ −] [χ][0] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][)][Φ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ >][ 0][,]


and thus, by (SA.5) again and Assumption 6.1, ∂ _zRN_ ( _z_, 0) < 0 for _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0). 

**Proof of Theorem SA.1 assertion (i).** Consider the equilibrium in Definition 2.1 for fixed _N_ ≥ 1.
Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (i), we proceed in two steps.

_The Camoufage Efect in Insider Trading_


Step 1 In this step we show that, given _Z_ = ( _Z_ (0), _Z_ (1)) ∈ R0 × R1, the insider’s objective function
_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) from (2.3.8) has a unique maximum point _z_ [∗] _v_ [∈] [R] _[v]_ [. Without loss of generality, assume as]
before that λ and _C_ 0 are twice-differentiable for _z_ - 0, and again we shall only consider the case
_v_ = 0.
First, by (6.1) and (B.4) we have that, for _z_ < 0,


_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) = (χ _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)]          - χ0) _QN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, _v_ ) − (1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ) _C_ 0( _z_ ).


Then, recalling (SA.3), we have


_J_ ˘ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) := _e_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)] ∂ _z_ ´ _JN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) = _RN_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) + _AN_ ( _z_ ), (SA.7)

where _AN_ ( _z_ ) := −λ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _[C]_ [0][(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [(] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [1)] _[C]_ 0 [′] [(] _[z]_ [)][.] (SA.8)


By Assumption 6.1, it is clear that _AN_ ( _z_ ) ≥ 0 for _z_ < 0, and

_A_ [′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ =][ −][λ][′′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _[C]_ [0][(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [(] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +][ 1)][λ][′] _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)] _[C]_ 0 [′] [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [(] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ −] [1)] _[C]_ 0 [′′][(] _[z]_ [)][ ≤] [0][.] (SA.9)


Let ˘ _z_ 0 be as in Lemma SA.1. Then, it follows from (SA.7) that


_J_ ˘ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) > 0, _z_ ≤ _z_ ˘0 and ∂ _zJ_ [˘] _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) < 0, _z_ ∈ (˘ _z_ 0, 0). (SA.10)


Note further that, by (SA.5) and (SA.4),


lim _J_ ˘ _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) = lim (SA.11)
_z_ ↗0 _z_ ↗0 _[R][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [,][ 0)][ =][ −][Φ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [; 0)][ <][ 0][,]


which means that _J_ [˘] _N_ ( _Z_ ; ·, 0) has a unique zero _z_ [∗] 0 [∈] [(˘] _[z]_ [0][,][ 0), and by (][SA.10][), ˘] _[J][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [;] _[ z]_ [,][ 0)][ >][ 0 for] _[ z]_ [ <] _[ z]_ [∗] 0
and _J_ [˘] _N_ ( _Z_ ; _z_, 0) < 0 for _z_ ∈ ( _z_ [∗] 0 [,][ 0). By continuity, this implies that] _[ z]_ [∗] 0 [is the unique maximum point of]
_J_ ´ _N_ ( _Z_ ; ·, 0) on R0 = (−∞, 0).


Step 2 This step is concerned with the existence of a finite- _N_ equilibrium (Definition 2.1). As
established in Step 1, _ZN_ [∗] [=][ (] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0)][,] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1))][ ∈] [R][0][ ×][ R][1][ is an equilibrium strategy, i.e., (] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [,] _[ P][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [;][ ·][))]
is an equilibrium, if and only if it satisfies the equilibrium conditions


_J_ ˘ _N_ ( _ZN_ [∗] [;] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =] _[ R][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [;] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ +] _[ A][N]_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(] _[v]_ [))][ =][ 0][,] _v_ ∈{0, 1}, (SA.12)


again with _ZN_ [∗] [(0)][,] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1)][ �] [0.]
Consider (SA.12) for _v_ = 0. With ζ _N_ [∗] [=] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1)][ −] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0)][ ≥] [0, fixing arbitrary][ ζ >][ 0 as a parameter,]
we introduce the following function on (−∞, 0):


_F_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [) :][=][ ˘] _[J][N]_ [((] _[z]_ [, ζ][ +] _[ z]_ [);] _[ z]_ [,][ 0)][ =] _[ R][N]_ [((] _[z]_ [, ζ][ +] _[ z]_ [);] _[ z]_ [,][ 0)][ +] _[ A][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][,] _z_ < 0. (SA.13)


Recalling (B.8) and (B.9), we have


_F_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ =] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [) ¯][Φ] _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ +] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [) ¯][Φ][′] _N_ [(][ζ][)][ +] _[ A][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][,] _z_ < 0. (SA.14)


By Step 2.1 in the proof of Theorem 4.1 (i), _g_ 1, _N_ has a unique zero _z_ [⋄] 0 [<][ 0 such that] _[ g]_ 1 [′], _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0]
and _g_ [′] 2, _N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ <][ 0][ <] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [) for] _[ z]_ [ ∈] [(] _[z]_ [⋄] 0 [,][ 0). Since ¯][Φ] _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ >][ 0, ¯][Φ][′] _N_ [(][ζ][)][ >][ 0, and] _[ A][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ ≥] [0,]
_A_ [′]
_N_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ ≤] [0, then] _[ F]_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ 0 [⋄][)][ >][ 0 and][ ∂] _[z][F]_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ <][ 0 for] _[ z]_ [ ∈] [(] _[z]_ 0 [⋄][,][ 0). Similarly as in (][SA.11][), we have]


38


_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


lim _z_ ↗0 _F_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ =][ −][Φ][¯] _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ <][ 0, and so] _[ F]_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;][ ·][) has a unique zero in (] _[z]_ 0 [⋄][,][ 0), denoted as][ z][0][(][ζ][), which]
is a continuous function of ζ. Moreover, since Φ [¯] _N_ (0) = 1 and Φ [¯] [′] _N_ [(0)][ =][ 0, we have]

0 = limζ↘0 _[F]_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ][;][ z][0][(][ζ][))][ =][ lim] ζ↘0                - _g_ 1, _N_ (z0(ζ)) + _AN_ (z0(ζ))�.


Again, noting that _g_ [′] 1, _N_ [<][ 0 and] _[ A]_ [′] _N_ [≤] [0, then by (][B.9][) and (][SA.8][), lim] _[z]_ [↗][0][(] _[g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(] _[z]_ [)][ +] _[ A][N]_ [(] _[z]_ [))][ =][ −][1][ <][ 0,]
and so we have limζ↘0 z0(ζ) < 0.
Next, consider (SA.12) for _v_ = 1. As in the proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (i), we denote
z1(ζ) := ζ + z0(ζ) and Z(ζ) := (z0(ζ), z1(ζ)). Recalling (B.13), by (B.14),

_G_ 1 _[N]_ [(][ζ][) :][=][ ˘] _[J][N]_ [(][Z][ζ][;][ z][1][(][ζ][)][,][ 1)][ =] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [(][z][1][(][ζ][))][�][Φ][ˆ] _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ −] [1][�] [+] _[ g]_ [2][,] _[N]_ [(][z][1][(][ζ][)) ˆ][Φ][′] _N_ [(][ζ][)][ +] _[ A][N]_ [(][z][1][(][ζ][))][,]

where Φ [ˆ] _N_ and Φ [ˆ] [′] _N_ [are given in (][B.13][). Since lim][ζ][↘][0][ z][0][(][ζ][)][ <][ 0 and][ z][0][(][ζ][)][ ∈] [(] _[z]_ 0 [⋄][,][ 0), lim][ζ][↘][0][ z][1][(][ζ][)][ <][ 0]
and limζ→∞ z1(ζ) = ∞. Hence, there exists ζ > [˘] 0 such that z1(ζ [˘] ) = 0. Let ζ [˘] be the largest one having
this property, so that z1(ζ) > 0 for all ζ > ζ [˘] . Note that lim _z_ ↗0 _g_ 1, _N_ ( _z_ ) = −1, lim _z_ ↗0 _g_ 2, _N_ ( _z_ ) = 0, and
lim _z_ ↗0 _AN_ ( _z_ ) = 0, and so _G_ 1 _[N]_ [(˘][ζ][)][ =][ 1][ −] [Φ][ˆ] _[N]_ [(˘][ζ][)][ >][ 0. Moreover, similarly to Step 2.2 in the proof of]
Theorem 4.1 assertion (i), there exists ζ > [ˆ] ζ [˘] such that _g_ 1, _N_ (z1(ζ [ˆ] )) = 0 and _g_ 2, _N_ (z1(ζ [ˆ] )) < 0. Note
that Φ [ˆ] [′] _N_ [(ˆ][ζ][)][ >][ 0 and, by (][SA.8][),] _[ A][N]_ [(][z][1][(ˆ][ζ][))][ ≤] [0 (as][ z][1][(ˆ][ζ][)][ >][ 0), and then] _[ G]_ 1 _[N]_ [(ˆ][ζ][)][ <][ 0. Thus, there]
exists ζ [∗] ∈ (ζ, [˘] ζ [ˆ] ) such that _G_ _[N]_
1 [(][ζ][∗][)][ =][ 0. Therefore, (][Z][ζ][∗][,] _[ P][N]_ [(][Z][ζ][∗][;][ ·][)), with][ Z][ζ][∗] [=][ �][z][0][(][ζ][∗][)][,][ z][1][(][ζ][∗][)][�][, is]
a finite- _N_ equilibrium in the sense of Definition 2.1. 

**Proof of Theorem SA.1 assertion (ii).** As before, we prove the “if” direction and the “only if”
direction separately. In a similar fashion as in (B.16), especially for Φ [˜] [γ] _N_ [( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [), given any][ γ][-limiting]
equilibrium ( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [), we have that for ˜] _[z]_ [ ∈] [R] _[v]_ [,] _[ v]_ [ ∈{][0][,][ 1][}][,]

Let us recall (B.16) and the limits in (B.17). Also, under Assumption 6.1, the following additional
limits are easily justified: For ˜ _z_ - 0,

Step 1 In this step we prove the “if” direction in two cases. Assume (6.5) holds, and note that
βθ/(θ + α − 1) ≤ β, with equality holding if and only if β = 0 or α = 1.
Case 1 γ = βθ/(θ + α − 1) < 1/2. We must set _P_ [˜] [∗] γ [=] _[ p]_ [, and it is unique.]
Case 1.1 γ = β = 0. In this case, (SA.15) becomes

_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ (] _[v]_ [ −] _[p]_ [)˜] _[z]_ [ �][χ] _[e]_ [−][λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)][ −] [χ][0]    -    - (1 − _e_ −λ(˜ _z_ )) _C_ 0(˜ _z_ ), _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_, _v_ ∈{0, 1}. (SA.18)


Analogous to (B.19), for _AN_ (˜ _z_ ) (from (SA.8)) with _N_ = 1,

For _v_ = 0, under Assumption 6.1, it is clear that all the statements in (B.20) remain true. Thus,
by following the same arguments after (B.20) we see that _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [;][ ·][,][ 0) has a unique maximum point]
_Z_ ˜γ [∗][(0)][ <][ 0. For] _[ v]_ [ =][ 1, it is similar that ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [;][ ·][,][ 1) has a unique maximum point ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1)][ >][ 0. Therefore,]
_Z_ ˜γ [∗] [=][ ( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][,][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1)), together with ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [≡] _[p]_ [, forms the unique][ γ][-limiting equilibrium.]
Case 1.2 β > 0 and α = 1. Then, γ = β > 0, and (SA.15) becomes

_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ (] _[v]_ [ −] _[p]_ [)˜] _[z]_ [ �][χ] _[e]_ [−][λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)][ −] [χ][0]         -         - (1 − _e_ −λ(˜ _z_ )) _K_ α| _z_ ˜|, _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_, (SA.20)


which is the same as (SA.18) with _C_ 0(˜ _z_ ) = _K_ α| _z_ ˜|. Thus, we claim again that there exists a unique
γ-limiting equilibrium.
Case 1.3 β > 0 and α > 1. Then, γ = βθ/(θ + α − 1) < β, and (SA.15) becomes

_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ (] _[v]_ [ −] _[p]_ [)˜] _[z]_ [ −] _[K]_ [θ] _[K]_ [α][|] _[z]_ [˜][|][θ][+][α][,] _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_ . (SA.21)

Since θ + α > 1, it is clear that _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [) above has a unique maximum point ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [)][ ∈] [R] _[v]_ [, and so]
there exists a unique γ-limiting equilibrium.
Case 2 γ = 1/2 ≤ βθ/(θ + α − 1) ≤ β.
Case 2.1 β = γ = 1/2. In this case, we have α = 1, and based on Assumption 6.1 conditions (i) and
(iii), observe that for some constant _K_ α _[v]_ [∈] [R][,]


_C_ 0( _z_ ) ∼ _K_ α| _z_ | + _K_ α _[v]_ [,] as | _z_ | →∞. (SA.22)


Indeed, when _v_ = 1, _C_ 0( _z_ ) − _K_ α _z_ is still convex and _C_ 0( _z_ ) − _K_ α _z_ = _o_ ( _z_ ) as _z_ →∞, and so the only
possibility is that _C_ 0( _z_ ) − _K_ α _z_ is constant when _z_ - 0 is large. The same idea goes for _v_ = 0.
With this observation, (SA.15) specializes to

_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ �][χ] _[e]_ [−][λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)][ −] [χ][0]        - _Q_ 1( ˜ _Z_ γ∗ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ −] [(1][ −] _[e]_ [−][λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)][)] _[K]_ [α][|] _[z]_ [˜][|][,] _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_, (SA.23)


which is a special case of (6.1) with _N_ = 1 and _C_ 0( _z_ ) = _K_ α| _z_ |. Thus, by assertion (i), a γ-limiting
equilibrium exists.
Case 2.2 γ = 1/2 = βθ/(θ + α − 1) < β. Then, (SA.15) becomes

_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =] _[ Q]_ [1][( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ −] _[K]_ [θ] _[K]_ [α][|] _[z]_ [˜][|][θ][+][α][,] _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_ .


Adapting the analysis in the proof of assertion (i), one can easily check that in this case, the condition
(B.9) becomes (using _z_ instead of ˜ _z_ ):


_F_ 0 [1][(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ =][ −][Φ][¯] [1][(][ζ][)][ −] _[z]_ [ ¯][Φ][′] 1 [(][ζ][)][ +] _[ K]_ [θ] _[K]_ [α][(][θ][ +][ α][)][|] _[z]_ [|][θ][+][α][−][1][,] _z_ < 0.


Since θ + α > 1, then clearly,

_z_ lim↗0 _[F]_ 0 [1][(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ =][ −][Φ][¯] [1][(][ζ][)][ <][ 0][,] _z_ →−∞lim _[F]_ 0 [1][(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ =][ ∞][,] ∂ _zF_ 0 [1][(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [)][ <][ 0][.]


Thus, _F_ [1]
0 [(][ζ][;] _[ z]_ [) has a unique zero][ z][0][(][ζ][)][ <][ 0. Also, it is clear that][ z][0][(][ζ][)][ ≥−][Φ][¯] [1][(][ζ][)][/][Φ][ ¯] [′] 1 [(][ζ][). By (][B.22][),]
we have limζ→∞ z0(ζ) = 0. Moreover, with limζ↘0 Φ [¯] 1(ζ) = 1 and limζ↘0 Φ [¯] [′] 1 [(][ζ][)][ =][ 0, we easily see]
that limζ↘0 z0(ζ) = − [�] _K_ θ _K_ α(θ+α) [�][1][/][(][θ][+][α][−][1)] < 0. In particular, this implies that, for z1(ζ) = ζ +z0(ζ),


lim lim (SA.24)
ζ↘0 [z][1][(][ζ][)][ <][ 0][,] ζ→∞ [z][1][(][ζ][)][ =][ ∞][.]

On the other hand, the condition (B.23) becomes


_G_ [1] 1 [(][ζ][)][ =][ −][�][Φ][ˆ] [1][(][ζ][)][ −] [1][�] [−] [z][1][(][ζ][) ˆ][Φ][′] 1 [(][ζ][)][ −] _[K]_ [θ] _[K]_ [α][(][θ][ +][ α][)][|][z][1][(][ζ][)][|][θ][+][α][−][1][.] (SA.25)


By (SA.24), there exists ζ > [˘] 0 such that z1(ζ [˘] ) = 0, and z1(ζ) > 0 for all ζ > ζ [˘] . By (SA.25) and
(SA.24), it is also clear that _G_ [1]
1 [(˘][ζ][)][ >][ 0 and lim][ζ][→∞] _[G]_ [1] 1 [(][ζ][)][ =][ −∞][, and so there exists][ ζ][∗] [>][ ˘][ζ][ such that]
_G_ [1]
1 [(][ζ][∗][)][ =][ 0. Therefore, it follows from the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem][ 4.1][ assertion]
(i) that, upon setting _Z_ [˜] γ [∗] [:][=][ (][z][0][(][ζ][∗][)][,][ z][1][(][ζ][∗][)), ( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][,] _[ P]_ [1][( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][;][ ·][)][�] [is a][ γ][-limiting equilibrium.]
Case 2.3 γ = 1/2 < βθ/(θ + α − 1) ≤ β. Then, (SA.15) reduces to _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =] _[ Q]_ [1][( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [) for]
_z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_, which has been analyzed in Case 2 in the proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (ii), so there exists a
γ-limiting equilibrium.


Step 2 We now prove the “only if” direction. Assuming that there is a γ-limiting equilibrium
( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][,][ ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [), our goal is to prove that][ γ][ satisfies (][6.5][). Notably, the limit (][SA.16][) is used when][ γ][ ≥] [β][,]
while (SA.17) is used when γ < β, and so we may exclude the cases (γ ≥ β, γ > 0, α > 1) and
βθ/(θ + α − 1) < γ < β. Now, if βθ/(θ + α − 1) < γ, then by the second excluded case, we have γ ≥ β,
which by the first excluded case further implies α = 1. Hence, we can focus on the following two
cases:
βθ βθ
γ ≤ or α = 1, γ > β = (SA.26)
θ + α − 1 [≤] [β] θ + α − 1 [.]


Case 3 γ < 1/2. In the second case of (SA.26), with _P_ [˜] [∗] γ [=] _[ p]_ [, (][SA.15][) gives]


_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 1)][ =][ −][χ][0] _[z]_ [˜][ (1][ −] _[p]_ [)][ −] _[K]_ [α][|] _[z]_ [˜][|][ =][ −][�][χ][0][(1][ −] _[p]_ [)][ +] _[ K]_ [α]         - _z_ ˜, _z_ ˜ > 0,


which has no maximum point in (0, ∞), and so we must have the first case of (SA.26), but if γ <
βθ/(θ + α − 1) ≤ β, then (SA.15) becomes _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ ˜] _[z]_ [ (] _[v]_ [ −] _[p]_ [), with no maximum point in][ R] _[v]_
either. Thus, it can only be that γ = βθ/(θ + α − 1), which verifies (6.5) because γ < 1/2 here.


Case 4 γ = 1/2. Suppose βθ/(θ + α − 1) < 1/2 = γ. Then, we have the second case of (SA.26), and
(SA.15) becomes
_J_ ˜∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ −][χ][0] _[Q]_ [1][( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ −] _[K]_ [α][|] _[z]_ [˜][|][,] _z_ ˜ ∈ R _v_ .

Note that _Q_ 1( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ >][ 0 for ˜] _[z]_ [ �] [0. Then, ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ <][ 0 for ˜] _[z]_ [ �] [0, while lim] _[z]_ [˜][→][0] _[J]_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ 0]
clearly, which means that _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [;][ ·][,] _[ v]_ [) has no maximum point in][ R][ \ {][0][}][. Therefore, we must have]
βθ/(θ + α − 1) ≥ 1/2 = γ, verifying (6.5).

Case 5 γ > 1/2. We consider two subcases. Again, we write _z_ [∗] γ [:][=][ ( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][ +][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1))][/][2.]
Case 5.1 _z_ [∗] γ [≥] [0. Note that in this case, for] _[ v]_ [ =][ 0,][ −][(][1][{] _[z]_ [˜][>] _[z]_ [∗] γ [}] [+][ 1][{] _[z]_ [˜][=] _[z]_ [∗] γ [}][/][2)][ =][ 0 for all ˜] _[z]_ [ <][ 0. Then,]

Case 5.2 _z_ [∗] γ [<][ 0. In this case, for] _[ v]_ [ =][ 1, 1] [−] [(][1][{] _[z]_ [˜][>] _[z]_ γ [∗] [}] [+] [1][{] _[z]_ [˜][=] _[z]_ [∗] γ [}][/][2)][ =][ 1][{] _[z]_ [˜][<] _[z]_ [∗] γ [}] [+] [1][{] _[z]_ [˜][=] _[z]_ [∗] γ [}][/][2][ =][ 0 for all ˜] _[z]_ [ >][ 0.]
Then, _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [( ˜] _[P]_ [∗] γ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,][ 1) has the same expression as in (][SA.27][) except with ˜] _[z]_ [ >][ 0, which results in the same]
violation. Thus, we conclude that no γ-limiting equilibrium exists in the case γ > 1/2. 

**Proof of Theorem SA.1 assertion (iii).** Let Assumption 6.1 hold; by (6.5), let γ = βθ/(θ + α − 1) <
1/2. We proceed as in the proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (iii), particularly focusing on the case _v_ = 0.

Step 1 Let us note that in (SA.14), the zero _ZN_ [∗] [(0) of the function] _[ F]_ 0 _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1)][ −] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0);][ ·][) satisfies]
_z_ [⋄] < _Z_ [∗]
_N_ [(0)][ <][ 0, where] _[ z]_ [⋄] [≡] _[z]_ [⋄] 0 [is the unique zero of] _[ g]_ [1][,] _[N]_ [ defined in (][B.9][). Write ˜] _[z]_ 0 _[N]_ [:][=] _[ N]_ [−][γ] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0) and]
_z_ ˆ0 _[N]_ [:][=] _[ N]_ [−][β] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0). By (][B.24][) and the subsequent arguments, we have that][ |] _[z]_ [ˆ] 0 _[N]_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [1][ for some] _[ K]_ [1][ >][ 0;]
in particular, when γ = β, ˜ _z_ _[N]_
0 [=][ ˆ] _[z]_ 0 _[N]_ [is also bounded in] _[ N]_ [ by] _[ K]_ [1][.]
Next, we justify the boundedness of ˜ _z_ _[N]_
0 [in the case][ γ < β][, which is recalled to imply][ α >][ 1]
and γ > 0. Denote as before ζ _N_ [∗] [:][=] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1)][ −] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0), and note that] _[ F]_ 0 _[N]_ [(][ζ] _N_ [∗] [,] _[ Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0))][ =][ 0, where] _[ F]_ 0 _[N]_ [is]
defined in (SA.14). From the arguments after (B.10), we see that _g_ 2, _N_ is decreasing in ( _z_ [⋄], 0) with
lim _z_ ↗0 _g_ 2, _N_ ( _z_ ) = 0, so _g_ 2, _N_ ( _z_ ) > 0 for _z_ ∈ ( _z_ [⋄], 0), and in particular _g_ 2, _N_ ( _ZN_ [∗] [(0))][ >][ 0. Recall (][SA.8][) and]
note that −λ [′] _N_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0))] _[C]_ [0][(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0))][ >][ 0,][ −][(] _[e]_ [λ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0))] −1) _C_ 0 [′] [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0))][ >][ 0. Also note that][ λ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0))][ =][ λ][(ˆ] _[z]_ 0 _[N]_ [)]
and λ [′] _N_ [(] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(0))][ =] _[ N]_ [−][β][λ][′][(ˆ] _[z]_ 0 _[N]_ [). Since for][ ζ >][ 0, 0][ <][ ¯][Φ] _[N]_ [(][ζ][)][ <][ 1 and ¯][Φ][′] _N_ [(][ζ][)][ >][ 0, by (][SA.14][) and (][B.9][),]

for some constant _K_ 2 > 0, where we have used the crucial fact that | _z_ ˆ0 _[N]_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [1][. Moreover, by As-]
sumption 6.1 condition (ii), we have _K_ 3 := sup _z_ ∈[− _K_ 1,0) | _z_ | [θ][−][1] /|λ [′] ( _z_ )| < ∞, and so |λ [′] (ˆ _z_ 0 _[N]_ [)][| ≥|] _[z]_ [ˆ] 0 _[N]_ [|][θ][−][1][/] _[K]_ [3][.]

where the last equality is due to γ = βθ/(θ + α − 1). This immediately implies that | _z_ ˜0 _[N]_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [0][ for some]
_K_ 0 > 0.
Furthermore, in this case (B.25) generalizes into

and in the same manner we can show that ˜ _z_ 1 _[N]_ [:][=] _[ N]_ [−][γ] _[Z]_ _N_ [∗] [(1) is also bounded by] _[ K]_ [0][.]

Step 2 In this step we prove the uniform convergence of _Fv_ _[N]_ [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜][ζ][;] _[ N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜][), for 0][ <][ ˜][ζ][ ≤] [2] _[K]_ [0] [and ˜] _[z]_ [ ∈] [R] _[v]_
with | _z_ ˜| ≤ _K_ 0, and we shall only do it for _v_ = 0. The case _v_ = 1 can be proved analogously. We
consider three cases, corresponding to, respectively, Case 1.1, Case 1.2, and Case 1.3 in the proof of
assertion (ii).

Case 1 γ = β = 0. Recalling (SA.14) and (SA.19), we have

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


where _IN_ is exactly the (absolute) difference indicated in (B.26), with | _IN_ | ≤ _KN_ [2][γ][−][1] . Moreover, from
(SA.8) we see that _AN_ ( _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜) = _A_ 1(˜ _z_ ) when γ = β = 0 or γ = β > 0 and _C_ 0( _z_ ) = _K_ α| _z_ |. Thus,

Case 2 γ = β > 0 and α = 1. This is the same as Case 1, with the specialization _C_ 0( _z_ ) = _K_ α| _z_ |, and
thus (SA.30) remains true.

Case 3. β > 0 and α > 1, so that γ = βθ/(θ + α − 1) < β. In this case, recalling (SA.21),

Step 3 We now prove (SA.1). First, in Case 1 above, by (SA.9) we see _A_ [′]
1 [(˜] _[z]_ [)][ ≤] [0, ˜] _[z]_ [ <][ 0. Then,]
based on Step 3 in the proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (iii) as well as (SA.19), we have ∂ _z_ ˜ _J_ [˘] ∞ [γ] [(˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0)][ ≤]
_p_ χλ [′] (˜ _z_ ) ≤− _p_ χ|λ [′] ( _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][/][2)][|][, for all ˜] _[z]_ [ ≤] _[Z]_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][/][2. Thus, by (][SA.30][) and exactly the same arguments as]
in Step 3 in the proof of Theorem 4.1 assertion (iii), we obtain | _z_ ˜0 _[N]_ [−] _[Z]_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][| ≤] _[KN]_ [2][γ][−][1][. Similarly, the]
same estimate holds for Case 2 above.
For Case 3 above, by (SA.31),


               ∂ _z_ ˜ _J_ [˘] ∞ [γ] [(˜] _[z]_ [,][ 0)][ =][ ∂] _z_ ˜     - _p_ + _K_ θ _K_ α(θ + α)| _z_ ˜| [θ][+][α][−][1][�] = − _K_ θ _K_ α(θ + α)(θ + α − 1)| _z_ ˜| [θ][+][α][−][2]

2 [1] _[Z]_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][,]



from where similar arguments and (SA.32) yield the last estimate in (SA.1).
Finally, the case _v_ = 1 can be proved similarly. Additionally, the same estimate in (4.4) in the
setting of Theorem 4.1 stands – by the exact same arguments in its proof. 

**Proof of Theorem SA.1 assertion (iv).** We follow the proof of Theorem 4.2 presented in Appendix
C. In Definition 4.1, first, (4.7) is justified based on Theorem 4.2 with ϵ = ϵ _N_ = _KN_ [γ][−][1][/][2], so it suffices
to verify (4.6) with some appropriate ϵ. To this end, note that by (6.1),


_N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜, _v_ ) = _N_ [−][γ] _e_ [−][λ][(] _[N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][)] ( _v_  - _p_ ) _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜ − _N_ [−][γ] (1 − _e_ [−][λ][(] _[N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][)] ) _C_ 0( _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜)

= ( _v_           - _p_ )˜ _z_ (χ _e_ [−][λ][(] _[N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][)]           - χ0) − (1 − _e_ [−][λ][(] _[N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][)] ) _N_ [−][γ] _C_ 0( _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜), _z_ ∈ R _v_ . (SA.33)


Since, again, γ = βθ/(θ + α − 1) < 1/2 and _P_ [˜] [∗] γ [=] _[ p]_ [, we turn to the two cases in Step 2 in the above]
proof of assertion (iii).


In Case 1, namely γ = β = 0, (SA.18) gives that


_N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜, _v_ ) = ( _v_     - _p_ )˜ _z_ (χ _e_ [−][λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)]     - χ0) − (1 − _e_ [−][λ][(˜] _[z]_ [)] ) _C_ 0(˜ _z_ ) = _J_ [˜] ∞ [γ] [(] _[p]_ [;] _[ z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][.]


Then, by Definition 3.1,


_N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _N_ [γ][ ˜] _Z_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ ˜] _[J]_ ∞ [γ] [(] _[p]_ [; ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(] _[v]_ [)][,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ sup] _J_ ˜∞ [γ] [(] _[p]_ [; ˜] _[z]_ [,] _[ v]_ [)][ =][ sup] _N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _z_, _v_ ),
_z_ ˜∈R _v_ _z_ ∈R _v_


which implies (4.6) with ϵ = 0. Therefore, combined with (4.7), ϵ = ϵ _N_ = _KN_ [γ][−][1][/][2] . The same holds
in Case 2: γ = β > 0 and α = 1.
It remains to consider Case 3, namely β > 0 and α > 1. We will verify (4.6) only for _v_ = 0; the
case _v_ = 1 can be considered similarly. Recall (SA.33) and denote


_J_ ˘ _N_ ( _p_ ; ˜ _z_, 0) := _e_ [−][λ][(] _[N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][)] ∂ _z_ ˜� _N_ [−][γ] _JN_ ( _p_ ; _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜, 0)� = − _p_ [�] χ − χ0 _e_ [λ][(] _[N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][)][�]

+ _p_ χ _N_ [γ][−][β] _z_ ˜λ [′] ( _N_ [γ][−][β] _z_ ˜) − _N_ [−][β] λ [′] ( _N_ [γ][−][β] _z_ ˜) _C_ 0( _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜) − ( _e_ [λ][(] _[N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][)]   - 1) _C_ 0 [′] [(] _[N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜][)][,] _z_ ˜ < 0, (SA.34)


with
lim lim lim _J_ ˘ _N_ ( _p_ ; ˜ _z_, 0) = − _p_ < 0.
_z_ ˜↘0 _[J][N]_ [(] _[p]_ [;] _[ N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜][,][ 0)][ =][ 0][,] _z_ ˜→−∞ _[J][N]_ [(] _[p]_ [;] _[ N]_ [γ] _[z]_ [˜][,][ 0)][ =][ −∞][,] _z_ ˜↘0

By the first and third limits, it is clear that sup _z_ ˜<0 _JN_ ( _p_ ; _N_ [γ] _z_ ˜, 0) > 0. Then, by the first two limits
above, we see that _JN_ ( _p_ ; ·, 0) has a maximum point ˜ _z_ [∗] _N_ [<][ 0, which satisfies ˘] _[J][N]_ [(] _[p]_ [; ˜] _[z]_ [∗] _N_ [,][ 0)][ =][ 0.]

_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


We claim that | _z_ ˜ [∗] _N_ [| ≤] _[K]_ [0][ for some] _[ K]_ [0][ >][ 0. Indeed, note that all three terms in the second line of]
(SA.34) are positive. Then, denoting ˆ _z_ [∗] _N_ [:][=] _[ N]_ [γ][−][β] _[z]_ [˜][∗] _N_ [, we must have]

which is (SA.28) with _K_ 2 = _p_ χ. Then, employing the arguments following (SA.28), we obtain the
desired boundedness of ˜ _z_ [∗] _N_ [.]

assuming that _D_ ( _z_ ) ∼ _KD_ | _z_ | [θ] _[D]_ as | _z_ | ↘ 0, with _KD_ - 0 and θ _D_ ≥ 1. Note that since |erfc _x_ | < 1, ∀ _x_ ∈ R,
the function _D_ is required to be bounded by 1, or else (SB.1) is not real-valued. Moreover, if _D_ is

Since the function erfc((¯ _y_ + _z_ )/ 2) + erfc((¯ _y_ - _z_ )/ 2), _z_ - 0, is strictly increasing, (SB.2) is clearly

It follows from the oddity of λ [′] that |λ [′] ( _z_ )| ≥ _bD_ ( _z_ ), _z_ - 0, with _b_ = 2¯ _ye_ [−] _[y]_ [¯][2][/][2] / 2π. Therefore, for

_D_ ( _z_ ) = _KD_ | _z_ | [θ] _[D]_, we have |λ [′] ( _z_ )| ≥ _bD_ ( _z_ ) = _bKD_ | _z_ | [θ] _[D]_, _z_ - 0. Additionally, with _D_ [′] (0) and _D_ [′′] (0) both
finite, a further expansion (SB.2) around _z_ = 0 directly shows that λ [′] ( _z_ ) = λ [′] (0) + _O_ (| _z_ |) as _z_ → 0.

due to _C_ 0( _z_ ) = | _z_ | as used in (SA.20) (with _K_ α = 1). With λ( _z_ ) = | _z_ ˜| further, and recalling χ = 1, by
(SA.19) and (SA.8) we find that

Then, _x_ 0 = W0(3 _e_ /4), and so ˜ _z_ 0 = W0(3 _e_ /4) − 1. Similarly, for _v_ = 1, (SB.4) is equivalent to

Then, _x_ 1 = W0(3 _e_ /5), and so ˜ _z_ 1 = 1 − W0(3 _e_ /5). 
**Details for Example 6.2.** With γ = β = 0, we have _P_ [˜] [∗]

strategy amounts to maximizing the limiting objective functions in (SA.18), with χ = 1 and χ0 = 0.
By plugging in the given expressions of λ and _C_ 0 and by straightforward calculations, we obtain

Suppose that there exists ¯ _z_ - 0 such that _D_ ( _z_ ) = 1 for | _z_ | ≥ _z_ ¯, meaning that as the insider increases his

recalling that _V_ =d. Bernoulli( _p_ ). Similarly, for (5.1.3) and (5.1.4), note that _XN_ =d. Normal( _N_ µ, _N_ (σ2 −

For the calibration, by writing _Z_ = _N_ [γ][ ˜] _Z_ γ [∗] [in terms of (][5.1.5][) and using the symmetry][ |][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(0)][|][ =]
_Z_ ˜γ [∗][(1)][ >][ 0, the equations (][5.1.2][), (][5.1.3][), and (][5.1.4][) can be significantly simplified, permitting explicit]
solutions. In particular,




[1] ~~√~~

2 [erfc] [(] _[N]_ [γ][σ][×][a][)(] _[x]_ [−][1)][−] _[N]_ [µ]

(5.1.2) = _N_ [γ] σ × a, (5.1.3) = _N_ µ + _N_ [γ] σ × a, (5.1.4) = [1]



.
2 _N_ (σ [2] −µ [2] )



For conciseness, let us denote the average insider share volume, the average total share volume,
and the median insider-to-total volume ratio from data by i, v, and r, respectively, and recall that

~~�~~
a = 1 − 2W0( ~~[√]~~ _e_ ~~χ~~ 0/(2χ)), with χ0 = χ − 1.

The first calibration condition is due to (5.1.2) and (5.1.5),


_N_ [γ] σ × a = i. (SB.5)


Similarly, from (5.1.3) we have the second calibration condition,


_N_ µ + _N_ [γ] σ × a = v. (SB.6)


The third calibration condition is obtained in the same manner by evaluating (5.1.4). In particular,
since erfc − 1 is an odd function, we obtain


_N_ [γ] σ × a × (r [−][1]           - 1) − _N_ µ = 0. (SB.7)


Notably, in calibration experiment I, the average total trading volume is associated with the standard error 10,246, respectively, as reported by Meulbroek (1992). Since there are a total of 588
insider trading episodes included in the data set, a reasonable estimate for the standard deviation of
the trading volume, given independence between insider trades and normal trades, is


~~�~~
s = 10246 [2] × 588 ≈ 248452. (SB.8)


48


_Ma, Xia, and Zhang_


Thus, the additional condition _N_ (σ [2] - µ [2] ) = s [2] can be used along with (SB.5) and (SB.6) to obtain
an estimate for the parameter µ > 0, namely







s [4] + 4σ [2] × (v − i) [2] - s [2]

, (SB.9)
2 × (v − i)



µˆ =



which we simply take as µ.
Taking (SB.9) as given, the preceding calibration conditions are easily solvable by elementary
means. In particular, from (SB.5) and (SB.6) we obtain


_N_ ˆ = [v][ −] [i] γˆ = log σ×i a ; (SB.10)

µ [,] log _N_ [ˆ]


if (SB.7) is used instead of (SB.6),


_N_ ˆ = [i][ ×][ (1][ −] [r][)], γˆ = log σ×i a ; (SB.11)

µ × r log _N_ [ˆ]


when only (SB.6) and (SB.7) are used, we have




[ −] [r][)], γˆ = log σ [v][×] × [r]

µ log _N_ [ˆ]



_N_ ˆ = [v][ ×][ (1][ −] [r][)]



σ×a . (SB.12)
log _N_ [ˆ]



According to the statistics shown in Table 1, setting i = 9819, v = 113909, r = 0.113, σ = 1000,
and χ ∈{1, 2, 3} and evaluating (SB.9) verifies µ = 1.68625, and subsequently evaluating (SB.9),
(SB.10), (SB.11), and (SB.12) gives rise to Table 2 for calibration experiment I.


In the same vein, for calibration experiment II, Table 5 is a result of evaluating (SB.11) with
i = 4900, r = 0.026, µ = 1.68625, σ = 1000, and χ ∈{1, 2, 3}, based on the information in Table 4.
Moreover, the formula (5.1.1) follows directly from the law of total probability, E[ _B_ ( _Z_ ( _V_ ))] =
E[1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[Z]_ [(] _[V]_ [))] ]. Then, using that | _Z_ [˜] γ [∗][(0)][|][ =][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1)][ >][ 0, the prosecution probability implied by the]
equilibrium is
1 − _e_ [−][λ] _[N]_ [(] _[N]_ [γ][ ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1))] = 1 − _e_ [−][λ][( ˜] _[Z]_ γ [∗][(1))], (SB.13)


which upon setting γ = β becomes independent of _N_ and γ. Putting the solved finite-population and
limiting strategy values from Table 6 into (5.1.1) (with _Z_ = _ZN_ [∗] [) and (][B.7][), respectively, gives the last]
column of Table 6.
