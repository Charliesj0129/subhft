The formation and entrapment of gas bubbles during solidification significantly influence the
microstructure and mechanical properties of materials, from metallic alloys to ice. While gas segregation at the solidification front is well-documented, the real-time dynamics of bubble nucleation,
growth, and engulfment-and their dependence on solidification velocity-remain poorly understood.
In this study, we use in situ cryo-confocal fluorescence microscopy to investigate the coupled gasbubble dynamics at the solidification front of carbonated water, systematically varying the solidification velocity ( _V_ = 1 _−_ 20 _µm/s_ ) while maintaining a constant thermal gradient ( _G_ = 15 _K/mm_ ).
Our experiments reveal that bubble nucleation is governed by a characteristic nucleation time, which
emerges from the interplay between gas diffusion ahead of the front, nucleation kinetics, and bubble
growth, all competing with the advancing solidification front. These results allow us to estimate the
critical gas concentration for bubbles nucleation in carbonated water. These results offer a detailed
understanding of the mechanisms controlling bubble nucleation and entrapment during solidification at constant thermal gradient. They contribute to the development of strategies to control
bubble formation in industrial processes where the presence of bubbles can either be detrimental or
intentionally harnessed.


**I.** **INTRODUCTION**


The occurrence of bubbles during solidification processes is of considerable significance across various disciplines,
including environmental sciences with studies on ice cores [1], lake ice [2], and hailstones [3], as well as in engineering
domains such as metallurgy [4], crystal growth [5, 6], materials processing [7], and cryopreservation [8]. Bubbles
can contribute to the development of porosity in solidified materials, thus affecting their mechanical and functional
properties by altering their microstructure [9]. While porosity is typically regarded as a defect in solid materials,
a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and factors that lead to bubble entrapment by the solidification
front might facilitate its control, thus enhancing the properties of the resulting materials. Conversely, in applications
where porous materials are desired, an in-depth understanding of these mechanisms could enable the engineering of
materials with precisely controlled porosity characteristics, including the number, size, and morphology of trapped
bubbles [7]. Parameters such as the composition of the liquid, its temperature, the temperature gradient within the
system, and the solidification velocity are potential key factors influencing bubble entrapment.
During solidification objects residing within the liquid phase may either be pushed or engulfed by the solidification
front [10–12]. The nature of their interaction with the solidification front is significantly influenced by the presence
of solutes and gases, particularly in proximity to the solidification front [13]. Indeed, during directional solidification,
solutes have a tendency to segregate at the solidification front, thereby establishing a concentration gradient between
the bulk liquid and the solidification front [14, 15]. This solute segregation at the interface results from their limited
solubility in the solid phase [16], and the effect is further exacerbated by the proximity of neighboring objects, which
perturb the local diffusion gradients.
The mathematical model formulated by Pohl [17] enables the prediction of solute and gas segregation profiles at
the solidification front as a function of factors such as solidification velocity, solute diffusivity, and solubility within
the liquid phase, assuming negligible diffusion within the solid phase, an absence of vaporization, and purely diffusive
transport within the liquid. Assuming the absence of convection in the liquid phase and negligible gas diffusion in
the solid, the variation in gas concentration during solidification can be estimated using the following equation :

where _t_ is the time, _D_ is the diffusion coefficient of the gas, _CL_ is the gas concentration at a distance _x_ from the
solidification front and _C_ 0 is the bulk gas concentration in the liquid far from the solidification front. The partition
coefficient _k_ is related to the solubility of the gas in the ice and is defined as the ratio of gas solubility in the solid phase
to the one in the liquid phase. The local segregation of solutes is especially critical for examining the morphology
of the solidification front, the occurrence of constitutional supercooling leading to the formation of premelted liquid
films [18, 19], as well as for understanding the behavior of objects in proximity to the front [13].

The continued segregation of gas at the solidification front can therefore lead to a marked increase in gas concentration, potentially exceeding the solubility limit within the liquid medium and eventually initiate bubble nucleation.
Classical nucleation theory [20–22] provides a theoretical framework for characterizing the emergence of new phases,
such as gas bubbles in supersaturated liquids. This theory postulates that random thermal fluctuations may exceed
the local free energy barrier required for nucleation [23], consequently allowing for the formation of bubbles. [24].
The classical nucleation theory enables the estimation of the likelihood that a nucleus will evolve into a stable bubble [25, 26], the theoretical nucleation rate [27, 28], and the critical nucleation concentration [24] within a given
system.

Throughout the process of solidification, the nucleation free energy barrier is primarily influenced by surface tension
and pressure differences, both of which depend on the temperature of the liquid and the concentration of gas. Although
the mechanisms responsible for bubble nucleation are well understood, the dynamics associated with bubble nucleation
during solidification are not well elucidated. Bubble nucleation may occur homogeneously, within the bulk of the
liquid in regions of gas enrichment, or heterogeneously, on a substrate such as the front of solidification itself [29].
Consequently, determining the critical nucleation concentration poses a challenge due to the significant variability in
values derived from distinct experimental measurements or theoretical predictions [29–31].

The dynamics of bubbles during solidification represent a complex process encompassing multiple mechanisms. _In_
_situ_ experimental investigations of bubble growth [31–35] and interactions with the solidification front [15, 36–42] have
been largely examined. Conversely, the study of bubble nucleation dynamics, an essential phase of bubble dynamics
during solidification, remains underexplored. The existing understanding of nucleation during solidification primarily
stems from theoretical modeling or post-solidification analysis, and inquiries into nucleation dynamics are notably
scarce in the literature. In numerous studies, experimental conditions during solidification, such as solidification
velocity and thermal gradient, were not consistently controlled, often varying throughout the process. Although these
approaches afford some understanding of nucleation phenomena, they are insufficient for probing nucleation dynamics
under strictly defined and constant conditions [15, 37, 40, 43].

Here we examine _in situ_ the dynamics of bubble nucleation during the directional solidification of carbonated
water using cryo-confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides precise control over both the solidification
velocity and the temperature gradient throughout the solidification process. A comprehensive examination was
conducted focusing on the number and location of bubble nucleation events, their growth and size, and their subsequent
engulfment by the solidification front. The analysis was performed under carefully controlled solidification velocities
and temperature gradients to evaluate the influence of these parameters on the coupled dynamics of these processes.


**II.** **MATERIALS & METHODS**


**A.** **Materials and sample preparation**


An aqueous fluorophore, Sulforhodamine B, was obtained from FluoTechnik, alongside a Sodastream Terra device
to facilitate the injection of carbon dioxide into water. The solutions were prepared by dissolving Sulforhodamine B
in distilled water, followed by stirring for approximately one minute, to obtain a 10 _[−]_ [5] _M_ solution. Carbon dioxide
was introduced into the solution by administering three one-second pulses using the Sodastream Terra device. Subsequently, the solution was immediately introduced into a rectangular Hele-Shaw cell via capillary action. This cell
comprised two glass slides (Menzel, thickness 0 _,_ 13 _−_ 0 _,_ 19 _mm_ ), held apart by two spacers composed of double-sided
adhesive tape, which maintained a consistent sample thickness of approximately 100 _µm_ . The cell was sealed on one
side with a plastic support (used to pull the sample through the temperature gradient) and on the opposite side with
nail polish to prevent both evaporation and leakage.

**B.** **Experimental setup and typical solidification parameters**


Unidirectional solidification experiments were conducted utilizing the experimental setup described previously [19]
and visualized through confocal fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1). The Hele-Shaw cell was positioned beneath the
microscope objective on two Peltier modules and was pulled through the temperature gradient at a constant velocity
by a stepper motor (Micos Pollux Drive stepper motor with VT-80 translation stage (PI, USA)). The temperature
gradient was established by two Peltier modules and managed with a TEC-1122 Dual Thermo Electric Cooling
Temperature Controller from Meerstetter Engineering, Switzerland. The stage was enhanced by enclosing it within
a Plexiglas box supplied with dry air to minimize humidity (typically between 5 and 10%) to avert condensation and
freezing on cold surfaces. This measure prevents potential friction with the sample and mitigates light scattering
caused by frost.


The control of solidification velocity and temperature gradient is achieved independently, enabling the preservation of the solidification front at a stationary position beneath the microscope objective. Freezing experiment were
conducted with velocities spanning from 1 to 20 _µm/s_, alongside a temperature gradient of 15 _[◦]_ _C/mm_ .


Figure 1. Experimental setup for cryo-confocal microscopy. A constant temperature gradient ∆ _T_ = _Th −_ _Tc_ is created between
the Peltier modules, specifically within the gap ( _d_ = 2 _mm_ ). The sample is translated through the temperature gradient at
a constant velocity _Vsf_, thereby inducing ice crystal growth at a velocity _Vsf_ . Consequently, the interface remains at a fixed
position within the observation frame. The samples possess a thickness of 100 _µm_, and _Tf_ denotes the liquid’s freezing point.
Due to differing thermal conductivities, the temperature gradient in the ice is greater than in the liquid. Within the study,
the reported magnitude of the temperature gradient ∆ _T_ corresponds to the temperature difference between the two Peltier
modules.


**C.** **Imaging**


Images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems SAS, Germany), equipped with a long working distance (2.2mm), non-immersive objective (Leica HC PL APO 10x/0.40 CS2),
to ensure an adequately large field of view and to minimize the influence of the microscope’s thermal mass on the
freezing process. A 488nm laser was employed for all experiments. Image acquisition was conducted in resonant mode
at a resolution of 512 _×_ 512 pixels (582 _×_ 582 _µm_ ), resulting in acquisition times ranging from 0.133s to 0.333s per
frame. A single photo-detector was utilized, operating between 500nm and 795nm, which corresponds to the emission
range of Sulforhodamine B when dissolved in water. Air bubbles do not fluoresce and thus appear black in the images,
akin to ice, which also appears black due to the negligible solubility of fluorophores in ice. Previous experiments have
demonstrated that Sulforhodamine B does not exhibit any significant impact on the freezing behavior of the system.

**III.** **RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**


**A.** **Experimental observations**


We conducted horizontal solidification experiments by displacing a Hele-Shaw cell filled with carbonated water,
at varying freezing velocities _Vsf_ . A representative series of time-lapse 2D confocal images illustrating the freezing
process is presented in figure 2A for _V_ = 20 _µm/s_ .
In the observational frame, the solidification front remains stationary, whereas in the sample’s reference frame,
the solidification front progresses through the medium at a velocity _Vsf_ . The ice appears black and the aqueous
solution pink. Bubbles nucleate near or at the solidification front within several seconds of freezing. This process is
attributed to the segregation of gas at the front, which results in a localized increase in gas concentration surpassing
the critical nucleation threshold under the given experimental conditions. The following images, from _t_ = 9 _s_ to
_t_ = 12 _s_, demonstrate that bubbles can experience an increase in size as a consequence of gas segregation and diffusion
or through the coalescence of adjacent bubbles. The transfer of gas between a bubble and the surrounding liquid is
regulated by the Laplace pressure, which is a function of the bubble’s curvature. The bubbles eventually interact with
the solidification front and undergo deformation during their engulfment ( _t_ = 16 _s_ and _t_ = 33 _s_ ). Mechanical stresses
acting on bubbles arise from the pushing effect of the solidification front. This mechanism has been described for solid
particles [44], and bubbles experience a similar effect [45]. After engulfment of the bubbles by the front ( _t_ = 44 _s_ ),
another cycle of gas segregation is initiated ( _t_ = 57 _s_ ), until the next nucleation event.
The deformation experienced by a bubble during its interaction with the front is dictated by the equilibrium between
gas segregation and diffusion at the solidification front, as well as the solidification velocity _Vsf_ . This equilibrium
can result in diverse morphologies of bubbles entrapped within the solid; some bubbles retain their spherical shape,
some others undergo minor deformation resulting in egg-like shapes, and some are stretched during the interaction to
become cylindrical.
The deformation of these cylindrical bubbles and the influence of solidification velocity, gas concentration, pressure,
and mass transport of gas have been thoroughly examined in previous studies [7, 32, 38]. Moreover, models have been
formulated to predict the formation of such bubbles [40, 41]. Although a sharp transition from circular to cylindrical
bubbles was predicted [40], we did not observe it here. In our steady state regime, with a constant front velocity and
constant temperature gradient, there is a continuous transition from circular to cylindrical bubbles. The stability,
and thus the time that cylindrical bubbles remains at the front, increases as the front velocity decreases. Cylindrical
bubbles persist longer (up to 1000 _s_ and more) at reduced solidification velocities (1 _−_ 2 _µm/s_, with some observed to
grow laterally when the solidification velocity _Vsf_ is below 5 _µm/s_ (Figure 2C). Conversely, at elevated solidification
velocities _Vsf_ (5 _−_ 20 _µm/s_ ), cylindrical bubbles may still form; however, they are smaller and become engulfed by
the solidification front shortly after formation (Figure 2B). This is attributed to the inadequate gas diffusion from the
surrounding liquid to the exposed tip of the cylindrical bubbles at high solidification velocities.
Our focus now shifts to the dynamics of bubble nucleation.


**B.** **Average nucleation rates**


We first examine the impact of solidification velocity _Vsf_ on the average rate of bubble nucleation, quantitatively
expressed as the number of bubbles formed per second (Figure 3). This analysis currently focuses for now solely
on the incidence of bubble nucleation events, deliberately excluding any subsequent phenomena such as changes in
bubble size, growth kinetics, or interactions with adjacent bubbles. The freezing front velocity _Vsf_ is systematically
increased from 1 _µm/s_ to 20 _µm/s_ . At each specified velocity, the solidification process continues long enough to
collect a sufficient number of bubbles, typically between 20 and 70 for velocities in the range of 8 _−_ 20 _µm/s_ . At
lower velocities, the number of bubbles remained very limited—typically fewer than 10 because of the small number
of bubble nucleation. By using a single sample with a gradually increasing or decreasing solidification velocity, it is
ensured that any observed variations in nucleation behavior are attributed to velocity changes rather than fluctuations
in the initial gas concentration. Additionally, an alternative set of measurements is conducted by reducing the velocity
from 20 _µm/s_ to 1 _µm/s_ .
We observe that the average nucleation rate increases with the solidification velocity for both the increasing or
decreasing ramps. The enhanced nucleation rate observed at higher solidification velocities is consistent with an
increased segregation of dissolved gases at the solidification front. Faster solidification front velocities accelerate local
gas enrichment, making it more likely for the critical nucleation concentration _C_ _[∗]_ to be reached within a shorter
timescale.
Furthermore, nucleation rates demonstrate consistency and reproducibility across both velocity ramp protocols.
A notable discrepancy is observed for _V_ = 20 _µm/s_, wherein the nucleation rate observed during the decreasing

corresponds to the ice phase, whereas the upper, lighter region corresponds to the liquid phase. Bubbles, being non-fluorescent,
appear as dark regions within the liquid. (A) The time-lapse sequences display typical 2D cryo-confocal images demonstrating
the nucleation, interaction, and engulfment of bubbles during the solidification process. Velocity of the solidification front
_Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ . The bubble formation in these images is ascribed to nucleation induced by gas accumulation at the advancing
solidification front, attributed to gas segregation. (B), (C) The sequences also illustrate the formation and evolution of cylindrical bubbles at the solidification front during solidification for _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ (B) and _Vsf_ = 1 _µm/s_ (C).


velocity ramp is markedly lower than that in the increasing velocity ramp. This inconsistency is likely due to the
transient period necessary for the system to attain a steady state, coupled with the segregation of dissolved gas at
the solidification front and the attainment of the critical nucleation concentration _C_ _[∗]_ . In the experiments involving
increasing velocities, the gas segregation is pre-established from the onset when the velocity transitions from 18 _µm/s_
to 20 _µm/s_ . Conversely, in the decreasing velocity ramps, it is probable that the steady state is not achieved for the
initial velocity examined (20 _µm/s_ ).
To a first approximation, we observed no influence of the front shape (planar or cellular) on the formation, growth,
or engulfment of bubbles. With a cellular front, gas-enriched liquid is trapped between the cells, which might suggest
a lower gas concentration at the front compared to a planar front. In principle, this could influence the cascade of
bubble-related events at the front. However, since the front morphology is primarily determined by the front velocity,

velocity.


we cannot independently control both parameters and therefore cannot draw any conclusion on this point. Although
a sharp transition from a planar to a cellular solidification front might be expected, we did not observe it here. For
_Vsf <_ 5 _µm/s_ and _Vsf >_ 15 _µm/s_, the solidification front remains systematically planar and cellular, respectively.
Instead of an abrupt change, a continuous evolution from planar to cellular solidification is observed, with both
morphologies coexisting for intermediate velocities 8 _< Vsf <_ 13 _µm/s_ .


**C.** **Dynamics of bubble nucleation**


We now focus on the dynamics of bubble nucleation as influenced by _Vsf_ under experimental conditions where the
solidification velocity _Vsf_ is maintained constant throughout the entirety of a given sample. In each captured image,
the count of bubble nucleation events occurring within the field of view is recorded, and their cumulative total is
evaluated over the duration of solidification for various solidification velocities (Figure 4).
The slopes of these curves represent the average nucleation rate of gas bubbles for each specified solidification
velocity _Vsf_, which concurs with the data presented in figure 3. Repeated experiments performed at solidification
velocities of 10 _µm/s_ and 15 _µm/s_ consistently yielded convergent results, thereby verifying the reproducibility of
the observed nucleation dynamics under controlled conditions. These findings confirm the reliability of the protocol
employed for sample preparation and freezing. The rate of nucleation increases with the solidification velocity _Vsf_ . For
example, at _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_, 30 bubbles nucleated after 2968s, in contrast to 166 bubbles after 2430s for _Vsf_ = 10 _µm/s_,
186 bubbles after 930s for _Vsf_ = 15 _µm/s_, and 161 bubbles after 600s for _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ .
Across the various solidification velocities investigated, the cumulative number of nucleated bubbles increases in a
stepwise manner over time. The duration of the observed plateaus depends on the solidification velocity, with plateau
durations noted as 380 _±_ 130s for _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_, 131 _±_ 43s for _Vsf_ = 10 _µm/s_, 58 _±_ 23s for _Vsf_ = 15 _µm/s_, and 40 _±_
11s for _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ .
This analysis reveals that the rate of bubble nucleation is non-uniform during the solidification process and occurs in
discrete steps. These steps are governed by two alternating periods: (1) a lag period, _tplateau_, in which gas accumulates
at the solidification front, as indicated by the plateau observed in the nucleation curves, and (2) a burst nucleation
phase, characterized by the simultaneous nucleation of numerous bubbles, corresponding to the steep increase in the
curve. A reduction in gas segregation time preceding bubble nucleation is observed with an increase in the solidification
velocity _Vsf_ . This phenomenon arises because the segregation of dissolved gas at the solidification front becomes more
significant at higher solidification velocities. Consequently, the magnitude of each nucleation event, as evidenced by
the simultaneous nucleation of multiple bubbles, is also augmented.
We now re-examine the data presented in figure 4 to determine the total proportion of the field of view occupied

experiments were performed at solidification velocities of _Vsf_ = 10 _µm/s_ and _Vsf_ = 15 _µm/s_ to validate the reproducibility of
the measurements. The plateau length indicates the lag period _tplateau_ between successive bubble nucleation events.

by the bubbles in the liquid region. This analysis, depicted in figure 5, allows for the differentiation between the step
of bubble nucleation and growth—resulting in an increase in the area occupied by the bubbles—and the subsequent
step where they are engulfed by the front, leading to a reduction in the interfacial area. This method utilizes 2D
fluorescence microscopy images, applying a threshold to identify and quantify the area occupied by the bubbles in
the liquid region. The results, as a function of the duration of directional solidification corresponding to solidification
velocities _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_ and 10 _µm/s_, are presented in figure 5.
At all velocities, successive peaks of varying amplitudes are observed, characterized by rapid expansions of the space

Figure 6. Temporal evolution of the area occupied by bubbles during the stages of nucleation, growth, and engulfment
throughout the solidification process. The peaks identified in the global measurements of the bubble-occupied area during
solidification were extracted and normalized relative to their maximum values. The boundaries for each peak were determined
as the times at which the measured area decreased to below 20% of its maximum. Different colors in the graphs represent distinct
peaks, each corresponding to a specific cycle of bubble nucleation, growth, and subsequent engulfment. (A) _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_ (B)
_Vsf_ = 10 _µm/s_ (C) _Vsf_ = 15 _µm/s_ (D) _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ . The number of peaks extracted is contingent on the solidification
velocity, given that the characteristic nucleation time diminishes as solidification velocity increases. Consequently, 4 peaks were
extracted for 2968s with _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_, 13 peaks for 2430s with _Vsf_ = 10 _µm/s_, 9 peaks for 930s with _Vsf_ = 15 _µm/s_, and 10
peaks for 600s with _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ .


occupied by bubbles, followed by a slower decrease. Notably, the onset of the growth phase for each peak aligns with
the increasing segments of the time evolution of bubble numbers as depicted in figure 4. These ascending sections of
the peaks are attributed to the quasi-simultaneous nucleation of bubbles and their subsequent growth via gas diffusion
from the supersaturated liquid. Conversely, the descending segments correspond to the gradual engulfment of these
bubbles by the advancing solidification front, resulting in a reduction of their apparent area within the liquid. These
curves are significant as they reflect the total area occupied by bubbles in the liquid. Thus, even when bubble growth
is dominant, some bubbles may already start being engulfed by the solidification front. Conversely, when the area
decreases, indicating that most bubbles are being engulfed, some bubbles may continue to grow simultaneously, even
during their engulfment (as is the case for cylindrical bubbles, for example). The peak’s maximum represents the
transition point where the bubble growth rate is surpassed by the rate of their engulfment by the solidification front.
The plateaus depicted in figure 5 denote not only a period of gas segregation at the solidification front but also a phase
during which the majority of the space occupied by the bubbles is engulfed by the advancing solidification front. The
characteristic lag time, _tplateau_ (Figure 4), can thus be interpreted as the cumulative duration of bubble nucleation
and growth _tn_ (ascending part of the peaks), the bubble engulfment period _te_ (descending part of the peaks), and a
subsequent interval of gas segregation without significant nucleation or engulfment activity.
Furthermore, the minor oscillations observed between the main peaks (Figure 5B) are primarily ascribed to the
existence of cylindrical bubbles at the solidification front. In these instances, a portion of the bubble remains emerged
in the liquid, sustained by the supply of dissolved gas. These cylindrical bubbles may achieve a quasi-equilibrium
state with a consistent width, although the diameter of the emerged tip can fluctuate based on pressure, gas diffusion,
and the velocity of solidification. Consequently, in the latter scenario, the area occupied by the emerged tip of the
bubble evolves over time. As illustrated in figure 2B and figure 2C, cylindrical bubbles persist longer at the interface
and display larger diameters at reduced solidification velocities. Under these circumstances, their extended presence
at the interface leads to a greater consumption of gas, as the diffusion rate of gas sufficiently compensates for the
engulfment by the advancing solidification front. This gas diffusion towards cylindrical bubbles may consequently
decelerate the rise in gas concentration at the solidification front. Thus, we assume that the presence of cylindrical
bubbles influences bubble nucleation dynamics, particularly affecting the bubble nucleation rate during solidification.
Nonetheless, the nucleation of a solitary bubble can also occur, contributing to these minor oscillations between the
peaks.
Based on figure 5, we extracted the peaks describing the evolution of the area occupied by the bubbles and
normalized them (figure 6). This methodology enables an accurate comparison of bubble dynamic profiles and
quantifies how variations in solidification velocity influence the overall bubble behavior throughout the solidification
process. Our findings reveal that for all investigated solidification rates, the observed peaks and corresponding
durations of nucleation, growth, and engulfment periods of bubbles remain consistent for a given solidification velocity.
For solidification velocities of _Vsf_ = 15 _µm/s_ and _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_, a notable symmetry emerges, indicating that the
duration of bubble nucleation and growth _tn_ matches that of bubble engulfment _te_ . At lower solidification velocities,
particularly for _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_ and _Vsf_ = 10 _µm/s_, the peaks exhibit asymmetry due to an extended duration of

the bubble engulfment phase as the solidification velocity decreases. The analysis of these peaks facilitates the
determination of the timescales linked with the coupled gas and bubble dynamics, which are influenced by the
solidification front velocity (figure 7).
We observe a reduction in the average duration of gas bubble nucleation and growth from _tn_ = 13 _.s_ at _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_
to _tn_ = 3 _._ 5 _s_ at _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ . Furthermore, a pronounced decline is noted in the duration of bubble engulfment by
the solidification front, decreasing from _te_ = 76 _._ 9 _s_ at _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_ to _te_ = 11 _._ 7 _s_ at _Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ .
This indicates that the duration of bubble nucleation and growth is less influenced by the solidification velocity
compared to the time necessary for their engulfment by the solidification front. At elevated solidification velocities,
bubbles are more swiftly engulfed due to the faster progression of the solid–liquid interface. Furthermore, when
the solidification velocity attains a sufficiently high magnitude, the diffusion of gas from the surrounding liquid
is inadequate to compensate for the effect of the advancing front, thus imposing a limitation on bubble growth.
Conversely, at reduced velocities, bubbles can grow for extended periods as the interface progresses at a slower rate.
As will be elaborated in the subsequent section, the fact that the duration of bubble nucleation and growth is less
affected by the solidification velocity is attributable to the observation that the critical gas concentration required for
nucleation remains relatively constant within our system.
We focused so far on the nucleation rate and characteristic nucleation times as a function of the solidification
velocity. Nevertheless, an additional crucial parameter warranting investigation is the spatial location of bubble
nucleation.


**D.** **Where do bubbles nucleate ?**


We direct our focus toward the location of bubble nucleation during the solidification process. The nucleation
distance was quantified as the distance between the bubble and the solidification front in the first frame where the
bubble appeared visible. We postulate that bubble movement immediately following nucleation and between frames
is negligible. This assumption is corroborated by our experimental findings, as no movement of bubbles was observed
between nucleation and their interaction with the solidification front or adjacent bubbles.
The distance between the solidification front and either the center or edge of the bubble was quantified in relation to
the solidification rate _Vsf_ (figure 8). Our findings reveal that approximately 73% of the bubbles nucleated during the
experiments emerged on the solidification front. This observation suggests a predominantly heterogeneous nucleation
mechanism, facilitated by the presence of a substrate (the ice crystals) and the locally elevated gas concentration
close to the solidification front due to gas segregation. Nevertheless, it indicates that 27% of the bubbles nucleate
within the liquid phase, predominantly within the region extending up to 100 _µm_ from the solidification front, where

different solidification velocities _Vsf_ . These distances are estimated from the initial appearance of the bubble, with the assumption that the displacement of the bubble from its nucleation point to its first observable position is negligible. Measurements
were conducted for four different applied solidification velocities, and lateral dispersion was integrated into the data points to
improve visual clarity. (B) Proportion of bubbles that nucleate at the solidification front and within the liquid bulk in relation

gas segregation initiates. The solidification velocity does not affect this proportion, as the percentage of bubbles
nucleating on the solidification front consistently remains between 60% and 80% across all tested velocities, without
any discernible trend.
We estimate that the predominant proportion of the 27% of bubbles that do not nucleate on the solidification
front emerges via homogeneous nucleation, attributable to the lack of particles or alternative substrates within the
liquid. Conversely, it is plausible that some of these bubbles may have undergone heterogeneous nucleation due to
the presence of impurities within the liquid. By considering exclusively those bubbles that nucleated within the bulk
liquid, we measured average nucleation distances _dsf_ of 27 _±_ 25 _µm_ from the bubble edge nearest to the solidification
front. No discernible impact of solidification velocity on the measured nucleation distance was identified, consistent
with observations made across the entire set of nucleated bubbles. The nucleation distance measurements for bubbles
that do not nucleate on the solidification front, across varying solidification velocities, are detailed in Table I.
It is frequently asserted in solidification studies that all gas bubbles nucleate heterogeneously either on the solidification front [38, 46] or on particles present within the liquid [34, 47]. Moreover, theoretical analyses propose that
nucleation is considerably more probable at the solidification front due to its favorable energetic conditions [37, 48].
However, some empirical observations suggest that while the predominant majority of bubbles nucleate heterogeneously on the front, a minor portion may nucleate in proximity to it without the front serving as a substrate [33].
Such nucleation events are typically interpreted as heterogeneous nucleation occurring on minor impurities [39]. Our
empirical findings indicate that under the specified experimental conditions, approximately 30% of the bubbles neither nucleate on the solidification front nor on discernible particles or impurities. Although it remains possible that
certain bubbles nucleated heterogeneously on the glass slides confining the samples, or on undetectable impurities, we
postulate that a significant proportion might have nucleated homogeneously.


**E.** **Critical gas concentration for nucleation**


The critical bubble nucleation concentration _Cn_ _[∗]_ [within our system can be derived from experimental observations,]
using the bubble nucleation distance and the characteristic nucleation time under varying solidification conditions.
Assuming that each nucleation event resets the local conditions and initiates a novel phase of gas segregation at the
solidification front, Pohl’s equation (Eq. 1) is used to estimate the gas concentration at the specific time and location
of nucleation. The interval required to achieve the critical gas concentration facilitating further nucleation corresponds
to the lag time _tplateau_ depicted in figure 4 and figure 5. To accurately assess the critical concentration for bubble
nucleation, it is crucial to ascertain the nucleation site of the bubbles to incorporate the corresponding distance
from the solidification front, denoted as x, into equation 1. Nevertheless, in predicting a homogeneous nucleation

Table I. Experimentally measured characteristic data on bubble nucleation dynamics in our system. This table provides the
values of the characteristic nucleation time between successive bubble nucleation bursts _tplateau_, the nucleation time, and the
nucleation distance of bubbles from the solidification front, with measurements taken at the middle and bottom of the nucleated
bubbles. The critical concentrations for bubble nucleation _Cn_ _[∗]_ [are estimated using equation 1, using the experimentally obtained]
values presented in this table.


threshold, only those bubbles that nucleate at a distance from the solidification front are considered, predicated on
the presumption that bubble generation in the liquid bulk primarily results from homogeneous nucleation.
Table I provides a summary of the values of the characteristic nucleation time and the homogeneous nucleation
distance of bubbles within the liquid across solidification velocities ranging from 5 to 20 _µm/s_ . Several estimations
of the characteristic bubble nucleation time were conducted. When exclusively considering the plateaus presented in
figure 5, the continuous segregation of gas during the nucleation process is disregarded. Nevertheless, as long as the
solidification velocity remains constant, the segregation of gas consistently should adhere to equation 1. Consequently,
we measured the bubble nucleation times occurring between plateaus to obtain a range of estimations of the critical
nucleation concentrations. We observe that the nucleation distance between the bubbles and the solidification interface seems to be independent of the solidification velocity, in contrast to the characteristic nucleation time between
successive bubble nucleation bursts _tplateau_ .
Equation 1 facilitates the reconstruction of gas segregation profiles in accordance with the experimental conditions,
and enables the estimation of the critical concentration necessary for bubble nucleation within our system (Figure 9).
Consequently, among the range of solidification velocities explored, the principal characteristics distinguishing the
critical nucleation concentration are the gas segregation profile and the characteristic lag time tplateau. Our findings indicate that the critical nucleation concentration for bubble formation _C_ _[∗]_ remains consistent across the three
solidification velocities examined, demonstrating nearly identical _C_ _[∗]_ values for _Vsf_ = 10 _µm/s_, _Vsf_ = 15 _µm/s_, and
_Vsf_ = 20 _µm/s_ .
The estimated critical nucleation concentration for _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_ deviates slightly from those obtained at alternative
solidification velocities, with a value approaching 4 _._ 5 _g/L_ . Given that the nucleation distance seems to remain largely
unaffected by changes in solidification velocity, this variance might originate from the distinctive lag time _tplateau_
observed at this particular velocity. Importantly, _Vsf_ = 5 _µm/s_ denotes the scenario where nucleation events were the
least frequent, and bubble growth at the interface was notably pronounced, thereby resulting in limited statistical
data. Hence, the critical nucleation concentration estimated under these circumstances may be less reliable than at
other velocities. Nevertheless, the estimated value retains the same order of magnitude as those derived from other
solidification velocities, which we consider satisfactory given the extensive range of critical nucleation concentrations
reported in the literature.
Therefore, for the other three velocities examined, it is inferred that the rate of solidification has an insignificant
impact on the critical concentration required for bubble nucleation. Analysis of the entire set of experimental data
leads to the estimation of an average value _C_ _[∗]_ = 8 _._ 4 _±_ 3 _._ 1 _g/L_, which exceeds the carbon dioxide solubility limit in
water at 25 _[◦]_ C by approximately 5 to 6 times, and approaches 3 times the solubility limit at 0 _[◦]_ C.
Under our experimental conditions, a portion of the bubble population nucleates heterogeneously at the solidification
front. Following nucleation, the majority of these bubbles expand prior to being eventually engulfed by the front.
As a result, a significant fraction of the gas that segregates at the solidification front is consumed through both
the heterogeneous nucleation of bubbles and their subsequent growth, regardless of the nucleation pathway involved.
These findings indicate that the effective gas concentration at the interface preceding bubble nucleation may decrease
below the level predicted by equation 1, suggesting that the true critical bubble nucleation concentration _Cn_ _[∗]_ [under]
our experimental conditions might be lower than currently estimated.
It is well established that homogeneous nucleation is thermodynamically less favorable compared to heterogeneous
nucleation, often necessitating gas supersaturation’s that exceed 100 times the solubility limit in certain systems [29].
The measurement of the critical nucleation concentration in directional solidification presents notable challenges.
Various estimates suggest it ranges from 7 [30] to 20 [31], 40 [40] or 100 times [29] the solubility limit, depending on
the solidification conditions. Our findings, therefore, fall within the lower spectrum of the estimated critical nucleation
concentrations for directional solidification. Two primary hypotheses may account for this relatively low estimation.
The first implicates the confinement of our samples between two glass slides, which may also function as preferential

dioxide dissolved in water at an initial concentration _C_ 0 = 1 _._ 4 _g/L_ . The critical concentration estimates were obtained using
the average nucleation distances and the characteristic nucleation times for the red data points, in addition to the sum of the

nucleation sites. In observing the largest bubbles at the moment of nucleation, the two-dimensional observational
approach precludes the determination of whether one of the slides served as a substrate for heterogeneous nucleation.
Furthermore, the phenomenon of bubble nucleation predominantly occurring in bursts suggests that the initial bubble
in a sequence may perturb the surrounding liquid, thereby inducing either a localized supersaturation or mechanical
perturbations conducive to subsequent nearby nucleation. Although this second hypothesis remains plausible, we
were unable to confirm it experimentally.


**IV.** **CONCLUSIONS**


In summary, cryo-confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to conduct an _in situ_ investigation of the coupled
dynamics of gas segregation and bubble nucleation, growth and engulfment during directional solidification under
rigorously controlled conditions, focusing particularly on solidification velocities and temperature gradients. We
demonstrated that the dynamics of bubble nucleation are governed by a characteristic nucleation time, which is
determined by the solidification velocity. This characteristic time emerges from the interaction of several mechanisms
occurring during solidification, including gas segregation at the solidification front, bubble nucleation and growth, and
their subsequent engulfment by the front. The parameters of solidification further influence the equilibrium between
gas segregation and the engulfment rate, which in turn affects the interaction of bubbles with the solidification front,
thereby impacting the overall bubble nucleation dynamics.
In addition to the predominance of heterogeneous nucleation at the solidification front, we found that homogeneous
nucleation within the liquid phase occurs frequently. The measured nucleation distances for these bubbles do not
exhibit a significant dependence on the solidification velocity. These experimental observations enabled us to propose
an estimation for the critical nucleation concentration within our system— a critical value that appears to be unaffected
by the solidification velocity. These findings enhance our comprehension of the fundamental processes governing
bubble nucleation dynamics during solidification, thus contributing to the improved control over porosity formation
in solidified materials.
