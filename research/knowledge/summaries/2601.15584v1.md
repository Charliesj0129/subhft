Abstract—Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) requires the development of a waveform capable of efficiently
supporting both communication and sensing functionalities. This
paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of
both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and
the Chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and
sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new
architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the
receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We
demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals
results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which
effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a
key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM
framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires
the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn
reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed
affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform
without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving
communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of
integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the
slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation.
The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp
has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square
error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we
characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing
performance.

I. INTRODUCTION


Traditionally, communications and radar systems have been
designed and operated independently, often using separate
spectral resources [1]. Modern communication systems face
increasing thirst for spectrum and hardware efficiency, particularly in the context of next-generation technologies [2].
These challenges underscore the benefits of Integrated Sensing
and Communication (ISAC) systems, which integrate sensing
and communication functionalities into a shared infrastructure

[3]. By leveraging the same waveforms and spectrum, ISAC

addresses critical issues such as spectrum scarcity [4], energy
consumption [5], while mitigating the cost and complexity of
maintaining separate systems [6].
ISAC systems find applications in diverse fields. For example, in autonomous vehicles, ISAC supports radar-based
sensing for obstacle detection along with inter-vehicle communication [7]. The International Telecommunication Union
Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) has established highlevel guidelines for ISAC as part of its IMT-2030 (6G) framework [2], emphasizing the convergence of communications
and sensing functionalities to address emerging needs such
as autonomous mobility, environmental monitoring, and smart
infrastructure [8]. This integration is driven by the potential
benefits of ISAC, including efficient spectrum utilization,
reduced hardware redundancy, and enhanced capabilities for
precise localization and environmental awareness [9]. Building
on ITU-R’s vision, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) has undertaken a Feasibility Study on ISAC under
Release 19, detailed in Technical Report 22.837 [10], to explore practical implementation strategies. These include spectrum allocation, waveform design, and resource management
techniques, ensuring ISAC’s seamless integration into future
cellular networks [11], [12].
The waveform design is a critical aspect of ISAC systems,
since it simultaneously serves as the foundation for achieving
efficient communication and accurate sensing [13]. ISAC
systems must enable high-speed and reliable data transmission, while performing tasks such as range, velocity, and
angle estimation. The choice of waveform directly determines
the system’s ability to meet these dual objectives [14]. A
well-designed waveform strikes a trade-off between sensing
accuracy and communication performance. In the waveform
design of ISAC systems, key properties such as autocorrelation
sidelobes [15], correlation peaks [16], and the ambiguity
function [17] play a pivotal role in determining sensing performance. A well-designed waveform should exhibit a sharp main
peak in its autocorrelation function with minimal sidelobes to
ensure accurate range and velocity estimation while avoiding
ambiguity [18]. Having a high peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR)
is essential for distinguishing closely spaced targets, while
properties like range resolution and Doppler tolerance depend
on the waveform’s bandwidth and robustness to frequency
shifts [19].
ISAC waveforms, which underpin ISAC technology, have
been the subject of comprehensive research. Wei et al. [20]
presented a comprehensive survey and explored a suite of
innovations in signal design, processing, and optimization,
while addressing challenges and potential applications. The
ISAC waveforms are classified primarily into three categories


depending on the design methods, such as communicationcentric waveforms (CCW) [19], [21], [22], sensor-centric
waveforms (SCW) [23]–[25], and joint waveform optimization and design (JWOD) [26]–[28]. Communication-centric
waveforms, such as OFDM [19], single-carrier waveforms,
and spread spectrum techniques [21], relying on PSK/QAM
modulated signals, are designed primarily for efficient data
transmission, offering high spectral efficiency, robustness to
channel impairments, and low bit error rates (BER) [22].
Although these waveforms excel in communication tasks, they
face significant limitations when harnessed for sensing. For
instance, they often exhibit poor autocorrelation properties,
leading to high sidelobes that reduce the accuracy of range and
velocity estimation, while introducing ambiguities in target
detection [29].
The CCW rely on traditional communication waveforms to
extract the sensing information of interest from the echoes
of signals reflected by nearby objects. In 2011, Sturm et
al. [19] developed a framework that employs OFDM and
incorporates advanced sensing signal processing algorithms,
with an emphasis on optimizing the overall performance. The
accuracy of the estimation depends on the number of symbols
allocated for sensing, thereby reducing the number of symbols
available for communication. The orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS) waveform [30]–[32], formulated within the
delay-Doppler framework is particularly effective in tackling
the Doppler effects. The characteristics of OTFS make it
eminently suitable for systems that require the integration of
communication and sensing capabilities [32].
Furthermore, Sanson et al. [33] developed a signal based
on generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) for
ISAC, emphasizing its advantages in terms of reduced interuser interference and guard band requirements in comparison
to OFDM. This approach exhibits notable improvements in
range resolution and demonstrates resilience in interferencelimited environments. On the other hand, Koslowski et al.

[34] explored the adaptation of joint OFDM-based radar and
communication systems to Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC)
signals. They demonstrated that radar imaging methodologies,
specifically the two-dimensional periodogram employed for
range-Doppler estimation in OFDM radar, can be adapted
for FBMC radar systems. Additionally, Sangeeta et al. [35]
investigated the use of orthogonal chirp division multiplexing
(OCDM) as a waveform, showing that it provides robust communication performance in time-frequency selective channels
and achieves both accurate bistatic range as well as Doppler
velocity estimation, validating its suitability for automotive
ISAC applications. Most communication waveforms can be
utilized for sensing applications, provided that the transmit
waveform is known to the receiver a priori [36]. Hence, the
major condition for using the CCW is to use pilot signals and
it is suitable for monostatic scenarios.
By contrast, sensing-centric waveforms are designed for accurate parameter estimation, such as range, velocity, and angle,
making them ideal for radar and other sensing applications.
Linear frequency modulated (LFM) and chirp waveforms are
the most common sensing-centric ones used for conveying
communication symbols in ISAC systems [23]–[25], [29].

Both LFM and chirp waveforms offer robust sensing capabilities, but their data rates for communication are constrained.
Therefore, the aforementioned methods typically demonstrate
improved radar sensing capabilities, albeit at a reduced communication rate. Although information-bearing symbols can
be readily inserted into any radar waveform through frequency
shifts [15], [29] or phase modulation [24], [29], this inevitably
incurs some degradation in sensing performance, while the
hardware architecture of the transceiver will become more
complex to the transmission and reception of information data

[16].
To improve the sensing performance of OFDM systems,
many chirp-based OFDM systems were proposed [15], [16],

[29]. Li et al. [29] proposed the embedding of phasemodulated communication information into the OFDM chirp
waveform for delay-Doppler radar. The method proposed in

[29] incorporates the chirp at the transmitter (Tx) in the analog
domain, which can lead to synchronization problems and
also reduce the flexibility in incorporating chirp into OFDM
signals. In [15], an innovative approach was proposed where
the LFM signal is transformed into the frequency domain
using FFT. This transformation effectively mitigates the delayDoppler coupling, simplifying the signal processing requirements. Furthermore, Zhao et al. [16] proposed a novel OFDM
chirp waveform based design for improving the correlation
properties for both radar and communication applications.
However, the method faces high computational complexity
and requires careful tuning of Pareto weights to balance the
conflicting design objectives, which can be challenging in
some applications.
Joint waveform design is mainly based on optimizing the
desired waveform based on different applications. It hinges
on balancing the sensing versus communication performance.
There are numerous performance metrics, such as the signalto-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) [26], mutual interference (MI) [27], Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) [28], of which
the waveform can be optimized. In [26], the authors conceived a spectrum-sharing strategy for colocated MIMO radar
and communication that maximizes the radar’s SINR, while
meeting specific communication rate and power requirements.
Additionally, the authors of [27] optimize the MI between the
response matrix of a target and the reflected signals, while
satisfying the data rate requirements of the communications
users. Constrained by the SINR requirement of each user and
the total transmit power allocation, Liu et al. [28] minimized
the CRB of the beamforming matrix.
The deployment of ISAC in future wireless networks can be
achieved cost-effectively by modifying the structure of existing
standardized communication frames for sensing applications

[38], [39], while using bespoke physical layer reference signals
for sensing purpose, such as demodulation reference signals
(DMRS), phase tracking reference signals (PTRS), channel
state information reference signals (CSI-RS), and positioning
reference signals (PRS). Wei et al. [38] utilized PRS for
estimating both the range and velocity. However, the performance of PRS is highly dependent on the fraction of resources
allocated. For instance, allocating resources having a comb
size of 2 would use 50% of the total subcarriers, which would

halve the communications capacity.
Against this backdrop, we propose a new waveform that
is capable of simultaneously transmitting communication data
along with performing sensing tasks without the need for pilot
subcarriers. The contributions of this paper are boldly and
explicitly contrasted to the literature in Table I and can be
summarized as follows:


 - We propose an innovative waveform design that employs
the affine addition of chirp and OFDM (AAC-OFDM)
signals in the time domain (TD). We design a systematic
technique of optimizing the affine addition parameters,
carefully balancing the trade-off between robust communication performance and precise sensing capabilities.

 - We derive the ambiguity function for the AAC-OFDM
waveform, which establishes a theoretical framework for
evaluating its sensing and communication performance.
This derivation serves not only as a foundational tool for
optimizing the AAC-OFDM waveform but also underscores its applicability across a range of ISAC scenarios.
By formalizing this relationship, the study paves the
way for the systematic performance enhancement of the
proposed system.

  - The simulation-based sensing performance results have
shown that AAC-OFDM does not require pilot subcarriers
or prior knowledge of the transmitted data for performing
sensing tasks, which makes it an eminently suitable candidate for enhancing the spectral efficiency and sensing performance of ISAC systems. This property of AAC-OFDM
is beneficial in the case of bistatic/multistatic sensing,
where the receiver is located at a different base station
and does not have prior knowledge of the transmitted
bits. This approach provides a practical framework for
advancing waveform design, demonstrating its potential
to meet the growing demands of ISAC applications.

  - We present a comparative analysis to evaluate the performance of the chirp multiplied OFDM (CM-OFDM)
waveform conceived against OFDM used as a position
reference signal (PRS) commonly employed in OFDMaided ISAC systems. Through the ambiguity function, we
have shown that the CM-OFDM waveform significantly
outperforms OFDM in terms of its range resolution, while
maintaining comparable communications performance.
This shows that the performance of PRS is improved by
CM-OFDM.

 - We present a novel comparison of the performance of
AAC-OFDM and CM-OFDM signals implemented at
both the 5G New Radio (NR) slot and symbol levels. The



analysis focuses on the root mean square error (RMSE) of
range and velocity estimation under each implementation
strategy. The results reveal that the slot-level superposition of chirp signals consistently outperforms its symbollevel implementation, offering superior sensing accuracy
and robustness. This finding highlights the advantage of
slot-level integration in enhancing system performance,
providing valuable insights for optimizing the waveform
design of ISAC systems.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we discuss the system model along with the channel model
used in this paper. In Section III, we formulate the waveforms
of AAC-OFDM and CM-OFDM, followed by analysis of both
waveforms in Section IV. In Section V, we proposed the
implementation technique to improve the sensing performance,
followed by their simulation-based characterization for communication and sensing tasks in Section VI. Our conclusions
are provided in Section VII.

II. SYSTEM MODEL


The system model shown in Fig. 1 represents both monostatic and bistatic sensing. Monostatic sensing is established
from a distributed monostatic system by arranging the virtual
co-location of the transmitter and receiver upon connecting
them via fiber. Both the transmitter and receiver perfectly know
the transmitted signals using this setup. By contrast, bistatic
sensing has the transmitter and receiver at separate locations.
As a result, the receiver may only have partial knowledge of
the transmitted signals [40].
Consider a single-input and single-output (SISO) system,
where the distance between the base station (BS) and the
objects is R. The BS 1 in Fig. 1 transmits a signal that is


reflected by the objects, and then the receiver at BS 1 or
BS 2, depending on the type of sensing processes, extracts
the necessary information about the object’s location. The

block diagram provided in Fig. 2 illustrates the system architecture intended for ISAC applications. In the transmission
chain, binary data are initially processed through an OFDM
block, then the chirp signal is incorporated in the resultant
OFDM signal for supporting the ISAC functionality. The
processed signal is then transformed into an analog format
using a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter and delivered across
the channel as x(t). Upon reception, the received signal y(t)
is subjected to analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion to enable
digital processing. The sensing signal processor in Fig. 2
analyzes the received signal for extracting the sensing-related
information, including range and velocity estimation.
In much of the literature, the sensing and communication
signals are typically processed jointly at the receiver. By
contrast, the proposed system extracts the sensing information separately and uses it for enhancing communication
performance. By embedding the sensing signal within the
communication framework, the receiver leverages the sensing information extracted for optimizing communication. The
dechirping operation in Fig. 2 is utilized for eliminating the
chirp component. The signal subsequently traverses the OFDM
block, where it undergoes demodulation using FFT for retrieving the transmitted data. Ultimately, the data demodulation
block in Fig. 2 extracts the original binary information.
Two distinct systems have been conceived in this work.
One is formulated by the affine addition of chirp to OFDM
termed as AAC-OFDM, while the other is formulated by the
multiplicative amalgam of chirp with OFDM, referred to as
CM-OFDM. The delay-Doppler channel impulse response is
modeled as a sum of multiple propagation paths [41]:

combined using an affine addition method. This design aims
to decouple the sensing and communication functionalities, allowing a flexible ISAC waveform design. By contrast, in CMOFDM the chirp’s linear frequency modulation is exploited
for sensing, while the underlying OFDM structure facilitates
communication.

A. AAC-OFDM


The discrete-time domain representation of the AAC-OFDM
signal a(l) is defined as


a(l) = (1 − α)s(l) + (α)c(l), (2)


where α is the power allocation factor, while s(l) and c(l) are
the OFDM signal and chirp signal, respectively, defined as

The time index l represents discrete sampling points within
each symbol, ranging from l = mN to l = (m + 1)N − 1,
facilitating the time-domain description of the signal. Furthermore, sm(l) represents samples of the mth OFDM symbol
after the N -point IFFT operation applied to N number of
sub-carriers, which can be represented as:

sm(l) =

The modulated data symbol Xm(n) conveys the actual information payload for the nth subcarrier during the mth symbol
duration. Additionally, cm(l) represents the chirp which is
applied to the mth symbol. The chirp signal parameters
are perfectly aligned with the OFDM parameters, ensuring
the incorporation of chirp results in a seamlessly integrated
system. This design ensures that changes in the key OFDM
parameters, such as the subcarrier spacing or the number of
subcarriers, automatically adjust the chirp’s time duration and
all other associated parameters, maintaining coherence and
compatibility between the two waveforms. The chirp signal
cm(l) is defined in the discrete time domain as



h(τ, f ) =



P� −1

hi δ(τ − τi) δ(f − fd,i), (1)

where P is the total number of propagation paths and each
path i has its own complex gain hi, delay τi, and Doppler
shift fd,i. Finally, δ(·) denotes the Dirac delta function.


III. PROPOSED WAVEFORM BASED ON OFDM WITH PULSE


COMPRESSION RADAR SYSTEMS


In this section, the waveforms of AAC-OFDM and CMOFDM will be discussed, highlighting their characteristics
and applications. The AAC-OFDM waveform is our novel
proposed approach where the OFDM and chirp signals are



where qm(n) represents the amplitude of the chirp corresponding to the nth subcarrier and mth symbol, capturing the signal’s strength for each subcarrier and symbol. The parameter
βm,n denotes the chirp rate associated with the nth subcarrier
and mth symbol, determining the frequency modulation of
the chirp. The sampling interval Ts = N ∆1 f [is the reciprocal]
of the product of the total number of subcarriers N and the
subcarrier spacing ∆f, ensuring appropriate sampling of the

signal in the time domain. The chirp rate for the chirp signal
is defined according to the OFDM symbol and can be denoted
as follows:

βm,nj,i = [(][n][j][ −] [n][i][)∆][f], (7)

Tc

where nj and ni represent the indices of the OFDM subcarriers, while for the chirp signal, it represents the start and end
frequency of the chirp. The (nj − ni)∆f in (7) sweeps the
total bandwidth Bc of the chirp. Furthermore, Tc is the chirp
duration, which is adjusted according to the OFDM symbol
duration To. If the chirp is imposed on a single OFDM symbol,
then Tc = To. We have (7) highlighting how the chirp’s
rate depends on the difference between the subcarrier indices,
scaled by the duration of the OFDM symbol.
This demonstrates that the chirp spans a frequency range
proportional to the subcarrier spacing, normalized by the
OFDM symbol duration. The frequency ramp created by
the chirp naturally aligns with the frequency domain (FD)
structure of the OFDM subcarriers, allowing the chirp to be
integrated into the system. This integration enables the chirp
to encode the subcarrier frequency differences, while enhancing the signal’s utility for both sensing and communication
applications.
In our analysis, we redefine βm,nj,i as βm,n, which implies
that for each fixed index n, the indices are set for ensuring
that ni = n and nj = n + 1. We substitute the expressions for
sm(l) and cm(l) from (5) and (6) into (3) and (4), respectively.
Then we can substitute (3) and (4) into (2), where the AACOFDM signal a(l) is represented as

The received AAC-OFDM signal is influenced by several
critical factors. The amplitude scaling factor ξi accounts for the
effects of target reflectivity, attenuation, and complex channel
gain hi of the path, while n(t) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The term [2][R] c [i] represents the round trip

propagation delay, where Ri is the distance covered by the ith
path after being reflected from the object and c is the speed of
light, ensuring that the timing of the signal accurately reflects
the range to the object. The Doppler shift fd,i arises from the
relative motion between the transmitter and the object, causing
a frequency shift in the signal. The velocity of the object is
known from the Doppler frequency as vi = fd,ic/2fc, where
fc is the carrier frequency of the signal. Additionally, the�

Furthermore, To=T +TCP is the duration of the total symbol,

The main advantage of the AAC-OFDM signal is that at
the receiver, the knowledge of chirp rate is sufficient for
estimating the range and velocity of the target object, which
is an advantage in the bistatic scenario. The AAC-OFDM



The CM-OFDM receiver needs prior information of the transmitted data along with the chirp rate for estimating the range
and velocity of the target object. Upon transmitting a signal
from BS 1 and receiving it at the receiver of BS 1 as shown
in Fig. 1, the CM-OFDM signal reflected from the target is
described by y(t) as:

The sensing depends on the parameters of the chirp sequence introduced into the OFDM signal, and its specific
parameters directly predetermine the key metrics such as
the achievable range resolution ∆R, maximum unambiguous
range Rmax, and the maximum unambiguous velocity vmax
formulated as [42]

∆R =, Rmax = [cf][s][T][c], |vmax| <, (14)

where Bc is the bandwidth of the chirp, and λ = fcc [is the]
wavelength of the signal. From (14) we can conclude that
improving the range resolution requires increasing the chirp
bandwidth, but this also limits the maximum unambiguous
range. However, extending the duration Tc of the chirp, can
increase the maximum range. On the other hand, a longer
Tc reduces the maximum unambiguous velocity. To solve this
design dilemma, we introduce an innovative implementation
technique compatible with the 5G New Radio (NR) frame
structure [43], which will improve all the metrics and enhance
the sensing performance.


IV. ANALYSIS OF AAC-OFDM AND CM-OFDM


A. Ambiguity Function


The ambiguity function is an important tool for sensing
waveform design and analysis, since it characterizes the features of a waveform and its corresponding matched filter. By
analyzing the ambiguity function of the transmitted waveform,
one can determine the sensing system’s resolution capability,
measurement accuracy, and ambiguity when optimal matched
filtering is employed. The ambiguity function is defined [17]
as :

The product of the rectangular windows restricts t to the

          -          tmax = min m To + To, τ + m [′] To + To . (24)


The effective integration range is t ∈ [tmin, tmax]. Let us define



Td = [t][max][ −] [t][min]

The rectangular windows [mTo, mTo + To] and [τ +

Accordingly, in all sums over m, m [′] we evaluate



where x(t) represents the transmitted signal, τ is the time
delay and fd is the Doppler frequency shift.



B. Ambiguity Function of AAC-OFDM
The ambiguity function χ(τ, fd) of AAC-OFDM is defined
as



Td = [T][o][ −|][τ][ + (][m][′][ −] [m][)][T][o][|]

χ(τ, fd) =

These expressions hold when the relative shift satisfies
|τ + (m [′] - m)To| ≤ To, otherwise there is no overlap, and
the corresponding integral equals zero. When we consider a
single OFDM symbol, we set m [′] = m and adopt a symbolcentered time origin. For |τ | ≤ To this gives



where a(t) is the transmitted signal of AAC-OFDM defined in
(9). Expanding a(t)a [∗] (t − τ ) and assuming that equal power
is allocated to both the OFDM and to the chirp waveform will
results into four terms:


χ(τ, fd) = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4, (17)



Furthermore, I2 in (17) is the cross-ambiguity between the
OFDM and chirp signal, which is represented by

and using the variable substitution of u = β [x] [, the integral in]

(32) can be expressed in terms of Fresnel integrals as follows:

This function is defined for two cases depending on the value
of τ defined in (28) and (29). The transmitted AAC-OFDM
waveform is a(t) = (1 − α)s(t)+ αc(t). Substituting this into
the ambiguity function yields� χ(�τ, fd) = (1 − α) [2] I4(τ, fd) +
α(1 − α) I2(τ, fd) + I3(τ, fd) + α [2] I1(τ, fd), so that α
only changes the relative weights of I1, I2, I3 and I4 without
altering their qualitative shapes. Allowing general chirp rates
βm,n across symbols and subcarriers affects only the internal
phase and the delay–Doppler coupling inside these terms,
while the four-term structure and overlap windows remain
unchanged.

D. PAPR of AAC–OFDM


This section quantifies how the AAC-OFDM weight α
influences the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the
transmitted symbol. We derive a bound that yields a simple
threshold on α, ensuring that the PAPR of AAC-OFDM is
strictly lower than that of OFDM under equal-power normalization. For any length-N block x(l), we define the PAPR as

From (3) s(l) denotes the OFDM time block and from (4)

normalized to unit average power:1 �N −1 N1 �Nl=0−1 [|][s][(][l][)][|][2][ = 1][ and]
N l=0 [|][c][(][l][)][|][2][ = 1][. Let us define the OFDM peak as]
g ≜ max0≤l<N −1|s(l)|. Then PAPR(s) = g [2] . and for a
unit-modulus chirp (|c(l)| = 1) we have PAPR(c) = 1.
The AAC-OFDM from (2) a(l) = (1 − α)s(l) + αc(l), with
α ∈ [0, 1], The per-symbol correlation and its magnitude are

a(l) can be written as


G(α) = (1 − α) [2] + α [2] + 2α(1 − α) ℜ{ρ}. (45)


For a fair PAPR comparison at equal power, we use


a(l)
uα(l) ≜   - . (46)

G(α)


Hence, u0(l) = s(l) with PAPR(u0) = g [2], and u1(l) = c(l)
with PAPR(u1) = 1. We first upper-bound the instantaneous
peak via the triangle inequality and lower-bound the average
power using the block correlation. Combining these bounds
yields an explicit bound on PAPR(uα) and a corresponding
design threshold on α. Since both maxl |a(l)| and G(α)
vary continuously with α, the mapping α �→ PAPR(uα) is
continuous within [0, 1] and moves from g [2] at α = 0 to 1 at
α = 1. Thus some α [⋆] ∈ (0, 1] satisfies PAPR(uα [⋆] ) < g [2],
and PAPR(uα) → 1 as α → 1.
Deterministic upper bound and threshold: From the
triangle inequality, we have maxl |a(l)| ≤ (1 − α)g + α.
Using ℜ{ρ} ≥−|ρ| = −e we obtain the lower bound
G(α) ≥ (1 − α) [2] + α [2] - 2α(1 − α)e. Combining with (44)
gives



Using r(t) from (10) and the chirp template c(t) from (23),
the AAC-OFDM matched-filter output over the observation
window is

ΥAAC(τ ) =

This evaluation requires only the chirp rate β and no data

Using y(t) from (13) and the CM-OFDM waveform k(t)
from (12), the CM-OFDM matched-filter output is




     - ∞
ΥCM(τ ) =

y(t) k [∗][�] t − τ W (t) dt, (50)

which requires the knowledge of β and the data sequence
Xm(n) through k(t). In practice [45], (49) and (50) are evaluated via FFT-based circular correlation per OFDM symbol:
one N -point FFT of the received block, a pointwise multiply
with the precomputed spectrum of the template, and one N point IFFT, while for AAC-OFDM the template spectrum is
fixed within a CPI, whereas for CM-OFDM it is regenerated
each symbol.


F. Computational Complexity Analysis


We compare the receiver-side complexity of the proposed
AAC–OFDM and CM–OFDM sensing pipelines against conventional OFDM sensing based on correlation with a fixed
reference such as PRS. Throughout, we adopt the standard
radix-2 FFT cost model, where an N -point FFT or IFFT
requires (N/2) log2 N complex multiplications.
For AAC–OFDM sensing, each symbol in a coherent processing interval (CPI) is processed using FFT-based circular
correlation. The received block undergoes an N -point FFT,
and then it is multiplied pointwise with the precomputed
spectrum of the chirp template, followed by an N -point IFFT.
This results in N log2 N + N complex multiplications per
symbol. Since the chirp is data-independent, its spectrum is
computed once per CPI at a cost of (N/2) log2 N . The overall
sensing complexity of AAC–OFDM over M symbols is

Csense [AAC-OFDM] = M (N log2 N + N ) + [N] 2 [log][2][ N.] (51)

For CM–OFDM sensing, the matched filter template depends on the transmitted data and must be regenerated for
each symbol. Every symbol therefore requires two N -point
FFTs, one pointwise multiplication, and one N -point IFFT,
which amounts to 1.5N log2 N + N complex multiplications
per symbol. The resulting complexity over the CPI is


Csense [CM-OFDM] = M (1.5N log2 N + N ) . (52)


When CM-OFDM is used to enhance PRS as shown in Fig. 4,
the reference is the fixed PRS multiplied by the fixed chirp, so
its spectrum can be computed once and reused within a CPI.
Consequently, the sensing complexity equals that of AACOFDM.
For conventional OFDM sensing using a fixed pilot or
PRS, the reference template is constant across symbols and its
spectrum can be computed once per CPI. Each symbol then
requires one FFT, one IFFT, and a pointwise multiplication,



PAPR(uα) ≤




   - �2
(1 − α)g + α

(47)
(1 − α) [2] + α [2] - 2α(1 − α) e [.]



A sufficient condition for PAPR(uα) < g [2] is that the righthand side of (47) is lower than g [2] ; enforcing this inequality
gives the threshold


2g (ge + 1)
αth(g, e) = (48)
g [2] + 2g − 1 + 2g [2] e [,]

and therefore any α > αth(g, e) ensures PAPR(uα) < g [2] .
As a design implication, using (47), any choice α > αth(g, e)
in (2) guarantees PAPR(uα) < PAPR(s) = g [2] under equalpower normalization; in the decorrelated regime (e ≈ 0), the

2g
threshold reduces to αth(g, 0) =
g [2] + 2g − 1 [.]


E. Design of Sensing receiver for AAC-OFDM and CMOFDM


At the receiver side, the range estimation is performed
with a matched filter over a finite observation window. The
CPI begins at t0 and has a duration of Tobs. In symbol-wise
processing Tobs = To, and in slot-wise processing with� M�
symbols Tobs = MTo. The window W (t) = rect tT−obst0

restricts processing to [t0, t0 + Tobs). The physical round-trip
delay τ0 = 2R/c is embedded in the received waveforms, and
the matched filter sweeps a lag variable τ to locate the peak.

which is identical to AAC–OFDM. The sensing complexity is
therefore

Csense [OFDM] = M (N log2 N + N ) + [N] 2 [log][2][ N.] (53)

On the communications path, all three schemes require one
FFT per symbol for OFDM demodulation followed by persubcarrier equalization. AAC–OFDM and CM–OFDM add
only a dechirp operation in the time domain, which amounts
to N complex multiplications per symbol and it is negligible
compared with the FFT cost.
Finally, Doppler estimation implemented through phase
unwrapping across the M slow-time samples, differencing, and
averaging involves O(M ) lightweight scalar operations, which
is negligible compared to the O(MN log N ) FFT workload
that dominates the receiver complexity. AAC–OFDM achieves
the same asymptotic complexity as conventional OFDM sensing while operating without pilots, and it is more efficient than
CM–OFDM by eliminating the per-symbol template FFT.


V. PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION TECHNIQUE TO IMPROVE
SENSING


In this section, we propose a technique for improving the
range and velocity estimation by developing a novel implementation technique based on the 5G New Radio (NR) frame
structure.


A. Slot and Symbol-Based Implementation


In Fig. 3(a), we show the 5G frame structure where a frame
of duration 10ms has 10 subframes of 1ms duration each.
In this paper, we consider the subcarrier spacing ∆f to be
120kHz and each subframe has 8 slots of 125µs [1] . Each slot
is occupied by 14 OFDM symbols [43]. After performing N point IFFT on the subcarrier data and adding a cyclic prefix,
the number of sampling points becomes N + NCP in To
duration. In Fig. 3(b), we present two ways of incorporating
the chirp: a slot-based and a symbol-based one. Introducing
a single chirp for the whole slot leads to an increase in the
maximum unambiguous range, as the duration of the chirp will
be 14To, corresponding to 14 OFDM symbols. The slot-based


1120kHz subcarrier spacing is used for illustration in this paper; the
methodology is applicable to other configurations as well.



implementation will also improve the velocity estimation, as
the Cram´er–Rao lower bound for Doppler estimation shows
that increasing the observation duration reduces the velocity
estimation error and thus directly improves the Doppler resolution [38]. Our results show that introducing the chirp in
the time slot significantly improves the SNR and hence also
improves the RMSE of range estimation. The symbol-based
implementation increases the maximum unambiguous velocity
estimation. The hybrid implementation is a combination of the
slot-level and symbol-level implementations within the same
subframe. As illustrated in Fig. 3(c), in an eight-slot subframe
we apply the chirp across the entire first slot following the
slot-level mode to increase the unambiguous range, and in the
second slot we confine the chirp to a single OFDM symbol
following the symbol-level mode to widen the unambiguous
velocity estimation window for fast moving targets. The remaining slots can either repeat this pair in the order of full
slot followed by single symbol across the subframe or adapt
this pattern as needed, such as a full slot in slots 0 and 4
and a single symbol in slots 1 and 5, while the OFDM frame
structure and the scheduled data subcarriers remain unchanged.


B. CM-OFDM enhancing PRS performance


Fig. 4 shows a single 5G NR resource block (RB), comprising 12 consecutive subcarriers over 14 OFDM symbols
with each cell representing a resource element (RE). Resource
blocks (RBs) are aggregated to form the resource grid (RG),
which is the complete two-dimensional array of all resource
elements over frequency and time, as detailed in [43]. The
CM-OFDM scheme can be incorporated into the existing timefrequency RBs of conventional OFDM systems, for enhancing
the PRS performance through improved range resolution. This
will be validated by the ambiguity function analysis presented
later in Section IV-A. Fig. 4 presents an example of a PRS
comb 4 based mapping comprising four symbols [38], illustrating how a chirp is applied to the OFDM symbol that serves as
the PRS symbol within the existing time–frequency structure.
Since our CM-OFDM design equation (11) is capable of
assigning this waveform to selected OFDM resource elements,
we can ensure that it consistently occupies the same position,
where the PRS is located across the grid.

C. Flexibility offered by AAC-OFDM


Some applications require high range resolution, while
others benefit from maximum unambiguous velocity. AACOFDM offers an enhanced solution because it can be integrated into OFDM RBs in various configurations. Fig. 5 shows
the flexibility of the AAC-OFDM, which can be exploited
for improving the sensing performance. In Fig. 5, Block A
is shown for a single RB, and it can be extended for the
entire RG to use all the frequency resources in one RG of
one symbol, which provides the best range resolution and
the maximum unambiguous velocity, which can be verified
from Table II. Explicitly, in Table II we show the sensing
performance metrics for the different configurations shown in
Fig. 5. Similarly, Block B in Fig. 5 is particularly suitable for
scenarios in which maximizing the unambiguous range is the
primary design requirement, where increasing the time duration of the chirp increases the maximum unambiguous range.
Block C in Fig. 5 allows flexible adjustment of the number of
subcarriers versus the symbol duration, making it the optimal
choice for customized resource allocations. Observe in Table
II that when extending the number of subcarriers and symbols
according to Block C, we can achieve the best performance for
all the sensing metrics. Block D adopts square time-frequency
resources, and this configuration can be reduced to a single RE,
as well as extended to all the symbols. Nonetheless, because
the time–frequency slope (i.e., chirp rate) remains constant,
the receiver can employ a single, fixed matched-filter based
dechirping architecture simply by updating the chirp’s start
and end frequencies and the corresponding time window to
accommodate different time–frequency configurations.
When the chirp is introduced in a single symbol along
with Bc = N ∆f then it improves the range resolution. By
contrast, when it introduces M symbols, Tc = MTo increases
the maximum unambiguous range by a factor of M . Hence,
the achievable range resolution, the maximum unambiguous
range Rmax, and the maximum unambiguous velocity can be



written as

c λ
∆R = Rmax = [cf][s][mT][o] |vmax| < .(54)
2n∆f [,] 4n∆f [,] 4mTo


In Fig. 2 we show that the receiver dechirps before OFDM
demodulation, so the communications branch is that of a
standard OFDM receiver. Residual carrier frequency offset
(CFO), common phase error (CPE), and phase noise-induced
inter-carrier interference are then handled as in conventional
OFDM [46], [47]. On the sensing branch before dechirping,
oscillator phase noise degrades coherent integration and raises
the background noise in the range–Doppler map, making
peaks wider. Hence, weak/close targets are harder to separate

[48]. This mainly reduces accuracy without changing the
nominal resolutions, which are set by bandwidth and coherent processing time [49]. Practically, we keep measurements
phase-aligned across the coherent processing interval (CPI) by
estimating and removing the slowly varying common phase
term of each symbol. If needed, we apply very light PNaware smoothing, preserving the usual FFT pipeline [50]. A
small residual CFO on the sensing chain is indistinguishable
from true Doppler, giving fˆd = fd + ε and a velocity
bias of ∆v = (λ/2) ε, while the delay over a CPI remains
essentially unchanged [51], [52]. This can be mitigated by
estimating this residual tone and derotating before Doppler
estimation (or reusing the communications CFO estimate), and
by maintaining Tx/Rx clock alignment to remove the bias at
its source [53]. Asynchronous impairments arising from clock
drift or a small sampling-rate offset accumulate across the CPI,
producing a residual delay error and range bias ∆R ≈ c ∆t/2,
while weakening coherent integration [54], [55]. This can be
addressed using a pilot-aided re-anchoring method [56], and
then coherent integration. But again, the existing FFT-based
pipeline is preserved. Importantly, the quantities ε and ∆t
model the effective frequency and timing mismatch between
the transmitter and receiver in both monostatic and bistatic
operation. In the bistatic case, they capture the relative clock
and sampling-rate errors between base stations, so the same
analysis for ∆v and ∆R describes the impact of synchronization errors on the range–Doppler map.

and Table III represents all the parameters for the subcarrier
spacing of 120 kHz used for other simulations. The delay
profile for the multipath channel is given in Table IV. We
select FR2 at 24 GHz along with the 5G NR subcarrier spacing
∆f = 120 kHz to model urban sensing and communications in city corridors and intersections. At this carrier, a
speed of 30 m/s induces a Doppler shift of about 4.8 kHz,
which is far lower than 120 kHz, so the OFDM subcarrier
orthogonality is preserved and Doppler is cleanly observable

[58]. With Nc = 1024 subcarriers the occupied bandwidth is
122.88 MHz, yielding range resolution of ∆R ≈ 1.22 m, when
the chirp spans the full band, while keeping the sampling rate
consistent with NR signal models. The channel uses a five-tap
decaying power profile with path delays from 0 to 65 ns to
represent short-delay-spread FR2 links [59], and the 0.57 µs
cyclic prefix exceeds the approximately 65 ns excess delay
to suppress inter-symbol interference. These settings keep the
simulations standards-aligned and ensure that both range and
velocity are observable under realistic urban conditions.
We utilize the classic correlation algorithm for estimating

the range and velocity. First, we apply the correlation algorithm to each symbol, where the time delay can be evaluated
by identifying the lag of the maximum correlation peak. Then,
to determine the velocity, we first collect the complex samples
zm for the selected range bin across the OFDM symbols in
the CPI and unwrap their phases φm = arg(zm) to eliminate
discontinuities. The differences between successive unwrapped
phases, ∆φm = φm+1 − φm, are averaged to obtain a Doppler
frequency estimatec f [ˆ] d, and the velocity is then quantified using
vˆ = fˆd [42]. For both CM-OFDM and OFDM we use
2fc

the transmitted symbol as a reference to obtain the sensing
information. For AAC-OFDM, the sensing information can
be extracted solely from the receiver’s knowledge of the
chirp rate. This characteristic offers the potential advantage
of leveraging the OFDM symbol for data transmission rather
than dedicating it exclusively to sensing functions, thereby
making it an eminently suitable waveform for bistatic sensing
scenarios.


A. Communication Performance

In Fig. 6, we show the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of PAPR for three distinct waveforms:
OFDM, AAC-OFDM and CM-OFDM. The PAPR is an essential metric in communication systems, representing the ratio
of peak power to average power of a signal. The simulation
parameters consist of N = 256 for the data subcarriers, and
the rest of the parameters are presented in Table III. AACOFDM exhibits a substantial reduction in PAPR compared to
OFDM. We report quantitative values at CCDF = 10 [−][3] . At
this operating point, OFDM and CM-OFDM have a PAPR of
about 11 dB and AAC-OFDM about 10.9 dB, 10.1 dB, and

power is allocated to the chirp. CM-OFDM demonstrates
comparable BER performance to conventional OFDM. These
results underscore the significance of optimizing α for AACOFDM to improve the BER performance, while indicating that
CM-OFDM exhibits similar performance to OFDM. Fig. 9

9 dB for α = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, respectively. This improvement indicates that the affine addition of the chirp function
effectively smoothens the signal strength envelope, thereby
reducing the likelihood of high peaks. By contrast, CM-OFDM
has a PAPR performance that is similar to that of standard
OFDM. This suggests that the multiplicative chirp amalgam
does not facilitate PAPR reduction in a manner analogous to
chirp addition. The results indicate that AAC-OFDM has the
potential to improve PAPR, establishing it as an appealing
candidate for power-efficient communication systems.
The time-domain waveforms of AAC-OFDM and CMOFDM are depicted in Fig. 7, offering additional insights into
their respective PAPR characteristics. For AAC-OFDM, the
addition of a chirp signal produces a waveform exhibiting a
smoother and more structured envelope compared to the other
waveform. The introduction of periodicity through the addition
of chirps mitigates abrupt fluctuations in the amplitude of the
signal, thereby facilitating a PAPR reduction. The structured
envelope has a more stable power level for the signal, thus
mitigating significant peaks. By contrast, the waveform CMOFDM exhibits an erratic structure, similar to that of the
conventional OFDM waveform.
The BER of the multipath channel is illustrated in Fig. 8,
where we show the results for different weighting factors
of α = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 for AAC-OFDM. We employ forward
error correction (FEC) using a standard 1/2-rate convolutional
code with generator polynomials (171, 133) in octal notation
with hard-decision Viterbi decoding. This improves the BER
performance under multipath and noise. Observe that AACOFDM behaves similarly to conventional OFDM for reduced
α values, with α = 0.1 achieving the minimal BER. As α
grows to 0.3 and 0.5, the BER degrades since more transmit

and AAC-OFDM for different weighting factors α. OFDM and CM-OFDM

shows the spectral efficiency versus Eb/N0 for OFDM, CM–
OFDM, and AAC–OFDM. In OFDM and CM–OFDM, 25%
of subcarriers are reserved as pilots for sensing, which imposes
a fixed throughput loss and yields plateaus at high Eb/N0 of
1.3 bits/s/Hz. AAC–OFDM does not allocate pilot subcarriers,
so all tones carry payload data. Consequently, AAC–OFDM
achieves higher spectral efficiency across the entire Eb/N0
range. Specifically, with α = 0.1 it attains 1.7 bits/s/Hz.
Increasing α to 0.3 and 0.5 shifts the operating point to
higher Eb/N0 and reduces the maximum achievable spectral
efficiency because more transmit power is devoted to the
chirp used for sensing. The receiver architecture proposed in
Fig. 2 guarantees that the added chirp does not impair the
communication link. After dechirping, the FFT demodulator
operates on a standard OFDM signal, so the communication
chain experiences no interference from the chirp, regardless
of whether it is applied to a single symbol or to an entire slot.
Thus, the choice of symbol-level versus slot-level chirp design primarily affects sensing accuracy, while communication
reliability remains essentially unchanged.


B. Sensing Performance


The ambiguity function of the OFDM waveform is shown
in Fig. 10. Fig. 10(a) shows that it is characterized by a

single sharp peak at the origin and near-zero values elsewhere.
This shape indicates that the waveform succeeds in precisely
distinguishing targets having different ranges and velocities.
This is achieved by minimizing ambiguities in both delay
and Doppler measurements. Fig. 10(b) shows that the contour
of the OFDM ambiguity function is ellipsoidal, with the
vertices along the axes determining the range resolution. With
N = 128 and of one-symbol CPI, the delay main lobe yields
∆τ ≈ 0.066 µs, giving a range resolution ∆R = 9.89 m
for the bandwidth employed. We use a single symbol so
the time is identical across waveforms, and the plots reflect
the waveform’s intrinsic behavior. The Doppler resolution
is determined by the symbol duration, and hence for all
three waveforms have ∆fd ≈ 11.17 × 10 [4] Hz as shown
in Fig. 10(b), Fig. 11(b) and Fig. 12(b). For a longer CPI
of M = 128 symbols, the Doppler resolution tightens to
∆fd ≈ 11.17 × 10 [4] /128 = 872.66 Hz, which at 24 GHz
gives ∆v ≈ (λ/2) ∆fd ≈ 5.45 m/s. The ambiguity function
of CM-OFDM is plotted in Fig. 11, where Fig. 11(a) shows
that the ambiguity function has a thumbtack and a tilted
shape, representing both the inherited quality of OFDM and
the chirp. The tilt depicted in Fig. 11(b) is due to delayDoppler coupling. The tilt provides improved resolution in
the zero-delay cut. Since typical Doppler shifts are much
smaller compared to the waveform’s bandwidth, the peak
values of non-zero Doppler cuts and hence the peak values
of the matched filter outputs decrease only slightly when
moving targets are observed. This behavior of the ambiguity
function is what makes the linear FM waveform Doppler
tolerant. With N = 128 and a one-symbol CPI, the ambiguity
plot shows a tighter delay focus than OFDM. The measured
delay main lobe gives ∆τ ≈ 0.050 µs, hence the range
resolution is ∆R ≈ 7.50 m. The tilt not only improves the
Doppler tolerance, but also improves the delay resolution [17].
Fig. 12 represents the ambiguity function of the AAC-OFDM.
Fig. 12(a) shows the sharper thumbtack model along with tilt,
which improves the range resolution along with the Doppler
tolerance. In Fig. 12(b) the narrow contour represents a better
range resolution for the proposed waveform. With N = 128
and a one-symbol CPI, the ambiguity plot shows the sharpest
delay focus among the three waveforms. The measured delay
main lobe gives ∆τ ≈ 0.028 µs, hence the range resolution
is ∆R ≈ 4.20 m.
Fig. 13(a) and Fig. 13(b) show the RMSE performance

for different waveforms while considering two distinct cases:
the incorporation of the chirp signal within a single OFDM
symbol and its incorporation across an entire slot. In both
sets of results, we assume that CM-OFDM and OFDM are
using all the subcarriers as a pilot to carry out sensing.
Fig. 13(a) focuses on the RMSE performance when the chirp
is introduced for a single OFDM symbol. At low SNRs (e.g.,
-30 to -15 dB), all waveforms have significantly higher RMSE
values due to their inability to effectively mitigate noise but
achieve a sharper RMSE reduction as the SNR increases,
especially in the moderate SNR region. The AAC-OFDM
waveform utilizes only the chirp rate β at the receiver side,
while preserving all data bits for communication purposes.
As a result, it exhibits a performance degradation of approximately 5 dB compared to other waveforms. However,
both CM-OFDM and standard OFDM harness all symbols as
pilot symbols, using the waveform solely for sensing purposes
without carrying any communication data. Fig. 13(b) shows
the RMSE performance when the chirp is applied across an
entire slot of multiple symbols. The results show a significant
improvement in RMSE compared to the single symbol case for
all schemes, owing to the noise-averaging effect of multiple
symbols. Both pure Chirp and CM-OFDM achieve the lowest
RMSE, while AAC-OFDM also benefits from the slot-based
approach, showing notable improvements in the moderate and
low SNR regions. Fig. 13(c) compares the performance of
CM-OFDM and OFDM using only 10% and 25% of pilot
subcarriers for sensing instead of using all the subcarriers.
Our proposed AAC-OFDM system, which performs sensing
without relying on a pilot subcarrier and outperforms other
waveforms, is an ideal candidate for simultaneously implementing both sensing and communication functionalities.
Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 show the RMSE of the range estimation,
comparing OFDM with AAC-OFDM for different weighting
factors (α = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8). In Fig. 14, the weighting factor
α significantly influences the RMSE performance of AACOFDM as compared to OFDM. For example, for α = 0.2 there
is a notable 15 dB SNR loss relative to OFDM, while α = 0.5
reduces this loss to approximately 5 dB. However, increasing
α degrades the BER, indicating a trade-off between sensing
accuracy and communication reliability. To strike a compelling
trade-off in both domains, the value of α must be carefully
optimized. This highlights the critical role of parameter tuning
in hybrid waveforms like AAC-OFDM for ensuring effective
integration of sensing and communication functionalities.

Fig. 15, characterizes slot-wise incorporation. Observe that
the performance of AAC-OFDM improves overall for all
values α due to the averaging effect across multiple symbols.
Notably, for α = 0.8 and α = 0.5, AAC-OFDM outperforms standard OFDM in terms of its RMSE performance,
highlighting the benefits of a stronger chirp contribution in
the slot-based approach. For example, for α = 0.3 the
performance becomes comparable to that of OFDM, but for
α = 0.2 it is still unable to outperform OFDM. Despite this,
the overall improvement across all configurations underscores
the efficiency of slot-based symbol diversity in enhancing the
sensing performance of AAC-OFDM.

the four waveforms. The performance of the chirp waveform

is superior to all the waveforms, while the velocity resolution
of the AAC-OFDM and chirp was better than that of OFDM
and CM-OFDM. The curves follow the estimator each receiver
uses as a phase reference. At high SNR, the velocity error
floors are about 0.011 m/s for chirp, 0.02 m/s for AAC-OFDM,
and 0.38–0.40 m/s for OFDM and CM-OFDM. The small gap
between chirp and AAC-OFDM is expected, because AAC
uses a data-independent chirp template across pulses, which
keeps the inter-pulse phase slope almost as clean as pure
chirp, with a slight penalty from residual OFDM leakage into
the chirp path that slightly perturbs sensing. Overall, AACOFDM reaches near-chirp Doppler accuracy around 0.02 m/s
while still carrying data, and it clearly outperforms OFDM
and CM-OFDM once the SNR is moderate to high. Fig. 17


shows the effect of the alpha factor on the RMSE of the
velocity estimate. Here α is the transmit power allocated to
the chirp component that the AAC correlator uses for sensing.
Increasing α strengthens the coherent component seen by
the matched filter, increases the effective sensing SNR, and
reduces Doppler variance. For α = 0.8 the transition from
noise-limited to estimation-limited occurs near −12 dB and
the high-SNR floor is about 3 × 10 [−][3] m/s. With α = 0.5 the
transition is around −5 dB and the floor is about 1×10 [−][2] m/s.
With α = 0.3 the transition appears near +5 dB and the floor
settles around 2 × 10 [−][2] to 3 × 10 [−][2] m/s. With α = 0.2 the
curve remains largely noise-limited even at high SNR and the
velocity error stays close to one metre per second. Intuitively,
the OFDM part acts as self-interference for the chirp matched
filter, so allocating more power to the chirp produces a cleaner
inter-pulse phase progression and a lower error floor. From a
design standpoint, α between 0.3 and 0.5 achieves sub-0.02
m/s accuracy with balanced data performance, while α near
0.8 is preferable when sensing accuracy is the priority.
AAC-OFDM is most suitable for opportunistic and bistatic
sensing, since the α parameter provides a simple control to
the sensing vs. communications trade-off. A high α can be
used during initial detection to maximize sensing performance,
which can then be reduced for steady tracking to improve
data rate and BER. The alpha value can be increased again
if the SNR or sensing performance degrades. By contrast,
CM-OFDM is better suited as a drop-in enhancement for
existing OFDM systems, as it strengthens range resolution
using known data and PRS without requiring any α tuning
or major architectural changes.


VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK


This work introduced AAC-OFDM, a novel ISAC waveform
created by affinely adding a chirp to OFDM symbols, enabling pilot-free sensing while remaining compatible with the
NR resource grid. We analysed its ambiguity characteristics
and sensing/communications trade-offs. Our formulation of
the chirp multiplication of OFDM specifies the chirp so it
fits seamlessly within the NR resource grid, i.e., it can be
inserted as a PRS or standard OFDM block without affecting
neighboring resource elements, providing a compatibilityfirst path to improved sensing. This formulation allows for
the enhancement of existing PRS/OFDM procedures without
affecting other resource elements. We showed that slot-level
chirp placement tightens range/velocity RMSE through longer
coherent integration, whereas symbol-level placement expands
the unambiguous velocity window, thereby offering a practical
way to balance resolution against Doppler tolerance. On the
communications side, AAC-OFDM can maintain BER close
to that of OFDM for modest chirp weights and can exhibit
favourable PAPR trends, while preserving OFDM-like complexity.
We will extend AAC-OFDM to MIMO, developing joint
angle, range, and Doppler processing with transmit and receive
beamforming in both single-user and multiuser MIMO, and
then evaluate the resulting sensing and communications tradeoffs. We will study robustness to hardware impairments such
as carrier frequency offset, phase noise, and power amplifier



15


nonlinearity, and relate their impact on BER and sensing
RMSE to chirp weight tuning. Finally, we will address multitarget scenarios by improving detection and tracking so that
each new measurement is matched to the correct target and its
path is kept steady over time in cluttered scenes.
