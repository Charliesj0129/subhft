Designing inclusive cycling infrastructure requires balancing the competing needs of diverse user groups, yet designers often struggle to


anticipate how different cyclists experience the same street environment. We investigate how persona-based multi-agent evaluation can


support inclusive infrastructure design by making experiential conflicts explicit during the design process. We present StreetDesignAI,


an interactive system that enables designers to (1) ground evaluation in real street context through imagery and map data, (2) receive


parallel feedback from simulated cyclist personas spanning confident to cautious users, and (3) iteratively modify designs while the


system surfaces conflicts across perspectives. A within-subjects study with 26 transportation professionals comparing StreetDesignAI


against a general-purpose AI chatbot demonstrates that structured multi-perspective feedback significantly improves designers’


understanding of new user perspectives, ability to identify diverse persona needs, and confidence in translating those needs into


inclusive design decisions. Participants also reported significantly higher overall satisfaction and stronger intention to use the system


in professional practice. Qualitative findings further illuminate how explicit conflict surfacing transforms design exploration from


single-perspective optimization toward deliberate trade-off reasoning. We discuss implications for AI-assisted tools that scaffold


inclusive design through disagreement as an interaction primitive.

**1** **INTRODUCTION**


Inclusive cycling infrastructure is widely recognized as a cornerstone of sustainable urban transportation [45, 46]. When


cities build safer and more inclusive facilities, cycling adoption increases and public health benefits follow: protected


bike lanes attract substantially more commuters than standard lanes or streets without lanes [15], and well-designed


investments need not worsen traffic congestion. Delineated bicycle lanes may also reduce crash risk and severity for


pedestrians and other road users [57]. Yet designing inclusive cycling infrastructure remains difficult in practice because


designers must negotiate competing demands, limited right-of-way, and heterogeneous public expectations.


A central challenge is that the same street design can be experienced in fundamentally different—and often conflict

ing—ways by different cyclist populations. Over 60% of urban residents report willingness to cycle but are deterred by


perceived danger in existing conditions [13, 17], while experienced cyclists may tolerate or even prefer those same


facilities for speed and flexibility. Geller’s typology highlights four cyclist groups—Strong and Fearless,” Enthused and


Confident,” Interested but Concerned,” and No Way, No How”—whose expectations for safety, comfort, and accessibility


diverge sharply [20]. The Interested but Concerned” group, representing the largest pool of latent riders, often requires


physical protection and clear separation from motor traffic, whereas Strong and Fearless” riders may prioritize direct

ness and maneuverability over protection [14]. These divergent needs create experiential conflicts (e.g., protection vs.


flexibility) that are difficult to navigate without systematic, context-grounded support.


Existing infrastructure design support methods—manuals, case databases, expert consultation, and public engage

ment—provide valuable guidance but tend to fall short exactly when conflicts matter most. Design manuals and


standards [1, 13, 38] encode best practices, yet are general-purpose and do not make visible how specific interventions


affect diverse users in a particular street context. Public engagement can surface lived experiences, but the process is


slow and participation often uneven; by the time sufficient community feedback reaches designers, major constraints

are typically fixed, leaving little room for meaningful adjustment [28]. More recently, AI-based tools have improved


visualization and automated technical tasks in urban design, including generative layout exploration [23, 47, 53],


compliance checking [59], and perception-informed optimization linking visual features to safety perception [50].


However, these tools typically assume a single, homogeneous user perspective—they help designers generate and refine


designs, but provide little support for understanding how different user groups experience the same infrastructure or


for navigating trade-offs when their needs conflict.


To address these challenges, we introduce _StreetDesignAI_, an interactive system for inclusive cycling infrastructure


design that operationalizes persona-based multi-perspective evaluation as an interaction mechanism for trade-off


reasoning. Rather than asking a general-purpose conversational model for advice, designers can use StreetDesignAI to


(1) ground evaluation in a specific street context, (2) receive parallel feedback from cyclist personas spanning confident


to cautious users, and (3) iteratively modify the design while the system surfaces conflicts and prompts targeted


follow-up inquiry. Specifically, designers begin by selecting a street location, after which the system retrieves contextual


information from OpenStreetMap and street-level imagery; the system then generates structured evaluations from four


cyclist personas, including safety, comfort, and overall bikeability ratings and concise concern summaries. Based by the


evaluation results, designers can propose modifications to the street layout via structured parameters (and optional


text), receive street-level visualizations of these proposed changes, and obtain updated persona-based evaluations that


reveal how each change impacts safety and comfort perceptions across user groups.


We evaluate StreetDesignAI through a within-subjects study of 26 street design professionals, including students and


academic researchers. Participants completed matched street redesign tasks under two conditions—StreetDesignAI and


a chatbot baseline—using a counterbalanced within-subjects design. We collected post-task questionnaires and interview


data to assess perceived exploration, understanding, confidence, and how conflict surfacing shaped exploration and


trade-off reasoning. In particular, we seek to address the following research questions:


  - **RQ1 - Exploration** : How does persona-based multi-agent evaluation support designers’ exploration of design


alternatives and reflection on persona-specific trade-offs?


  - **RQ2 - Understanding** : How does explicit conflict surfacing across simulated user perspectives influence


designers’ understanding of diverse user needs compared to general-purpose AI assistance?


  - **RQ3 - Capability & Confidence** : How does structured multi-perspective feedback influence designers’ perceived


capability and confidence in translating diverse user needs into inclusive design decisions?


The scientific contributions of this work are threefold:


  - We present StreetDesignAI, a grounded, human-informed AI design pipeline that integrates heterogeneous urban


context data (e.g., street-level imagery and spatial map data) with real user evaluations to generate persona-aware,


situated feedback for inclusive street infrastructure design.


  - We demonstrate how structuring experiential conflicts through persona-based evaluation, comparative analysis,


and visualization-driven iteration supports designers’ exploration of design alternatives and deepens their


understanding of diverse and previously underrepresented personas.


  - Through a mixed-methods, within-subjects study with 26 professional street designers, we provide empirical


evidence that StreetDesignAI improves designers’ perceived capability and confidence in identifying diverse


persona needs and translating them into inclusive infrastructure design decisions.

**2.1** **Inclusive Cycling Infrastructure Design: User Diversity and Experiential Conflict**


Cycling infrastructure design traditionally draws on standardized guidelines, expert judgment, and formal public


engagement. Authoritative manuals such as those published by NACTO [37] and AASHTO [39] provide benchmarks


for lane dimensions, separation treatments, and intersection design. Transportation research further emphasizes


cyclist heterogeneity through frameworks such as Geller’s four cyclist types [20] and the Level of Traffic Stress


(LTS) model [35], showing how traffic speed, separation, and intersection complexity disproportionately deter less


confident cyclists [19, 36]. Despite this knowledge, applying user diversity frameworks during iteration remains


challenging: typologies often stay abstract rather than becoming actionable inputs that guide concrete decisions under


constraints [56].


Community engagement methods (e.g., surveys, workshops, hearings) provide another route to incorporate lived


experience [5], and participatory design frameworks emphasize early-stage exploration of needs through contextual


inquiry and iterative prototyping with real users [4, 7]. Immersive methods such as 360° video ethnography further enable


designers to experience user contexts firsthand, supporting collaborative annotation and iterative sense-making [10, 34].


However, participation is frequently uneven and time-intensive: by the time sufficient community feedback is finally


collected and delivered to designers, key parameters have often already been fixed [28]. Critically, these approaches do


not consistently support the moment-to-moment design reasoning that inclusive infrastructure requires: surfacing


when user experiences conflict, tracing the sources of conflict in a specific context, and negotiating trade-offs before


designs harden.


**2.2** **AI-Assisted Design: Visualization, Optimization, and the Limits of Single-Perspective Support**


AI-assisted design tools have been adopted to support spatial configuration, optimization, and visualization in infrastruc

ture and urban design [23, 47, 53]. In HCI, human–AI collaboration research frames AI as a partner that complements


human judgment [9, 27], and structured workflows integrating AI into distinct design stages can outperform open-ended


conversational assistance [51, 55]. Large language models further enable natural-language interaction and ideation [31].


Yet when applied to inclusive infrastructure design, general-purpose AI tools often provide single-perspective recom

mendations and lack mechanisms to reason about conflicting lived experiences and value-laden trade-offs. Designers


can ask for advice, but the system does not inherently help them _compare_ stakeholders, _interrogate_ disagreement, or


_decide_ what to prioritize.


Visual generation models introduce new opportunities for perception-informed design research. Recent work has


explored translating textual descriptions into street-level imagery or editing street scenes through text-based instructions


to support perception studies [12, 50, 52]. However, perception research requires strict control over variables and visual


plausibility of generated content. Applying state-of-the-art image generation models to domain-specific tasks typically


demands carefully crafted prompts, parameter tuning, and iterative refinement [49], thus practitioners outside the AI


field may find it difficult to leverage these models directly for their specific needs.


**2.3** **LLM-Based User Simulation: From Multiple Perspectives to Disagreement as an Interaction Primitive**


Recent work explores using LLMs to simulate users for evaluation and feedback, including synthetic usability critique,


simulated survey responses, and role-play evaluations [2, 11, 33]. Research on Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs)


Manuscript submitted to ACM


StreetDesignAI 5


provides taxonomies for how LLMs embody diverse perspectives [8], with studies examining how narrative perspec

tive [30] and persona modality [26] affect engagement and believability. Multi-agent systems extend this by representing


multiple stakeholders [32, 60], and SimTube demonstrates that persona-driven simulation can yield feedback more


informative than actual user comments [24]. However, this literature largely focuses on generating _multiple viewpoints_


rather than making disagreement an _operational object_ . Tools like Synthia show how visual scaffolding helps users act


on feedback [58], yet primarily target textual revision. Inclusive design often fails not from lack of diverse opinions, but


from lacking mechanisms to surface and negotiate conflicts systematically.


LLM-based simulation also raises credibility concerns: models may produce generic or idealized feedback and


misrepresent marginalized users [2, 25]. Fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and structured prompting can improve


realism [43, 44, 54]. Grounding in real-world data, such as crowdsourced assessments from Project Sidewalk [48] with


AI-based quality control [29], offers one path toward credibility. Multimodal systems like StreetViewAI demonstrate


street-level imagery understanding for virtual navigation [18], and recent work explores persona-based urban safety


perception [3]. Yet most prior work remains in digital domains, whereas physical infrastructure is embodied and carries


long-term consequences. Integrating grounded personas into workflows for early-stage trade-off negotiation remains


underexplored.


StreetDesignAI addresses this gap by supporting explicit negotiation of experiential conflict during iterative infras

tructure design. By grounding persona behavior in large-scale cyclist data and coupling evaluation with visualization,


StreetDesignAI provides mechanisms for comparing, probing, and resolving disagreement under real-world constraints.


**3** **SYSTEM DESIGN**


StreetDesignAI is an interactive evaluation system for inclusive cycling infrastructure design. Our system makes


conflicts between stakeholder experiences explicit, supports targeted interrogation of why conflicts arise, and keeps


conflicts visible across iteration so designers can negotiate trade-offs.


To achieve this, StreetDesignAI couples three capabilities into one iterative workflow: (1) **grounded context**


(street-view imagery and OpenStreetMap attributes), (2) **multi-perspective evaluation** through persona-based agents


representing heterogeneous user groups, and (3) **visualization-driven iteration** through parameterized design edits


that are rendered at the street level and immediately re-evaluated. This framing distinguishes StreetDesignAI from


general-purpose conversational tools (e.g., ChatGPT), which can provide suggestions but do not inherently structure


parallel comparison, conflict surfacing, and iterative trade-off negotiation within a single workflow.


We designed StreetDesignAI through a formative study with practitioners and translated those findings into three


design goals that guide system features and architecture.


**3.1** **Formative Study: Understanding Challenges in Inclusive Cycling Infrastructure Design**


We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 professionals involved in cycling infrastructure design, including


6 traffic/roadway engineers, 3 transportation major students, 2 transportation planners/project managers, and 1


environmental leaders fellow. All 12 formative study participants later participated in our main user study. Participants


reported 1 to 10+ years of experience and involvement in 1 to 5+ cycling-related projects. Our analysis surfaced four


recurring challenges that informed system requirements.


**Challenge 1: Difficulty in perspective-taking beyond personal experience.** Most participants identified as


regular or experienced cyclists and reported difficulty empathizing with less confident populations. As P3 noted: “I bike


to work every day and feel comfortable in most conditions... but when I try to imagine how my mother would feel on


Manuscript submitted to ACM


6 Wang, et al.


the same street, I honestly don’t know what would concern her.” Participants also described limited familiarity with


cyclist typologies (e.g., P7: “I’m not very familiar with the different types of cyclists... I don’t really know about the


different levels of cyclists.”).


**Challenge 2: Delayed and limited user feedback in current workflows.** User feedback typically arrives late


(e.g., public hearings or post-implementation feedback), when major constraints are already fixed. P2 emphasized: “By


the time we get community feedback, the budget is allocated and the design is mostly fixed... fundamental changes are


nearly impossible.” Feedback is also often too coarse to support design trade-offs (P9: “People tell us they want ‘safer


bike lanes,’ but that doesn’t help us decide between a painted buffer versus physical barriers...”).


**Challenge 3: Disconnect between technical parameters and lived experience.** Participants described difficulty


translating technical specifications into felt safety/comfort. P11 stated: “I can tell you that a 5-foot bike lane with a


2-foot buffer meets NACTO standards, but I cannot tell you whether a nervous cyclist would feel safe enough to use it.”


This disconnect becomes acute under right-of-way constraints (P4: “...choose between widening lanes and improving


lane separation... I don’t have a good way to understand which matters more for which type of cyclist.”).


**Challenge 4: Limited access to diverse user perspectives.** Designers reported that engagement processes tend


to over-represent confident cyclists, while hesitant users remain unheard. P6 observed: “Our public meetings tend


to attract the same people... We rarely hear from people who don’t currently bike but might if conditions improved.”


Participants noted that even when they seek broader input, it is slow and hard to make feedback specific to hypothetical


designs.


**Current use of AI tools.** Eight participants had experimented with ChatGPT or similar tools but reported generic


feedback and lack of situated constraint-awareness (P5: “...it gives very generic advice.” P8: “...suggests ideal solutions


without acknowledging the constraints we actually face.”). Multiple participants expressed interest in tools that could


quickly test how different user types would react to design choices before committing (P12: “What I really need is a way


to quickly test how different types of cyclists would react to my design choices, before I’ve committed to anything.”).


**3.2** **Design Goals**


Based on the formative study and prior literature on inclusive design and human–AI collaboration, we derive three


design goals:


**DG1: Facilitate perspective-taking through multi-persona evaluation.** The system should enable designers to


compare heterogeneous user perspectives in parallel and keep differences visible, reducing experience substitution and


supporting explicit prioritization decisions.


**DG2: Support iterative design ideation and concept exploration through real-time visualization and**


**evaluation.** The system should compress the feedback loop by enabling designers to propose an intervention, visualize


it in context, and immediately observe how it shifts conflict patterns across stakeholders.


**DG3: Bridge technical parameters and lived experience through grounded, narrative feedback.** The system


should translate parameter choices into grounded experiential narratives and visual evidence so designers can reason


about why specific elements feel safer or riskier for different users.


**3.3** **System Overview**


StreetDesignAI alternates between **(1) grounded baseline evaluation** and **(2) design-and-re-evaluate cycles** .


Designers select a real street segment, after which the system retrieves contextual attributes (OpenStreetMap) and

StreetDesignAI 7


street-level imagery (Street View). The system then generates persona-based evaluations representing five stakeholder


perspectives:


  - **Strong & Fearless:** experienced daily cyclists prioritizing speed and efficiency


  - **Enthused & Confident:** regular cyclists balancing safety and efficiency


  - **Interested but Concerned:** cautious cyclists requiring substantial protection


  - **No Way, No How:** non-cyclists deterred by safety concerns, requiring high separation


  - **Driver:** operational driving concerns (visibility, turning, lane width, traffic flow)


For each iteration, designers specify interventions through structured parameters and optional text. The system


generates an edited street-level visualization that reflects those parameters and re-generates evaluations from all


personas. Crucially, the system also maintains and surfaces conflict structure across iterations: it highlights where


personas diverge, what design elements are driving divergence, and which tensions appear irreducible under constraints,


so designers can decide what to prioritize rather than collapsing feedback into a single score.


**3.4** **Core Features**


StreetDesignAI operationalizes disagreement-as-primitive through five integrated features, as shown in Figure 1.


_3.4.1_ _Evaluation Generation: Parallel baseline assessment from multiple perspectives (DG1, DG2)._ Upon street selection


via coordinate input, the system retrieves (1) Google Street View imagery and (2) OpenStreetMap attributes (e.g., road


class, speed limit, existing cycling infrastructure), as shown in Figure 1 (A). Each of the four cyclist personas (Strong &


Fearless, Enthused & Confident, Interested but Concerned, No Way No How) produces structured feedback including


safety scores, comfort scores, and overall ratings (1–10), along with concise observations explaining their assessment.


The system also generates driver pros and cons. This parallel evaluation establishes a baseline conflict pattern, making


divergent perspectives visible at the outset for subsequent iteration.


_3.4.2_ _Design Adjustment: Parameterized interventions and AI-rendered visualization (DG2, DG3)._ Designers propose


interventions through a Parameter Specification Panel with options for bike lane width (narrow, widen, stay the same),


lane color (green painting, no painting), buffer type (standard, bollards, armadillo), and buffer location (next to parked


cars, next to moving cars), plus optional free-text requirements, as shown in Figure 1 (B). The system uses GPT-Image-1


API to render a modified street view image based on these parameters. After visualization, the system re-runs all


persona evaluations on the new design, allowing designers to see how specific parameter changes shift safety and


comfort scores across stakeholders.


_3.4.3_ _Deep Analysis: Interrogating perspectives through conversational follow-up (DG1, DG3)._ Deep Analysis presents


each persona’s initial observations in a conversation-like format and supports multi-turn dialogue where designers


can ask follow-up questions such as why do you feel unsafe?” or what changes would improve your rating?” Personas


receive the current image and context, stay in character, reference visible street elements, and provide actionable


suggestions, as shown in Figure 1 (C). This feature helps designers unpack the mechanisms behind different ratings


(e.g., which elements trigger fear for cautious cyclists versus which features drivers find restrictive), moving beyond


opaque scores to understand the “why” behind evaluations.


_3.4.4_ _Multi-Persona Discussion: Facilitating cross-persona debate on design preferences. (DG1)._ When comparing multiple


design scenarios, the Multi-Agent Discussion tab presents persona responses discussing which design they prefer


Manuscript submitted to ACM


8 Wang, et al.


Fig. 2. System workflow of StreetDesignAI: The system consists of four main modules: (A) Evaluation Generation collects street-level
imagery from Google Street View and road attributes from OpenStreetMap, then uses a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 model to generate
safety ratings, comfort scores, and key factors for four cyclist personas and driver’s perspective; (B) Design Adjustment allows users
to configure design parameters (lane width, color, buffer type) and uses GPT-image-1 to render modified streetscapes, triggering
re-evaluation of all personas; (C) Deep Analysis supports multi-turn dialogue for in-depth analysis of design preferences across
different personas within a single scenario, with system responses prioritized by relevance; (D) Multi-Design Comparison includes
D.1 Multi-Persona Discussion for comparing design preferences across multiple scenarios, and D.2 Design Comparison Visualization
module for side-by-side rating comparison with highlighted differences.


and why. Each persona articulates their design preference with justification, referencing specific elements (e.g., buffer


zones, lane visibility, physical protection), as shown in Figure 1 (D.1). Designers can pose questions to the group,


and each persona responds in order from high to low according to the relevance of the question.. This discussion


format surfaces points of agreement, persistent disagreements, and the reasoning behind different preferences, helping


designers understand trade-offs that require prioritization rather than simple optimization.


_3.4.5_ _Design Comparison Visualization: Comparing alternatives through quantitative score profiles (DG1, DG2)._ The


Design Scenario Comparison tab enables side-by-side evaluation of the existing condition against generated design


scenarios, as shown in Figure 1 (D.2). For each persona, the system displays bar charts showing safety, comfort, and


total scores across all alternatives, with each design scenario represented by a different color. The visualization also


indicates each persona’s stated preference at the top. This allows designers to quickly identify which alternatives


improve outcomes for specific user groups, where scores diverge across personas, and which design changes produce


the largest shifts in perceived safety and comfort—supporting informed decision-making without collapsing diverse


perspectives into a single metric.

**3.5** **Example Use Scenario**


Zoe is an urban planner redesigning a commercial corridor. She selects a busy arterial with on-street parking and no


dedicated cycling facility. StreetDesignAI retrieves street context and produces baseline evaluations: confident cyclists


note lack of dedicated space, while cautious personas report they would avoid cycling due to exposure to traffic. The


system highlights a baseline conflict pattern: cautious personas demand protection while confident riders and drivers


prioritize flexibility and flow.


Zoe proposes a green-painted bike lane with a painted buffer. The visualization shows updated markings and


evaluations improve for some personas, but the system indicates that core conflict remains: cautious cyclists still


perceive insufficient physical protection. Zoe enters Deep Analysis and asks the _Interested but Concerned_ persona what


would make the design usable. The persona requests physical barriers and identifies specific fear points (e.g., proximity


to moving vehicles). Zoe adds bollards along the traffic side and observes increased safety for cautious personas, while


the driver perspective raises operational concerns. The Multi-Persona Discussion panel marks this as an irreducible


trade-off, prompting Zoe to decide what to prioritize under right-of-way constraints. After exploring alternatives, Zoe


uses Design Comparison to select an option with a more acceptable conflict profile rather than simply maximizing a


single score.


**3.6** **Implementation Details**


StreetDesignAI is implemented as a web-based system with a React front end and a model-backed evaluation and


visualization pipeline. The system retrieves street-level imagery through the Google Street View API [21] and extracts


contextual street attributes through the OpenStreetMap Overpass API [42] (e.g., road type, signals, existing cycling


infrastructure, surrounding features). Designers interact with a custom canvas interface supporting pan/zoom, parameter


editing, and multi-view comparison.


For persona-based evaluation and dialogue, the system uses a GPT-4.1 model [40] fine-tuned on a crowdsourced


bikeability assessment dataset (see Section 3.7 for a detailed description) to reduce generic or idealized responses and


improve persona consistency. Each persona agent is defined by a dedicated system prompt specifying identity, priorities,


and evaluation focus. Outputs are returned in a structured JSON schema containing scores and observation points to


ensure consistency and parsability. All prompts and schemas are included in Appendix 9.


For visual generation, StreetDesignAI uses GPT-Image-1 [41] for targeted street view edits. Prompts are structured


to identify existing lane regions, apply dimensional specifications tied to selected parameters, and enforce boundary


constraints to improve fidelity.


**3.7** **Crowdsourced Bikeability Assessment Data Collection**


To address potential limitations of general-purpose LLMs on domain-specific tasks, we collected bikeability assessment


data from real cyclists to ground persona-based evaluations in empirical experience. Specifically, we developed an


interactive street rating platform that presents participants with immersive, panoramic Google Street View imagery


and asks them to rate perceived safety, comfort, and overall bikeability on 1–10 scales. Open-ended questions are also


asked to allow participants to express concerns, preferences, and improvement suggestions. The crowdsourced data


are subsequently used to fine-tune GPT-4.1, enabling persona agents to generate evaluations grounded in real cyclist


experiences.

_3.7.1_ _Recruitment And Payment._ We recruited participants through social media platforms to complete anonymous


surveys evaluating bicycle lane quality. Each survey took approximately 5 minutes to complete. To incentivize partic

ipation, we implemented a lottery-based compensation system: every 100th participant received a $100 gift card (4


participants total received compensation). This resulted in an average expected compensation of approximately $0.93


per participant, or approximately $11.16 per hour based on the estimated completion time. Participation was voluntary


and anonymous, with no personally identifiable information collected. Eventually, a total of 427 cyclists with diverse


skill levels, ages, and comfort thresholds completed the survey, yielding approximately 12,400 assessments across varied


street conditions.


Three graduate students were recruited from a public R1 doctoral research university to perform data annotation


tasks. Annotators were paid $20 per hour for approximately 8 hours of annotation work each, totaling $160 per annotator.


This compensation rate exceeds local minimum wage standards and is consistent with standard research assistant rates


at our institution.


_3.7.2_ _Survey Interface._ Figure 9 and Figure 10 show screenshots from our crowdsourcing survey platform. Figure 9


displays the immersive 360-degree Google Street View interface used for bikeability assessment, allowing participants


to explore road environments interactively. Figure 10 shows the infrastructure preference assessment interface where


participants rate their comfort levels for different cycling facility types.


**4** **STUDY DESIGN**


To evaluate StreetDesignAI’s effectiveness in supporting inclusive cycling infrastructure design, we conducted a within

subjects comparative study with 26 street designers comparing our system against a conventional AI-assisted design


approach and examining how persona-based multi-agent evaluation influences designers’ understanding of diverse


user needs and design decision-making processes.


**4.1** **Participants**


We recruited 26 participants with backgrounds in transportation engineering and planning through email outreach and


snowball sampling. Eligibility criteria required participants to have at least one year of experience in road/transportation


design or have participated in at least one project involving street design. Participants included practicing professionals


such as traffic engineers, transportation planners, and project managers (n=14), academic faculty and researchers


(n=4), graduate students (n=6), and undergraduate students (n=2). Participants had varying levels of experience in


road/transportation design (M=4.62 years, SD=4.00, range: <1 to >10 years), with 9 participants having more than 5


years of experience. They represented diverse contexts including government agencies, private industry, and academic


institutions. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 57 years (M=30.58, SD=9.85), with 18 identifying as male, 7 as female,


and 1 as nonbinary. Table 1 provides detailed demographic information.


**4.2** **Task Design**


We employed a Latin square balanced within-subjects design to control for potential learning effects. Each participant


experienced both conditions:


**Condition A - StreetDesignAI:** Participants used the full StreetDesignAI system with functions below:


  - Multi-Persona evaluation from four cyclist types and and the driver view

  - Structured parameter controls for infrastructure modifications


  - Integrated street context from OpenStreetMap


**Condition B - ChatGPT (baseline):** Participants used ChatGPT-4.1 with prompt template that provided street


context and requested design recommendations. This baseline represents current practice in AI-assisted road design


consultation, where designers might seek general AI guidance without persona-specific perspectives. We selected


ChatGPT as our baseline because it is the most widely adopted AI assistant among design professionals (8 of 12 formative


study participants had used it), and no existing AI tools specifically support multi-perspective cycling infrastructure


evaluation.


For each condition, participants were tasked with improving cycling infrastructure at real street locations. Participants


were free to select any real street location they wished to improve.


**4.3** **Study Procedure**


The study procedure followed a structured protocol as illustrated in Figure 3. Each session began with participants


completing a pre-study survey assessing their baseline design confidence and understanding of diverse cyclist needs


using adapted items from established scales (e.g., “I understand how different types of cyclists experience the same


infrastructure,” “I feel confident designing for users whose needs differ from my own”).

Fig. 3. Study workflow: participants completed five phases: (1) pre-study survey on design confidence; (2-3) two design tasks using
StreetDesignAI and ChatGPT in counterbalanced order, each with post-task surveys; (4) comparative reflection; and (5) semi-structured
interview on system experiences and AI’s role in inclusive design. Total session time averaged 95 minutes.


After viewing a brief introduction video about the study objectives (without revealing specific hypotheses), par

ticipants proceeded to the first design task. They were instructed to think aloud while exploring design alternatives,


documenting their process through screenshots of the three most useful insights or design iterations. This think-aloud


protocol provided rich qualitative data about their design reasoning and how they interpreted system feedback.


Following the first condition, participants completed a mid-study survey measuring:


  - **Understanding of diverse needs:** Perceived insight into different cyclist perspectives


  - **Design confidence:** Self-efficacy in creating inclusive solutions


  - **System usability:** Ease of use and interaction quality


  - **Trust in feedback:** Credibility of AI-generated evaluations


Participants then repeated the design task using the alternate system, followed by the same assessment battery. The


session concluded with a 30-minute semi-structured interview exploring their comparative experiences, perceived


value of persona-based feedback, and reflections on AI’s role in inclusive design practice.


**4.4** **Data Collection and Analysis**


We collected multiple forms of data to triangulate findings:


**Interaction logs:** System telemetry captured all design iterations, parameter modifications, and time spent on


different activities. For StreetDesignAI, this included persona feedback viewed, design parameters modified, and iteration


patterns. For ChatGPT, we logged conversation turns and design topics discussed.


**Survey responses:** Likert-scale responses were analyzed using paired t-tests to compare conditions, with Bonferroni


correction for multiple comparisons. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated to assess practical significance.


**Interview transcripts:** Following Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis framework [6], two researchers indepen

dently coded interview transcripts, identifying patterns in how designers perceived and utilized persona-based feedback.


Initial codes were generated inductively, then organized into themes aligned with our research questions. Discrepancies


were resolved through discussion until consensus was reached.


**5** **RESULTS**


We report results organized by the three research questions. Across all analyses, we combine quantitative survey results


with qualitative interview data from 26 participants. For comparisons between StreetDesignAI and ChatGPT, we used


Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. For StreetDesignAI-specific features, we report descriptive statistics and one-sample tests


against the neutral midpoint. Qualitative findings are used to contextualize and explain observed quantitative patterns.

Note: W and p-values represent Wilcoxon signed-rank test results comparing
paired participant ratings between ChatGPT and StreetDesignAI.


Participants reported comparable levels of baseline usability and interaction intuitiveness for ChatGPT and StreetDes

ignAI, with no statistically significant differences observed between the two systems (Table 2). However, participants


rated all StreetDesignAI-specific features significantly above the neutral midpoint (M=3), indicating strong perceived


support for design exploration, rapid iteration, and trade-off reflection. The Generate Evaluation (M=4.31, SD=0.79) and


Comparative Analysis (M=4.46, SD=0.71) functions received the highest ratings (Figure 4).


Fig. 4. Distribution of participant ratings for four key system functions (N=26). All functions rated above neutral midpoint.


Participants repeatedly emphasized that StreetDesignAI’s structured interface and interaction model reduced friction


in exploration. As P12 noted: “I think that was pretty intuitive. It gave you the image, what’s wrong with it, and


what these various users would probably think. The scoring system was clear and easy to understand.” This structure


contrasted with ChatGPT’s text-heavy flow. P5 explained: “The interface on the website is much more intuitive


than ChatGPT. It allows you to view each scenario more clearly as its own section instead of scrolling through text.”


Participants also highlighted the efficiency of button-based interactions. As P5 further elaborated: “Instead of filling out


a text box, selecting buttons is much more efficient. The structured approach helps organize my thinking.”


**5.1** **RQ1 - Exploration of Design Alternatives**


_5.1.1_ _Visual Generation and Iteration Speed._ Rapid visualization enabled designers to explore alternatives early in the


workflow. P6 observed that “within maybe 1-2 minutes, we can visualize changes from existing conditions to proposed


Manuscript submitted to ACM


14 Wang, et al.


improvements. That speed is really valuable for early design exploration.” P25 similarly praised the generative capability:


“The image generation is super good. Getting a realistic visualization that quickly is incredibly valuable for concept


development.” This speed also supported practical constraints in professional contexts. P12 noted: “If I were in a rush to


a meeting and needed to present design concepts, generating these images would be incredibly helpful. Much faster


than Illustrator or Photoshop.”


Participants described the exploration value of visual generation as democratizing and communicative. P1 stated:


“This image capability is extremely useful. Not everyone can draw, and even those who can can’t produce realistic


renderings this fast.” P16 emphasized stakeholder communication: “the renderings even make the street look more


beautiful...it helps sell the vision to stakeholders.” While acknowledging limitations, participants still found the feature


useful for early-stage exploration. P5 offered: “Image generation has room for improvement, but the current capability is


already useful for concept-level discussions.” and P18 added: “right-of-way constraints aren’t always reflected accurately,


but for preliminary concepts, the visualizations are valuable.”


_5.1.2_ _Persona Evaluation Quality._ Evaluation and comparison features supported explicit reflection on persona-specific


trade-offs. Participants valued the evaluation function’s fidelity to environmental cues and safety trade-offs. P3 noted:


“the observations about cars are pretty good...how they affect drivers’ speed and the hazard of door zones when


someone’s biking by.” and continued: “The observation about trees and environmental context is impressive. It does a


good job understanding what’s actually in the environment.” P7 confirmed the plausibility of outputs: “the information


it gives makes sense. It correctly identified that there’s no bike lane and that the pavement is uneven.” The speed


advantage over manual work was salient. P1 stated: “the AI-generated pros and cons are impressive. It captures the key


tradeoffs I would identify manually, but much faster.” P15 highlighted comfort-level details: “picked up on subtle details


like pavement quality and sight lines that affect cyclist comfort.” Participants also noted occasional issues. P25 warned:


“Sometimes it identified bike infrastructure that wasn’t there. The false positives could be confusing for users unfamiliar


with the location.”


_5.1.3_ _Comparative Analysis and Trade-off Reflection._ Comparative analysis further strengthened trade-off reflection


across alternatives. P10 appreciated presentation: “the color coding that highlights certain keywords makes it easy to


quickly compare feedback across different design scenarios.” and also emphasized quantified deltas: “Seeing the safety


score change from 3 to 5 after adding bollards gives clear, quantifiable feedback on design improvements.” P3 connected


comparison with persona discussions: “I love the discussions between personas and the comparative analysis. Being


able to see how each group responds to changes is very useful.” P2 found comparisons cognitively supportive: “having


a basic idea in my head, this gives me a more intuitive comparison than I could do mentally. Visualizing the tradeoffs is


powerful.” P16 described prioritization utility: “helped me understand which design elements had the biggest impact on


different user groups. Very useful for prioritization.”


_5.1.4_ _Design Parameter Choices._ Analysis of 48 design scenarios across 26 sessions revealed consistent patterns in


parameter selection (Figure 5). Green painted lanes were overwhelmingly preferred (85.4%, 41/48 designs) over unpainted


alternatives (14.6%, 7/48). Physical separation through narrow bollards (35.4%, 17/48) and armadillo dividers (29.2%,


14/48) were collectively chosen in 64.6% of designs, exceeding standard painted buffers (27.1%, 13/48) and minimal


buffering (8.3%, 4/48). Most participants selected wider lanes (47.9%, 23/48) over maintaining existing width (37.5%,


18/48) or narrowing (14.6%, 7/48). Buffers were more frequently placed adjacent to parked cars (62.5%, 30/48) than


moving traffic (37.5%, 18/48).

Fig. 5. Frequency of design parameter selections across 48 design scenarios: (a) lane width, (b) lane color, (c) buffer type, (d) buffer
location.


The convergence on green paint (85.4%) and physical barriers (combined 64.6%) indicates that visibility and protection


emerged as dominant design principles. As P12 explained during design exploration: “The green makes it unmistakably


clear where cyclists should be, and the bollards give that physical reassurance that cars can’t drift into the lane.” The


preference for parked-car-side buffering aligns with participants’ explicit concerns about dooring hazards, as noted by


P8: “The buffer next to parked cars is essential. I’ve seen too many door-zone incidents to skimp on that protection.”


The diversity of parameter combinations (48 design solutions) demonstrates that StreetDesignAI supported flexible


exploration while revealing consistent strategic priorities.


_5.1.5_ _In-Depth Analysis and Follow-up Interaction._ The in-depth analysis enabled deeper exploration. P18 stated: “the


feature I like most. Seeing how different risk perception groups respond to the same design is fascinating and useful.”


P1 highlighted interactivity: “you can follow up with questions and dig deeper into specific concerns. The interactivity


adds value.” P2 emphasized actionable guidance: “provides more practical, actionable information. When I asked about


separation, it suggested specific buffer types and dimensions.” Participants also proposed refinements to increase realism


and persona fidelity. P25 suggested: “the second agent could better consider the output of the first agent. More true


back-and-forth dialogue would increase realism.” and P18 noted: “The ‘strong and fearless’ persona could be less focused


on physical barriers since they’re supposed to be comfortable with less protection.”

_5.2.1_ _Comparative Understanding Outcomes._ StreetDesignAI significantly outperformed ChatGPT in helping partici

pants understand perspectives they had not previously considered in street design (W=43.5, _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 031), with mean


Manuscript submitted to ACM


16 Wang, et al.


ratings increasing from 3.46 to 4.04 (Table 3). StreetDesignAI also led to significantly higher overall satisfaction (3.38 to


3.85, W=24.0, _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 034) and stronger intention to use the system in professional work (2.88 to 3.62, W=46.0, _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 025).


While participants rated persona feedback from StreetDesignAI as more authentic than ChatGPT (3.31 to 3.77), this


difference did not reach statistical significance ( _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 070).


Fig. 6. Distribution of safety, comfort, and overall suitability scores across four cyclist personas (N=78 evaluations from 26 sessions).


_5.2.2_ _Persona Score Distributions and Experiential Divergence._ Analysis of 78 evaluations (30 existing conditions +


48 design scenarios) revealed systematic divergence in how different personas rated infrastructure (Figure 6). Strong


& Fearless (M=6.90, SD=1.08) and Enthused & Confident (M=6.91, SD=1.22) cyclists rated scenarios similarly, with


median overall scores around 7 and relatively compact distributions. In contrast, Interested but Concerned cyclists


showed substantially lower scores (M=5.58, SD=1.76) with high variability, indicating that this group’s experience is


highly sensitive to design choices. No Way No How cyclists rated nearly all scenarios below 4 (M=3.02, SD=1.23), with


minimal variation across scenarios. The 3.9-point gap between confident cyclists (M≈6.9) and the most cautious group


(M=3.02) quantifies the magnitude of experiential conflict that designers must navigate.


P18’s design session exemplifies this divergence: on a Chicago street with existing bike lanes, Strong & Fearless rated


safety at 9/10, while No Way No How rated it only 3/10—a 6-point gap on identical infrastructure. As P18 reflected after


viewing such contrasts: “Seeing how different risk perception groups react to the same design really changed how I


think about inclusive infrastructure. I used to design for the average cyclist, but there’s no such thing.” The Interested


but Concerned group’s high variance (SD=1.76, the largest among all personas) reveals substantial opportunity for


design interventions to improve their experience, positioning this population as a critical target for infrastructure


improvements.


_5.2.3_ _Surfacing Overlooked Perspectives._ Participants described how StreetDesignAI’s persona-based structure surfaced


overlooked perspectives and contextual nuance. P4 described: “perspectives I hadn’t considered. For example, it was


the only one to acknowledge the available sidewalk as an alternative for cautious cyclists.” P18 similarly emphasized:


“Seeing how different risk perception groups react to the same design really changed how I think about inclusive


infrastructure.” Participants also identified how the persona framing filled gaps in typical design practice. P3 explained:


“The personas are really useful because I don’t usually think about different cyclist comfort levels when doing road


design.”


7 participants highlighted that StreetDesignAI helped them reason about trade-offs in perspective understanding. P1


observed that the persona system “can remind you that a certain design might actually make some user groups feel


Manuscript submitted to ACM


StreetDesignAI 17


worse, even when overall scores improve. That’s a critical insight.” Beyond personas, the system prompted consideration


of contextual factors. P5 noted that it “It made me think about weather in ways I hadn’t really considered before, like


how rain or snow can affect lane markings and surface traction.”


_5.2.4_ _Contextual and Situational Understanding._ Participants also described understanding as situational and context

dependent rather than fixed. P15 stated: “People can be in multiple categories depending on context. I was a very different


cyclist when riding with my younger children. The tool captures that nuance.” P5 reframed a persona interpretation:


“the ‘no way, no how’ persona is like a mother’s perspective of a child taking this route to school... That’s a real


user group we need to design for.” The system also helped calibrate how much change is needed to shift perceptions.


P4 reported: “people who are worried about cycling risk won’t be convinced by minor improvements, they need


substantial infrastructure changes.” Some participants noted that the system expanded their attention beyond cyclist

only perspectives. P1 admitted: “Before using the tool, I rarely read through driver perspectives carefully. But the driver


section gave very useful suggestions that made me reconsider my design approach.” For experienced cyclists serving as


designers, the system provided a corrective lens. P7 reflected: “As someone who’s comfortable on most roads, I tend to


forget how intimidating they can be for less confident cyclists.”


Fig. 7. Mean safety and comfort scores by persona and scenario type (evaluation vs. design). Color intensity indicates score magnitude
(red = lower, green = higher).


_5.2.5_ _Design Intervention Effectiveness Across Personas._ Comparing existing condition evaluations against design


scenario proposals revealed differential responsiveness to interventions (Figure 7). Design scenarios consistently


received higher scores than evaluations across most personas, demonstrating that proposed interventions improved


perceived safety and comfort. However, improvement magnitude varied substantially: Interested but Concerned


showed measurable gains in comfort (5.13 in evaluations → 5.30 in designs, +0.17), while No Way No How showed no


improvement and slight declines (safety: 3.74 → 3.67; comfort: 2.97 → 2.91). Strong & Fearless and Enthused & Confident


personas showed modest improvements, reflecting their baseline comfort with existing infrastructure. The persistent


stratification—confident cyclists rating 3+ points higher than cautious cyclists even in improved designs—underscores


the challenge of achieving universal satisfaction through standard protected lane treatments.


The heatmap pattern reveals a key trade-off: interventions that meaningfully improve conditions for moderately


cautious cyclists (Interested but Concerned) may still fail to attract the most risk-averse group. As P15 observed: “Even


with physical barriers, some people just won’t feel safe sharing road space with cars. They need complete separation,


like a sidepath or protected cycle track.” This finding has important implications for infrastructure investment: standard


protected lanes can expand the cycling population by converting Interested but Concerned individuals into riders,


Manuscript submitted to ACM


18 Wang, et al.


but may never achieve truly universal access without grade-separated facilities. The sensitivity pattern suggests that


designers must explicitly decide which populations to prioritize under resource and right-of-way constraints.


_5.2.6_ _Perceived Authenticity and Credibility._ Perceived authenticity of persona feedback emerged as an important


qualitative theme for interpreting understanding benefits. P5 observed: “the personas stay pretty true to their perspective.


The ‘no way, no how’ and ‘interested but concerned’ especially feel authentic.” and added: “It mimics a real person pretty


accurately. If you compared these responses to real survey data, I think you’d find significant overlap in the concerns


raised.” P2 suggested that predictability enhanced credibility: “The responses are fairly predictable given each persona’s


profile, which actually increases credibility. They say things consistent with their character.” Even when participants


detected AI-like patterns, they prioritized substantive value. P18 summarized: “You can tell it’s AI-generated if you read


carefully, but the substance of the feedback is valid and useful regardless of the source.”


_5.2.7_ _Qualitative Explanations and Professional Workflow Integration._ Finally, participants emphasized that under

standing was improved by qualitative explanations rather than numeric scores alone. P25 stated that “the qualitative


comparison is more insightful than just rating safety 7 versus 6. Understanding why different users feel differently is


more valuable than the numbers alone.” P5 rated the system highly for perspective-taking: “It’s Very useful...I’d rate it


nine out of ten for gaining perspective on how people might perceive a street redesign from both driver and cyclist


viewpoints.” P3 connected this understanding to stakeholder engagement: “This provides a good baseline for what


options to show people and what questions to bring up in public engagement. It helps structure the conversation.”


Participants also explained where StreetDesignAI could fit into professional workflows, clarifying why intention-to

use was higher. P16 stated: “This is a great tool for planners, especially city planners and DOTs when planning bike


lanes and expanding bikeway networks.” P4 noted its utility for “preparing to respond to public comment. If you know


your city has many cyclists, this helps you anticipate their concerns.” P12 positioned it as “...useful in the early stages of


design, when you’re deciding whether a road needs improvement but haven’t gotten into detailed plans yet. It feels like


a good starting point for exploration” P23 emphasized early-phase value: “At the very beginning of a project, this is


very useful for generating ideas about justification and basic design scenarios.” Finally, P6 summarized the resource


value: “It’s particularly valuable when you need to quickly explore multiple design alternatives before committing


resources to detailed analysis.”

_5.3.1_ _Pre-Post Capability and Confidence Changes._ Both ChatGPT and StreetDesignAI improved participants’ ability to


identify and articulate the needs of different cyclist personas, with stronger improvement observed under StreetDesignAI


Manuscript submitted to ACM


StreetDesignAI 19


(Table 4). Persona need identification increased from baseline (M=3.27, SD=1.04) to post-ChatGPT (M=3.73, SD=0.78,


W=48.0, _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 044) and further to post-StreetDesignAI (M=4.12, SD=0.91, W=18.5, _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 0028). Only StreetDesignAI


produced a significant increase in confidence translating persona needs into design decisions (baseline M=3.27, SD=1.22


→ post M=4.19, SD=0.75, W=25.5, _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 0045), compared to ChatGPT’s non-significant change (post M=3.81, SD=0.90,


_𝑝_ = 0 _._ 063). These findings suggest that while general-purpose AI tools may support initial awareness of diverse user


needs, StreetDesignAI more effectively supports the translation of those needs into actionable design decisions.


_5.3.2_ _Educational and Corrective Value._ Qualitatively, participants described capability gains as both educational (for


novices) and corrective (for experienced designers). P18 noted: “For someone specialized in transportation planning,


they can get detailed information from this interface. For planners specializing in land use or housing, this would


be even more helpful.” For novice practitioners, P13 stated: “As a beginner planner in the multimodal space, I found


the structured personas very educational. It taught me how to think about different user types.” Even experienced


professionals emphasized reduced blind spots. P15 observed: “Even as an experienced professional, I found value in the


systematic approach. It’s easy to develop blind spots, and this tool helps identify them.”


Participants explained that capability improvements also related to the system’s comprehensiveness relative to what


they would do independently. P1 contrasted: “The persona framework considers diverse cyclists more comprehensively


than I would on my own. With ChatGPT, I’d need to explicitly prompt for each perspective.” P6 described translation


from technical detail to user experience: “The tool bridges the gap between technical knowledge and user experience. It


translates engineering concepts into human impacts.”


_5.3.3_ _Parameter-Level Impact on Persona Scores._ Examining how specific design parameters influenced persona scores


revealed differential sensitivities that inform targeted interventions (Figure 8). Lane width showed progressive improve

ments across all personas, with Interested but Concerned exhibiting the steepest increase (median ≈ 6.5 for widened


lanes vs. 4.5 for narrow lanes, approximately +2.0 points). Green paint substantially benefited Interested but Concerned


cyclists (median ≈ 6.0 vs. 4.0 without paint, +2.0 points) while having minimal effect on Strong & Fearless, indicating


that visibility enhancements disproportionately serve cautious users. Physical barriers (bollards and armadillos) elevated


Interested but Concerned scores (median ≈ 7.0) compared to standard buffers (median ≈ 5.0) or no buffer (median ≈


3.0), representing approximately +2.0 points improvement. However, No Way No How remained below 4.0 regardless


of buffer type, confirming that standard protected lanes cannot serve the most risk-averse population. Buffer location


showed modest effects, with parked-car-side placement yielding slightly higher scores for Interested but Concerned,


consistent with prioritizing dooring risk mitigation.


These granular insights demonstrate how StreetDesignAI enables evidence-based parameter selection: designers


can identify which interventions serve which populations, avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions. In one Florida design


session, a participant exploring buffered lane options observed: “Adding the standard buffer improved the Interested


but Concerned score from 2 to 5—a 150% increase—while the No Way No How group stayed at 2. That tells me exactly


where to invest: this design will expand the cycling population but won’t achieve universal access. If I need to serve


everyone, I have to go with full separation.” The variation in sensitivity across personas clarifies which design elements


address which concerns: green paint enhances legitimacy and visibility (key for Interested but Concerned), physical


barriers provide psychological reassurance (essential for cautious riders), and width supports both maneuverability


(valued by Strong & Fearless) and personal space (critical for nervous cyclists).

(d) buffer location.


_5.3.4_ _Visual Feedback and Optimization Approaches._ Confidence gains were tied to concrete visual and quantitative


feedback. P12 noted: “If I needed to decide whether to put the bike lane inside or outside parked cars, I could generate


these images and see what it would look like. That visual feedback builds confidence.” P2 described an optimization

oriented approach enabled by ratings: “Now I can ensure the first three user types all score above 7, then find the


lowest cost solution that achieves that. It gives me a clear optimization target.” Participants also emphasized reassurance


about coverage of concerns. P15 stated: “the tool gave me confidence that I’m not missing major concerns. Having


systematic feedback from multiple perspectives is reassuring.” P16 connected this to stakeholder-facing justification:


“more prepared to defend my design choices now. I can anticipate objections and explain how I’ve considered different


user needs.”


_5.3.5_ _AI as Augmentation, Not Replacement._ Across interviews, participants consistently positioned capability and


confidence gains within an AI-as-augmentation relationship. P1 explained: “I see this as enhances what designers


can do rather than replacing their judgment. The interests of public safety and professional liability require human


oversight.” P16 quantified efficiency benefits: “the tool saves time on tasks that used to take hours. Instead of 3-4 hours


Manuscript submitted to ACM


StreetDesignAI 21


for an assessment, it takes 30 minutes.” P4 summarized: “This is augmentation at its best. It handles time-consuming


analysis while letting designers focus on creative problem-solving.”


Participants also emphasized the boundaries of AI and the irreplaceable role of human judgment. P16 stated: “Only a


human can really understand the specific context of a location, project, and user types. AI is one tool among many.”


P13 stressed oversight and validation: “...humans need to stay involved in the process. You can’t just let AI run on its


own. We still need to talk to residents, check design standards, and make sure everything aligns with policy.” Local


knowledge was repeatedly framed as a human advantage. P3 observed: “Road designers are always going to have a


better understanding of the local context, like traffic patterns, special events, and community needs... That kind of


knowledge isn’t something AI can really replace.”


Finally, professional responsibility and accountability further shaped how participants interpreted confidence and


capability. P1 noted: “Licensing and liability also matter a lot. Engineers are the ones who sign and seal drawings, and


that responsibility can’t be handed off to an AI system.” P25 stated: “AI can’t take responsibility. There has to be a real


person accountable for design decisions.” P23 concluded directly: “Designers must take responsibility...humans must


remain in the decision-making loop.”


**6** **DISCUSSION**


In this section, we discuss the implications of our findings for AI-assisted inclusive design, situated in past research on


human-AI collaboration and infrastructure planning. We also offer design recommendations for future systems utilizing


persona-based evaluation.


**6.1** **Conflict Surfacing as a Design Primitive for Inclusive Infrastructure**


A central finding of this work is that making experiential conflicts explicit reshapes how designers explore and reason


about alternatives. Beyond past studies focusing on general-purpose AI design assistance [23], we demonstrated that


StreetDesignAI’s multi-persona design enhances inclusive design reasoning by directly presenting designers with


preference divergences among different user groups. This design choice aligns with calls in HCI research for AI systems


that support rather than supplant human judgment [9, 27]. P1 observed that the persona system “can remind you that a


certain design might actually make some user groups feel worse, even when overall scores improve,” articulating the


value that conflict visibility prevents false consensus and prompts designers to take responsibility for their prioritization


decisions. By further examining participants’ design exploration behaviors (Section 5.1), we identified that explicitly


presenting preference divergences provides designers with a means to recognize trade-offs requiring deliberate choices


rather than technical optimization. This design promotes user agency while supporting the ideation process, drawing


from the experiential knowledge of different cyclist populations, meanwhile reducing perspective substitution and


addressing concerns about designing only for users similar to oneself.


**6.2** **Cultivating Trade-off Reasoning through Multi-Perspective Evaluation**


Our findings indicate that StreetDesignAI’s multi-perspective design not only supports perspective-taking but also trig

gers higher-order reasoning processes crucial for inclusive infrastructure design. In particular, we observed participants


repeatedly engaging in explicit prioritization activities when persona evaluations diverged. StreetDesignAI’s design


of presenting parallel persona feedback prompts participants to think about whose needs to prioritize under various


constraints, thereby stimulating trade-off reasoning.

22 Wang, et al.


For instance, by viewing divergent persona evaluations, participants reformulated their design goals in more precise


terms (e.g., shifting from “improve cycling conditions” to “expand access for cautious cyclists while maintaining


efficiency for confident riders”). Comparison instances (e.g., where participants identified that bollards improved


“Interested but Concerned” scores while “No Way No How” scores remained unchanged) were associated with explicit


decisions about which populations to invest in serving.


Additionally, the system’s comparative analysis structure and iterative parameter adjustment mechanism promoted


designer-led reflection through inference activities based on score changes across design iterations. Our findings suggest


that this conflict-surfacing interaction design contributes to designers’ inclusive infrastructure reasoning process by


promoting different levels of trade-off activities. These observations highlight the potential application of persona-based


evaluation for fostering deliberate prioritization in infrastructure design and planning education [4, 7].


**6.3** **From Understanding to Translation: Bridging the Confidence Gap**


Our quantitative results reveal an important distinction between understanding diverse user needs and confidently


translating that understanding into design decisions. While both ChatGPT and StreetDesignAI improved participants’


ability to identify persona needs, only StreetDesignAI produced significant gains in translation confidence ( _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 0045


vs. _𝑝_ = 0 _._ 063). This gap suggests that awareness of diversity is necessary but insufficient for inclusive design practice—


designers still need scaffolding to act on that awareness.


StreetDesignAI’s parameter-level feedback appears to bridge this gap by linking specific design choices to persona

specific outcomes. When P6 observed that adding bollards increased “Interested but Concerned” scores from 2 to 5


while “No Way No How” scores remained unchanged, they gained actionable insight into which interventions serve


which populations. StreetDesignAI transforms abstract understanding into targeted decision-making, helping designers


more systematically address diverse user needs.


**6.4** **Navigating Potential Biases and Limitations in Persona-Based Evaluation**


Cognitive biases have been common concerns in LLM-based user simulation systems [2]. Although our findings


demonstrated the utility of the system in providing inclusive design support, we noted potential biases when designers


interacted with persona evaluations. In StreetDesignAI, confirmation bias may arise from both designers’ persona


attention patterns and the LLM’s inherent limitations. Participants who identified as experienced cyclists tended


to engage more deeply with the “Strong & Fearless” persona feedback, potentially reinforcing their existing design


intuitions. Additionally, they trusted persona feedback more when it aligned with their professional experience,


potentially limiting exploration of unfamiliar perspectives. This aligns with prior observations that individuals prefer


assistance that aligns with their existing beliefs [16, 22].


Another potential concern we noticed was over-reliance on quantified scores. Users tended to favor numerical


safety and comfort ratings as decision anchors, even when qualitative explanations could provide richer contextual


information. Combined with the risk of equating AI-simulated feedback with genuine community input, these factors


may constrain truly inclusive design. Future systems should explicitly remind users that persona feedback complements


rather than replaces genuine public engagement, and should prominently display qualitative explanations alongside


quantified scores.

**6.5** **Design Implications for Persona-based Evaluation Systems**


_6.5.1_ _Balancing Visualization Speed with Accuracy._ Our study revealed the benefits of rapid visual generation in design


exploration (Section 5.1.1), while also identifying occasional inaccuracies in generated streetscapes. We argue that


implementing automatic quality inspection in AI-assisted design tools is essential for maintaining professional utility


while preserving exploration speed. Our findings suggest that AI-assisted design systems should recognize when


generated content requires validation to avoid misleading impressions. Future designs could introduce confidence


indicators or validation checks, helping designers distinguish between concept-level exploration and engineering-grade


visualization.


_6.5.2_ _Beyond Cycling Infrastructure: Extending Persona-Based Evaluation._ While our study focused on cycling infras

tructure, the core design principle of persona-based evaluation can be extended to other infrastructure domains, such


as pedestrian facility design, transit system planning, and accessibility assessment. During design sessions, participants


used multiple personas to examine how the same intervention affects different user groups. This approach suggests


that personas representing distinct experiential needs could benefit other domains where heterogeneous user groups


may experience the same built environment differently. For instance, pedestrian infrastructure designers could cre

ate personas representing wheelchair users, elderly pedestrians, and caregivers pushing strollers to surface diverse


accessibility needs.


Additionally, participants emphasized the importance of adapting persona feedback detail to project phase. Early

stage exploration may require broader perspective surveys, while detailed design benefits from granular parameter-level


feedback. Future systems could personalize outputs based on the designer’s indicated project stage, adjusting the


specificity of recommendations accordingly.


**6.6** **Ethical Considerations**


Given that our study involved professional practitioners evaluating their own design practices, we took several measures


to ensure ethical conduct. Participants were assured that individual performance would not be evaluated and that the


study focused on system comparison rather than designer competence. All design locations were public streets with no


proprietary information involved. Participants retained ownership of their design ideas and could withdraw at any


point without consequence. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by our institutional review board.


**7** **LIMITATION AND FUTURE WORK**


While our study demonstrates the potential of using persona-based multi-agent evaluation to support inclusive cycling


infrastructure design, several limitations should be noted.


**Persona Validation.** We did not conduct systematic validation of persona evaluation accuracy against real cyclist


assessments of the same streets. The personas’ feedback might be limited by the fine-tuning dataset’s demographic and


geographic coverage, potentially underrepresenting certain cyclist populations or regional contexts. Future research


should systematically compare persona outputs against held-out user assessments to calibrate confidence and identify


coverage gaps.


**Task Authenticity.** While participants used real street locations, study tasks were conducted in controlled conditions


without the full complexity of professional design projects involving extended timelines, budget negotiations, and


regulatory compliance. This limits our ability to assess how StreetDesignAI would integrate into actual professional


workflows. Future research should consider longitudinal deployments in real project contexts.

**Visual Generation Quality.** While participants valued rapid visualization, the GPT-Image-1-based generation


exhibited occasional inaccuracies that could affect professional utility. To avoid misleading impressions, we recognize


that automatic inspection mechanisms should be implemented to flag potentially problematic visualizations. Future


iterations should incorporate quality control validation against professional rendering standards.


**Long-term Effects.** Our study captures immediate perceptions but not whether designs produced with StreetDesig

nAI actually serve diverse populations better in practice. Future research should explore longitudinal evaluation of


infrastructure designed with persona-based tools, potentially through before-after studies of cycling adoption across


different user populations.


**Ethical Considerations.** Using AI to simulate user feedback raises questions about representation and voice. While


StreetDesignAI aims to surface perspectives that might otherwise go unheard, simulated feedback is fundamentally


different from genuine community participation. We emphasize that such tools are intended to complement—not


replace—meaningful public engagement processes.


**8** **CONCLUSION**


In conclusion, this paper presents StreetDesignAI, an interactive system that operationalizes persona-based multi-agent


evaluation for inclusive cycling infrastructure design. Our within-subjects study with 26 transportation professionals


demonstrates that StreetDesignAI significantly improves designers’ capability to accommodate diverse users and


comprehend persona requirements compared to a chatbot baseline. By presenting parallel feedback from cyclist


personas spanning confident to cautious users, the system makes experiential conflicts visible and supports deliberate


trade-off reasoning rather than false optimization. The integration of grounded street context, rapid visualization, and


iterative parameter adjustment empowers designers to explore, compare, and refine alternatives while understanding


which interventions serve which populations. Overall, we believe StreetDesignAI offers promising implications for


future infrastructure design tools that scaffold not just technical optimization, but the surfacing, navigation, and


negotiation of diverse user experiences in all their complexity.
