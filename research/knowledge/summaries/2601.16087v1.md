ABSTRACT


Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended


interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior


work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective


dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates


whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and


controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue.


We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal

Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update


rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated


over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is


injected back into generation without modifying model parameters.


Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective


dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence


enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and


hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

**1.** **Introduction**


Large language models (LLMs) are being widely used as interactive agents in applications such as


conversational interfaces, social robots, and autonomous systems that require sustained engagement [1

3]. For these agents to function effectively, they must maintain consistent personality traits and


emotional characteristics throughout prolonged interactions spanning multiple conversation turns and


sessions. However, research shows that LLM-driven agents frequently demonstrate sudden changes in


personality and emotional tone (referred to here as instantaneous affective reversal) which compromise


social consistency and diminish user confidence [4-6]. When an agent abruptly switches from showing


compassionate understanding to displaying cold indifference within the same conversation, or when it


unpredictably fluctuates between different emotional states, such inconsistency disrupts the continuity


necessary for successful human-agent interaction [7].


Prior work has attempted to mitigate these issues through various architectural modifications and


training strategies. Techniques such as persona-based prompting and role-specific conditioning help


steer model outputs toward particular character attributes [8,9], while memory mechanisms including


buffer systems and retrieval-augmented memory allow agents to reference conversational history when


formulating responses [10-12]. Additionally, instruction-based tuning and model fine-tuning help


synchronize agent behavior with target interaction styles. Nevertheless, these methods focus on


information storage rather than explicitly governing the evolution of internal states over time [3,13].


They grant agents access to historical context without constraining how emotional transitions unfold


temporally. Consequently, agents may still display abrupt emotional discontinuities despite having


extensive memory capabilities [14,15].


We contend that the core issue lies not in insufficient memory, but in the lack of inertia. Human


emotional states demonstrate temporal stability: feelings do not flip instantaneously but instead change


gradually, influenced by both immediate inputs and preceding internal conditions. This stability, known


as affective inertia in psychological and dynamical systems literature, indicates that internal states


possess momentum and resist sudden changes unless exposed to prolonged or sufficiently intense


influences. Building on this principle, we suggest representing affective state as a continuous latent


variable controlled by explicit dynamics modeled after physical systems. Instead of treating each


response as an isolated output from a stateless process, we incorporate temporal structure into the agent's


internal representation, facilitating emotional consistency across interactions.


In practice, we realize this framework using a Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) latent state


combined with second-order dynamics that account for both position (present affective state) and


velocity (pace of affective transition). Importantly, this method does not require model retraining: the


dynamics function as an inference-time overlay around the base LLM, adjusting generation through


prompt-based conditioning informed by the external state. The system operates by updating the VAD


state via a momentum-driven rule that incorporates affective signals from generated content while


honoring inertial boundaries. This architecture ensures compatibility with any pre-trained LLM and


permits flexible adjustment of inertia parameters without altering model parameters.


Our experimental results uncover systematic relationships between inertia and affective stability.


Baseline agents without hysteresis display unconstrained affective reversals, validating the fundamental


problem. Agents configured with moderate inertia show ability to gradually recover from emotional


disturbances, smoothly transitioning back to equilibrium states across multiple turns while maintaining


sensitivity to legitimate contextual shifts. Conversely, agents with overly strong inertia become locked


in particular affective states, unable to adjust when situational changes require emotional recalibration.


Notably, although token-level generation retains stochasticity, behavior becomes deterministic at the


latent representation level: identical VAD trajectory sequences yield consistent emotional patterns,


enabling reproducible and transparent agent dynamics.


These results carry significant implications for developing reliable, socially consistent agents. By


incorporating affective inertia, we introduce a coherence mechanism that augments rather than


supplants memory-oriented approaches. The resulting systems display smoother emotional transitions,


decreased vulnerability to spurious mood changes, and enhanced conformity with human expectations


regarding emotional stability. This framework holds particular value for domains such as human-robot


interaction, digital mental health interventions, and autonomous agent platforms where sustained social


engagement and emotional dependability are essential [16-18]. By anchoring affective dynamics in


explicit, adjustable physical principles, we establish a systematic approach toward creating agents that


are not merely competent, but also temporally coherent.


**2.** **Methods**


_2.1_ _Experimental Overview_


We study whether imposing explicit dynamical structure on an agent's latent affective state can induce


temporal coherence and resistance to abrupt persona shifts during multi-turn interaction. Rather than


modifying the underlying language model, we introduce an external, low-dimensional latent state


governed by physically inspired update rules and evaluate its effect on affective trajectories under


adversarial and reconciliatory dialogue.


All experiments follow a fixed, automated multi-turn dialogue protocol (detailed in S1 of


Supplementary Material) and compare four conditions: a stateless control, a first-order affective state


model, and two second-order momentum-based affective models with differing inertia. Each condition


was evaluated across five independent runs with different language model sampling seeds to assess


robustness and reproducibility.


Although instantiated here for affective state, the proposed dynamical framework is agnostic to the


semantic interpretation of the latent variable and may be applied to regulate other persistent agent-level


traits.


_2.2_ _Affective State Space_


_2.2.1_ _Latent Representation_


We represent the agent's internal affective state at dialogue turn _t_ as a continuous vector


𝒂𝒕 ∈ ℝ³


corresponding to the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensions. This latent state is not part of the


language model's hidden activations; instead, it is an explicit, external state variable maintained across


dialogue turns. This heuristic mapping is used solely to provide a noisy instantaneous affective signal;


no claims are made about psychological fidelity.


The state is initialized at a neutral baseline _**a**_ _0_ = (0, 0, 0). Although the full VAD vector is tracked, our


quantitative analysis focuses on the valence component _vt_, as it most directly reflects affective polarity


during adversarial and reconciliatory interaction [19].


_2.2.2_ _Instantaneous Affective Signal_


At each turn, the dialogue context _**x**_ _t_ (including user input and model output) is mapped to an


instantaneous affective estimate


𝒂̂ 𝑡 = f(𝒙𝑡)


where _f_ is a fixed affect extraction function and is held fixed across all conditions and runs. This


estimate is treated as memoryless and noisy, reflecting the affect implied by the current interaction


alone. Temporal coherence is not enforced at this stage.


The instantaneous affective estimate 𝑎̂𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑥𝑡) was implemented using a fixed, lexicon-based

sentiment analyzer (VADER). The compound sentiment score was used as a proxy for valence, arousal


was approximated by sentiment magnitude, and dominance by the difference between positive and


negative sentiment scores. This extraction function was held constant across all conditions and trials


and introduces no temporal smoothing or memory.


_2.3_ _Affective Dynamics_


_2.3.1_ _Stateless Control Condition_


In the stateless baseline, no affective state is maintained across turns. The affective estimate is


recomputed independently at each turn:


𝒂𝑡 = 𝒂̂ 𝑡


This defines a purely Markovian process with no path dependence or affective memory [20].


_2.3.2_ _First-Order Affective Dynamics (No Momentum)_


To isolate the effect of state persistence without inertia, we define a first-order update rule:


𝒂𝑡+1 = 𝒂𝑡 + 𝛼(𝒂̂ 𝑡                - 𝒂𝑡)


where _α_ ∈ (0, 1] controls the rate of adaptation; in this study we consider the maximally responsive


first-order regime (α = 1). This formulation corresponds to exponential smoothing [21] and introduces


affective persistence while remaining overdamped and directionally responsive. Although α = 1 yields


immediate adaptation, the first-order condition differs from the stateless baseline in that the affective


state is maintained and fed back into generation across turns.


In experiments, this condition is implemented by maintaining the affective state while setting the


momentum coefficient to zero.


_2.3.3_ _Second-Order Momentum-Based Affective Dynamics_


To model affective inertia, we extend the system to second-order dynamics by introducing an affective


velocity


𝒖𝑡 = 𝒂𝑡                  - 𝒂𝑡−1


Velocity is updated according to


𝒖𝑡+1 = 𝜇𝒖𝑡 + (1 − 𝜇)(𝒂̂ 𝑡               - 𝒂𝑡)


where _μ_ ∈ [0, 1) is an inertia (momentum) coefficient. The affective state then evolves as


𝒂𝑡+1 = 𝒂𝑡 + 𝒖𝑡+1


This formulation is analogous to discretized damped second-order systems in classical


mechanics [22] and momentum methods in optimization [23,24]. Larger values of _μ_ increase resistance


to abrupt directional change, producing path-dependent affective trajectories.


_2.3.4_ _Dynamical Regimes_


This system admits several qualitatively distinct regimes. These include a stateless regime with no


persistence or hysteresis to serve as a baseline, a first-order regime ( _μ_ = 0) having affective memory


without inertia, a second-order regime (0 < _μ_ < 1) where inertial affective dynamics are present with


hysteresis and a high-inertia regime ( _μ_ → 1) to simulate excessive persistence. These regimes are


explored empirically by varying _μ_ .


To evaluate the impact of affective memory and momentum, the study utilized four experimental


conditions: a Stateless Control (no state persistence) to establish a baseline, First-Order Dynamics ( _µ_ =


0) providing state persistence without momentum, and two second-order configurations: Moderate


Inertia ( _µ_ = 0.8) and High Inertia ( _µ_ = 0.95) to test balanced and strong momentum, respectively. Each


condition was executed across five independent runs ( _N_ = 5 per condition, 20 runs total) using a


standardized 25-turn dialogue protocol. To ensure statistical robustness and variability, each run


employed unique independent sampling seeds.


_2.4_ _Affective State Feedback into Generation_


At each dialogue turn, the current affective state 𝒂𝑡 is injected into the model’s generation context via

a structured natural-language control prompt encoding the valence, arousal, and dominance values. This


conditioning influences response tone and discourse style while leaving the underlying language model


parameters unchanged. As a result, the system forms a closed-loop interaction in which dialogue content


influences affective state evolution, which in turn modulates subsequent generation.


To verify that affective state conditioning meaningfully modulates model behavior, we conducted a


calibration in which a fixed prompt was generated under varying static VAD settings. Qualitative


differences in tone, assertiveness, and conciliatory language were observed across valence levels,


confirming that affective state injection has a measurable influence on generation.


_2.5_ _Dialogue Protocol_


All conditions are evaluated using a fixed, automated multi-turn dialogue protocol designed to induce


affective perturbation followed by reconciliation. The protocol consists of a single 25-turn philosophical


conversation that remains identical across all trials and conditions (detailed in Appendix A of the


Supplementary). No human intervention occurs during evaluation.


As described above, five independent runs were conducted per condition, each with a different language


model sampling seed, to verify robustness of the observed affective dynamics across stochastic


variations in token-level generation.


_2.6_ _Recovery Metric_


We define affective recovery as a post-perturbation event rather than a simple threshold crossing.


Let _vt_ denote the valence component of _**a**_ _t_, and let



𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 = arg min 𝑣𝑡

𝑡



be the turn at which minimum valence occurs. The recovery turn is defined as


𝑡𝑟 = min{𝑡> 𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 | 𝑣𝑡                    - 0}


If no such turn exists within the dialogue horizon, recovery is considered absent.


_2.7_ _Affective Hysteresis_


To quantify path dependence, we compute affective hysteresis as the area between the valence trajectory


during descent and recovery [25,26].


Let _v↓(t)_ denote the trajectory from the start of the dialogue to tmin, and _v↑(t)_ denote the trajectory


from tmin onward. Hysteresis is approximated via a discrete Riemann sum:


𝐻= ∑(𝑣↑(𝑡) −𝑣↓(𝑡))∆𝑡

𝑡


after interpolating the recovery trajectory onto the descent time grid. A zero-hysteresis value indicates


a memoryless affective process, while larger values indicate increasing affective inertia and path


dependence.


_2.8_ _Determinism and Reproducibility_


For a fixed dialogue trajectory, affective state evolution is fully deterministic and governed solely by


the update equations described above. Token-level text generation remains stochastic due to sampling;


repeated trials with independent sampling seeds are therefore used to assess whether macro-scale


affective dynamics are robust to stochastic variation in generated text.


_2.9_ _Language Model and Implementation Details_


All experiments are conducted using a 7B-parameter autoregressive language model quantized to 4-bit


precision [27]. Quantization is used to enable efficient experimentation and does not affect the affective


dynamics, which operate externally to the model.


For each trial, the full dialogue transcript, per-turn affective state values, and instantaneous affect


estimates are logged to disk in structured CSV format. These logs are provided in the Supplementary


Materials to enable independent inspection of affective trajectories and associated model outputs.


Since the contribution of this work concerns agent-level state dynamics rather than representational


capacity, model size and precision are not expected to qualitatively alter the observed behavior.


Affective state updates, logging, and evaluation are implemented in Python. Each trial logs per-turn


affective state values to disk for analysis.


**3.** **Results**


_3.1_ _Valence trajectories exhibit regime-dependent temporal structure_


**Figure 1: Mean valence trajectories across affective dynamical regimes.**

Mean valence 𝑣𝑡 over a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol for the stateless control, first-order affective

dynamics (𝜇= 0), and second-order momentum-based dynamics with moderate (𝜇= 0.8) and high


(𝜇= 0.95) inertia. The adversarial phase begins at turn 6 and the reconciliation phase begins at turn


14. Stateless dynamics exhibit locally reactive but temporally unstructured behavior. Stateful


dynamics introduce delayed descent following adversarial onset and recovery aligned with


reconciliation. Increasing inertia produces deeper troughs, stronger overshoot, and increased


resistance to directional change, with excessive inertia suppressing recovery within the dialogue


horizon.


Figure 1 shows the mean valence trajectories across the four affective dynamical regimes under the


fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol. The adversarial phase begins at turn 6 and the reconciliation phase


begins at turn 14.


In the stateless control condition, valence remains near zero throughout the dialogue and exhibits no


coherent descent–recovery structure. Affective responses closely track the instantaneous affective


signal, resulting in locally reactive but temporally unstructured behavior.


In contrast, all stateful conditions exhibit a delayed descent in valence following the onset of adversarial


interaction. This lag reflects the integration of instantaneous affective estimates into the maintained


affective state. The first-order model ( _μ_ = 0) produces a smooth but relatively shallow negative


excursion, followed by a gradual return toward neutral affect during reconciliation.


Second-order momentum-based models exhibit qualitatively distinct trajectories. The moderate-inertia


condition ( _μ_ = 0.8) produces a deeper negative trough and a larger positive overshoot during


reconciliation, yielding a wider affective loop. The high-inertia condition ( _μ_ = 0.95) further amplifies


this effect, producing strong resistance to directional change and extended persistence of negative affect.


Across all stateful regimes, the minimum valence occurs several turns after adversarial onset, consistent


with the expected temporal lag introduced by affective state dynamics.


_3.2_ _Recovery behavior aligns with reconciliation onset_

|Condition|Mean Recovery Turn|Recovered (N/5)|
|---|---|---|
|Stateless|∞|0/5|
|First order (_µ_=0)|14|5/5|
|Second order (_µ_=0.8)|14|5/5|
|Second order (_µ_=0.95)|∞|0/5|



**Table 1: Affective recovery across dynamical regimes.**

Mean recovery turn 𝑡𝑟 and number of trials exhibiting recovery within the 25-turn dialogue horizon

for each affective regime. Stateless dynamics and high-inertia second-order dynamics fail to recover


within the evaluation window, whereas first-order and moderate-inertia dynamics recover consistently


at the onset of reconciliation (turn 14).


We next examined affective recovery, defined as the first post-minimum turn at which valence becomes


positive. Recovery behavior is summarized in Table 1.


Neither the stateless control nor the high-inertia second-order model recovered within the 25-turn


dialogue horizon. In contrast, both the first-order and moderate-inertia ( _μ_ = 0.8) models recovered in all


trials, with recovery occurring consistently at or around turn 14.


Notably, recovery onset coincides precisely with the reconciliation phase of the dialogue protocol. This


alignment suggests that affective state dynamics do not anticipate recovery but instead mediate the


system’s response to changes in interaction tone. While inertia reshapes trajectory depth and curvature,


recovery timing remains governed by external forcing rather than internal momentum alone.


Across independent runs, recovery behavior was highly consistent, indicating that macro-scale affective


dynamics are governed primarily by the imposed update rules rather than token-level stochastic


variation.


_3.3_ _Affective hysteresis increases monotonically with inertia_


**Figure 2: Affective hysteresis increases with inertia.**


Mean hysteresis area under the curve (AUC) computed between the descent and recovery portions of


the valence trajectory for each affective regime. The stateless control exhibits zero hysteresis,


reflecting the absence of affective memory. Introducing first-order state persistence yields non-zero


hysteresis, while second-order dynamics produce progressively larger hysteresis with increasing


inertia. Error bars are omitted due to zero or negligible variation across runs.


To quantify path dependence, we computed affective hysteresis as the area between the descent and


recovery portions of the valence trajectory (Figure 2). The stateless control exhibits zero hysteresis by


construction, reflecting the absence of affective memory. Introducing first-order state persistence yields


a non-zero hysteresis area (AUC = 4.36), indicating the emergence of path-dependent affective


behavior. Second-order dynamics further amplify this effect. The moderate-inertia condition ( _μ_ = 0.8)


exhibits greater hysteresis than the first-order model (AUC = 6.85), while the high-inertia condition ( _μ_


= 0.95) produces the largest hysteresis by a substantial margin (AUC = 21.19). Hysteresis increases


monotonically with the momentum coefficient _μ_, demonstrating that affective inertia systematically


increases path dependence. These results confirm that second-order dynamics introduce qualitatively


distinct affective behavior that cannot be reproduced by first-order smoothing alone.


_3.4_ _Excessive inertia suppresses recovery within finite horizons_


While affective inertia enhances persistence and hysteresis, excessive inertia introduces a failure mode.


The high-inertia condition ( _μ_ = 0.95) fails to recover within the dialogue horizon in all trials, despite


eventual reconciliation in the dialogue.


This behavior reflects a trade-off between affective stability and responsiveness. Strong inertia confers


resistance to abrupt persona shifts but can also impede timely recovery once external conditions change.


The moderate-inertia regime balances these competing effects, maintaining persistence while


preserving recoverability.


**4.** **Discussion**


This work investigates whether imposing explicit dynamical structure on an external affective state can


induce temporally coherent and path-dependent behavior in large language model agents during multi

turn interactions. By introducing first and second-order update rules over a low-dimensional Valence

Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state, we show that affective inertia fundamentally reshapes agent-level


behavior, producing delayed responses, recovery dynamics and hysteresis that do not arise in stateless


or purely reactive systems.


_4.1_ _Affective dynamics beyond stateless activity_


Prior work in affective computing and sentiment analysis has largely focused on turn-local affect


estimation or static emotion classification [28,29]. While such approaches can characterize


instantaneous affect, they do not capture temporal structure inherent in dialogue, where emotional


responses often lag, accumulate and persist. Our results demonstrate that even a simple first-order state


update is sufficient to induce coherent affective trajectories and enable recovery following adversarial


perturbation, highlighting the importance of explicit state persistence for modeling agent behavior over


time.


The stateless control condition, which recomputes affect independently at each turn, fails to exhibit


either recovery or hysteresis, underscoring the limitations of memoryless affective processing. This


aligns with previous observations that Markovian dialogue models struggle to maintain consistent


persona or affect across extended interactions [20].


_4.2_ _Second-order inertia and path dependence_


Extending affective state updates to second-order dynamics introduces qualitatively new behavior.


Momentum-based updates, inspired by classical damped systems [22] and optimization methods


[23,24], produce affective inertia that resists abrupt directional changes and induces path dependence,


as quantified by increasing hysteresis. Importantly, this behavior emerges without modifying the


underlying language model, suggesting that agent-level dynamics can be shaped through external state


evolution alone.


The monotonic increase in hysteresis with the momentum coefficient _µ_ demonstrates that affective


inertia is a controllable property of the system. Moderate inertia produces wider affective loops while


preserving recoverability, whereas excessive inertia suppresses recovery within a finite dialogue


horizon. This trade-off mirrors stability-responsiveness tensions observed in control-systems and


optimization dynamics, where stronger damping improves smoothness at the cost of adaptability.


_4.3_ _Recovery as a dynamical, not anticipatory, phenomenon_


A key observation is that recovery onset aligns with the reconciliation phase of the dialogue protocol


across all recovering regimes. Recovery does not occur prematurely, nor is it accelerated by increased


inertia. Instead, inertia reshapes the trajectory depth and curvature while leaving recovery timing


governed by external forcing. This suggests that the imposed dynamics mediate how agents respond to


changing interaction tone rather than enabling anticipatory or predictive affective shifts. This distinction


is important for agent design; where affective inertia can stabilize behavior without decoupling the agent


from its environment. Excessive inertia, however, risks over-persistence and delayed adaptation, as


observed in the high- _µ_ regime.


_4.4_ _Implications for agent stability and design_


Recent work on agentic language models has emphasized memory, planning and tool use, often focusing


on representational or architectural modifications. Our findings suggest a complementary approach of


regulating agent behavior through explicit, low dimensional-dynamical subsystems that operate


independently of the language model’s internal representations. Such subsystems offer interpretable


control over temporal properties like persistence, lag and hysteresis, which are difficult to enforce


reliably through prompt engineering alone. Although instantiated here for affective state, the proposed


framework is agnostic to the semantic interpretation of the latent variable. Similar dynamics could be


applied to regulate other persistent agent-level traits, such as tolerance, cooperativeness or uncertain


sensitivity. This provides a general mechanism for shaping long-horizon behavior in interactive


systems.


_4.5_ _Limitations and future directions_


The study has several limitations. First, affect extraction relies on a fixed lexicon-based sentiment


estimator, which provides only a coarse proxy for affective state. While the comparative results are


robust to extractor noise, richer affect modeling could further refine trajectory shape. Second,


experiments were conducted under a single, fixed dialogue protocol. This may limit the claims about


generalization across interaction styles or domains. Finally, the evaluation horizon of the study was


finite. Longer dialogue may reveal additional dynamical regimes, including eventual recovery in high

inertia regimes.


Future work could explore adaptive or state-dependent inertia, multidimensional analysis beyond


valence and integration with learned or task-conditioned affect extractors. Extending these dynamics to


multi-agent settings or coupling them with planning and memory modules may further clarify the role


of explicit state-based evolution in stabilizing agent behavior.
