ALBINA DANILOVA AND VALENTIN LIZHDVOY


Abstract. This paper studies a Kyle-Back model with a risk-averse insider pos
sessing exponential utility and a dynamic stochastic signal about the asset’s terminal

fundamental value. While the existing literature considers either risk-neutral insid
ers with dynamic signals or risk-averse insiders with static signals, we establish equi
librium when both features are present. Our approach imposes no restrictions on

the magnitude of the risk aversion parameter, extending beyond previous work that

requires sufficiently small risk aversion. We employ a weak conditioning method
ology to construct a Schr¨odinger bridge between the insider’s signal and the asset

price process, an approach that naturally accommodates stochastic signal evolution

and removes risk aversion constraints.

We derive necessary conditions for equilibrium, showing that the optimal insider

strategy must be continuous with bounded variation. Under these conditions, we

characterize the market-maker pricing rule and insider strategy that achieve equi
librium. We obtain explicit closed-form solutions for important cases including

deterministic and quadratic signal volatilities, demonstrating the tractability of our

framework.

1. Introduction


The canonical model of markets with asymmetric information is due to Kyle (1985),

which introduced a discrete-time model of insider trading and derived its continuous
time equilibrium as a limiting case. The continuous-time framework was formalized

by Back (1992), establishing the Kyle-Back model. In this type of models there

are typically three types of agents participating in the market: non-strategic noise

traders, a strategic informed trader (insider) with private information regarding the

future fundamental value of the asset, and risk-neutral market makers competing for

the total demand. The goal of market makers is to set the pricing rule so that the

resulting price is rational. The objective of the insider is to maximize her expected

utility given the pricing rule set by the market makers. Thus, this type of modeling

can be viewed as a game with asymmetric information between the market makers

and the insider and the goal is to find an equilibrium of this game.

The majority of papers in the Kyle-Back literature consider the case when the

insider is risk-neutral (see, e.g., Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992), Back et al. (2000),

C¸etin and Danilova (2021)). By contrast, the setting of a risk-averse insider with non
linear utility has received significantly less attention despite its economic importance.

Early work on risk-averse insiders focused exclusively on models with Gaussian signals

(Baruch (2002), Cho (2003)), a significantly restrictive assumption. This limitation

was relaxed in the work of Bose and Ekren (2023), who used a fixed point approach

coupled with the Fokker-Planck equation and a quasilinear PDE to study models

with non-Gaussian insider signals and proved the existence of equilibrium for a broad

class of such signals. However, only static type of insider signal was discussed in their

work, where the insider knows the asset fundamental value from the onset of trading.

Moreover, their approach requires the risk aversion parameter to be sufficiently small

for the contraction mapping argument to succeed. Bose and Ekren (2024) extended

this framework to a multidimensional setting with multiple risky assets, again using

the fixed-point methodology with static signals and restricted risk aversion.

The cases of dynamic insider signal, when the fundamental value of the traded

asset is revealed through a stochastic process, have so far been studied only for the

risk-neutral insider (Back and Pedersen (1998), Danilova (2010), Campi et al. (2011),

Campi et al. (2013)).


RISK AVERSION OF INSIDER AND DYNAMIC ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION. 3


To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first analysis of a Kyle-Back type

model with risk-averse insider having exponential utility function and stochastic dy
namic signal about the asset fundamental value. Thus, such framework generalizes

the previous results for the static insider signal making them a particular case of our

setting. Moreover, our method imposes no restrictions on the magnitude of the risk

aversion parameter _γ_, whereas the fixed-point approach requires it to be sufficiently

small.

A key contribution of our work lies in the methodological approach and in the

technique used to prove the existence of the equilibrium. Whereas Bose and Ekren

(2023) and Bose and Ekren (2024) relied on a fixed point construction coupling the

Fokker-Planck equation with a quasilinear PDE, subject to an optimal transport

constraint at maturity, our proof is based on the weak conditioning approach. This

method constructs a Schr¨odinger bridge via weak conditioning between the stochastic

processes representing insider signal and the asset price process, closely related to

entropic optimal transport on path space. This approach naturally accommodates

the evolution of information over time, while extending the fixed-point methodology

to handle stochastic signal dynamics would require additional technical machinery.

Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, we characterize the market
maker weight function and insider trading strategy that yield the model equilibrium.

The existence of equilibrium is demonstrated by constructing a Schrodinger bridge

via weak conditioning between the stochastic processes representing the insider signal

and the asset price process. Second, we show that the optimal insider strategy must

be continuous with bounded variation and that in equilibrium there should be no

jump in the asset price and at maturity the price process converges to the signal

process. Third, we obtain explicit closed-form equilibrium solutions in particular

cases including deterministic and quadratic signal volatilities, enabling comparative

statics analysis across different levels of risk aversion.

The paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 introduces the model,

specifies the market participants and formulates the market-maker pricing rule along

with the insider’s utility optimization problem. Section 3 defines admissible pricing

rules, admissible insider strategies and model equilibrium. Section 4 presents the main

theoretical results of the work – the Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 4.2, which identify the

necessary conditions for the equilibrium and describe under what pricing rule and


4 ALBINA DANILOVA AND VALENTIN LIZHDVOY


insider strategy it can be achieved. Section 5 illustrates the theoretical results from

Section 4 with particular cases, where an equilibrium can be obtained in closed form.


2. Description of the market model


In our model we will assume that all processes are defined on the filtered probability

space
�Ω _, F, {Ft}t∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _,_ Q _[base]_ [�]


satisfying the usual conditions. Moreover, this space is assumed to be large enough

to support two independent Brownian motions _B_ and _β_ as well as a standard normal

random variable, _Z_ 0, independent of _σ_ ( _B, β_ ).

The financial market we study consists of a risk-less and a risky asset, both traded

continuously on the interval [0 _,_ 1]. The price of the risk-less asset is normalized to be

a constant, whereas the price of the risky asset is determined in the equilibrium. At

the time 1 the fundamental value of the risky asset, _V_, will be released. It is given

by _V_ = _Z_ 1 where
_Zt_ = _ηV_ ( _t_ ) (2.1)


with _η_ being the unique strong solution of


               - _t_
_ηt_ = _a_ ( _s, ηs_ ) _dβs._ (2.2)

0


In the rest of the paper we impose the following conditions on the structure of the

fundamental signal:


**Assumption 2.1.** _There exists unique strong solution to (2.2) on_ [0 _,_ 1] _with the state_
_space I_ := ( _l, u_ ) _with l, u ∈_ R [¯] _and_ 0 _∈_ _I that admits a transition density and_


(1) _a ∈_ _C_ [1] _[,]_ [2] ([0 _,_ 1] _, I_ ) _is positive, satisfies_

_at_

_[a][xx]_ (2.3)
_a_ [2] [(] _[t, x]_ [) +] 2 [(] _[t, x]_ [) =] _[ −][γ]_

_and for any t the function_    - _x_ 1
0 _a_ ( _t,y_ ) _[dy, x][ ∈]_ _[I][ has the whole]_ [ R] _[ as its range.]_
(2) _σ_ ( _s_ ) _is continuous on_ [0 _,_ 1] _and is separated from 0. Moreover, it satisfies the_

_following conditions:_

(a) _V_ ( _t_ ) := _v_ 0 + �0 _t_ _[σ]_ [2][(] _[s]_ [)] _[ds, v]_ [0] _[ ≥]_ [0] _[ satisfies][ V]_ [ (1) = 1] _[ and][ V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[ > t][ on]_ [ [0] _[,]_ [ 1)] _[,]_

(b) lim _t→_ 1 _D_ [2] ( _t_ )Λ( _t_ ) log Λ( _t_ ) = 0 _where D_ ( _t_ ) = exp     - _−_ �0 _t_ _V_ ( _s_ 1) _−s_ _[ds]_     - _and_

Λ( _t_ ) =      - _t_ 1+ _σ_ [2] ( _s_ )
0 _D_ [2] ( _s_ ) _[ds][.]_

**Remark 1.** _Note that the condition (2.3) does not necessarily require that the signal_

_must have the volatility satisfying the PDE. Indeed, as it is shown in Section 5.1 any_

_signal with deterministic volatility can be represented as a signal satisfying condition_

_(2.3). Thus, this constraint postulates that the signal can be represented in this form_

_rather than requiring that it is given in this form._


**Remark 2.** _Note that the assumption that η_ 0 = 0 _is without loss of generality. Indeed,_
_if η_ 0 _is some constant different from_ 0 _, one can shift the process ηt by the η_ 0 _and_
_modify a_ ( _t, x_ ) _to a_ ( _t, x −_ _η_ 0) _. Then the process Z will have the representation given_

_by (2.1)-(2.2)._

_Moreover, as_

               - _V_ ( _t_ )
_ηV_ ( _t_ ) = _a_ ( _s, ηs_ ) _dβs,_

0

_by employing a time change one can obtain_


_dZs_ = _σ_ ( _s_ ) _a_ ( _V_ ( _s_ ) _, Zs_ ) _dβ_ [˜] _s,_

_where_ _β_ [˜] _s is the time-changed Brownian motion defined by_ _β_ [˜] _s_ = �0 _s_ _σ_ (1 _u_ ) _[dβ][V]_ [ (] _[u]_ [)] _[.]_
_This yields_




    - _t_
_Zt_ = _Z_ 0 +



_t_  - _V_ (0)

_σ_ ( _s_ ) _a_ ( _V_ ( _s_ ) _, Zs_ ) _dβ_ [˜] _s,_ _Z_ 0 = _ηV_ (0) =
0 0



_a_ ( _t, ηt_ ) _dβt,_
0



_which can be viewed as an alternative representation of the insider signal._


There are three types of agents populating the market: noise trader, market maker

and insider. They are differentiated not only by their optimization problems, but also

by the information they have access to, hence by filtrations their actions are adapted

to. In particular:

_**Noise Traders**_ trade for reasons other than maximizing their utilities, and we

assume that their cumulative demand follows a standard Brownian motion, _B_ .

_**Market Maker**_ observes total cumulated orders, _Yt_ = _θt_ + _Bt_, where _θt_ is the
insider’s cumulated order by time _t_ . The market maker’s filtration at time _t_, _Ft_ _[M]_ [, is]
defined as _Ft_ _[M]_ := _Ft_ _[Y]_ [for] _[ t][ ∈]_ [[0] _[,]_ [ 1) and] _[ F]_ 1 _[M]_ := _F_ 1 _[Y,Z]_ .
The market maker sets the asset price, _P_, which in principle can depend on the

whole path of _Y_ . We will restrict our attention to the price processes of the form


_Pt_ = _ξt_ + _c_ for any _t ∈_ [0 _,_ 1]

where _c ∈_ R is a constant and _ξ_ satisfies the following:


_dξt_ = _w_ ( _t, ξt−_ ) _dYt_ _[c]_ [+] _[ dC][t]_ [+] _[ J][t][,]_ _ξ_ 0 = 0 _a.s.,_ (2.4)



where



_dCt_ = _[w][x]_ [(] _[t, ξ][t][−]_ [)] _w_ ( _t, ξt−_ ) ( _d_ [ _Y, Y_ ] _[c]_ _t_ _[−]_ _[dt]_ [)] _[,]_

This pricing rule was initially proposed in Cetin, Danilova (2021) as a generalization

of previous pricing rules, which does not lead to infinite insider profit. Moreover, we

can notice that if insider strategy is absolutely continuous, then this SDE will have

the form

_dξt_ = _w_ ( _t, ξt_ ) _dYt._


In above _w_ is called weighting function which satisfies admissibility conditions of

Definition (3.1). These admissibility conditions, together with the ones imposed on _θ_

in Definition (3.3) will ensure that SDE (2.4) admits a unique strong Markov solution.
Consider _P_ [0] _[,z]_  - the time 0 law of the process ( _ξ, Z_ ) starting from (0 _, z_ ). Then the

              -               market maker’s measure P, defined on Ω _, F_ 1 _[Y,Z]_, is given by


            P( _E_ ) = _P_ [0] _[,z]_ ( _E_ ) _µ_ ( _dz_ ) _,_ _∀E ∈F_ 1 _[Y,Z]_ _._


R


_**Insider**_ observes the price process _P_ and signal process _Z_ up to any time _t_, thus,
her filtration is given by _Ft_ _[I]_ [=] _[ F]_ 1 _[P,Z]_ . Insider’s objective is to maximise the expected
utility of final wealth, i.e.:


                _θ∈A_ sup( _w,c_ ) E [0] _[,z]_ _−γ_ [1] [exp]             - _−γW_ 1 _[θ]_             - [�] _,_ (2.5)


where _γ_ is given in (2.3) and _A_ ( _w, c_ ) is the set of admissible trading strategies for

pricing rule ( _w, c_ ) specified in Definition (3.3). The expectation is taken under the
measure _P_ [0] _[,z]_ defined above.
We denote by _W_ 1 _[θ]_ [an insider’s wealth at terminal time if she chooses to follow the]
trading strategy _θ_ . It is comprised of the continuous gain over the time interval [0 _,_ 1)

and gain from the possible price discrepancy at terminal time _t_ = 1, i.e.


            - 1 _−_
_W_ 1 _[θ]_ [=] _θt−dPt_ + ( _Z_ 1 _−_ _P_ 1 _−_ ) _θ_ 1 _−._

3. Admissibility and Equilibrium


The above market model suggests a feedback mechanism for the insider, as her

trading strategy will be reflected upon the asset price which in turn will influence

her trading strategy itself. In this paper, we focus on finding the equilibrium of such

market model in the following sense:


(1) given the pricing rule, insider’s trading strategy is optimal;

(2) given the trading strategy, there exists a unique strong solution for SDE (2.4)

over [0 _,_ 1) and the pricing rule is rational, i.e., martingale over [0 _,_ 1).


To formalize the definition of equilibrium and rational pricing, we need to define the

sets of admissible pricing rules and admissible trading strategies.


**Definition 3.1.** _An admissible pricing rule is a measurable weighting function w and_

_a constant c:_


(1) _w is defined on_ [0 _,_ 1] _× I, where I is given in Assumption 2.1._
(2) _w ∈C_ [1] _[,]_ [2] ([0 _,_ 1] _× I_ ) _and is positive._

(3) _The weighting function satisfies:_


_wt_

_[w][ξξ]_ [(] _[t, ξ]_ [)] = _−γ._ (3.6)
_w_ [2] [(] _[t, ξ]_ [) +] 2


(4) _There exists a unique strong solution ξ to the SDE_


_dξt_ = _w_ ( _t, ξt_ ) _dBt,_ _ξ_ 0 = 0 _a.s._


_in_ �Ω _, F,_ ( _Ft_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,_ 1) _,_ Q _[base]_ [�] _._


**Remark 3.** _It can be shown, following the methodology developed in C¸etin and_

_Danilova (2021), that in order for the equilibrium to exist the weighting function_

_w should satisfy (3.6). Thus, the condition (3) is necessary for the existence of equi-_

_librium._


**Remark 4.** _The condition (4), in essence, states that the market maker should chose_

_the weighting function such that the market price is well defined if insider refrains_

_from trading._


**Definition 3.2.** _We will call an admissible pricing rule rational if it satisfies_


_Pt_ = E                 - _Zt_ �� _FtY_                 

_for a given admissible trading strategy θ._


8 ALBINA DANILOVA AND VALENTIN LIZHDVOY


Next, we turn to the definition of insider’s admissible strategy. The minimal re
quirement for the admissibility is that the market price is well defined, i.e. SDE (2.4)

has the unique strong solution. Whereas the definition of admissible pricing rule

ensures that the market price is well defined in the absence of the insider trading,

the insider can only choose a trading strategy that results in the unique price. Thus,

the set of insider’s admissible strategies is determined by the admissible pricing rule

chosen by the market maker. The formal definition is as follows.


**Definition 3.3.** _Given an admissible pricing rule w, an admissible insider’s trading_
_strategy (denoted as θ ∈A_ ( _w_ ) _) is F_ _[ξ,Z]_ _adapted process satisfying:_


(1) _θ is a semi-martingale with summable jumps on the filtration produced by B_

_and Z._
(2) _There exists a unique strong solution of SDE (2.4) in_ �Ω _, F,_ ( _Ft_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,_ 1) _,_ Q _[base]_ [�] _._
(3) ( _ξ, Z_ ) _is a Markov process adapted to_ ( _Ft_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,_ 1) _with measure P_ [0] _[,z]_ _;_

(4) E [0] _[,z]_ [ �] exp  - _−γ_ �01 _[P][t][dB][t][ −]_ _[γ]_ 2 [2] �01 _[P]_ [ 2] _t_ _[dt]_ �� = 1 _._


**Definition 3.4.** _A pair_ (( _w, c_ ) _, θ_ ) _is an equilibrium if_ ( _w, c_ ) _is an admissible pricing_

_rule, θ is an admissible insider strategy and:_


(1) _Given θ,_ ( _w, c_ ) _is rational pricing rule (according to the Definition (3.2));_

(2) _Given_ ( _w, c_ ) _, θ maximizes the expected utility of insider final wealth (2.5)._


4. General Result


**Theorem 4.1.** _The equilibrium is given by c_ = 0 _,_


_w_ ( _t, x_ ) = _a_ ( _t, x_ )


_and_

_dθt_ = _αtdt,_ _αt_ = _w_ ( _t, ξt_ ) _[ρ][x]_ [(] _[t, ξ][t][, V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[, Z][t]_ [)]

_ρ_ ( _t, ξt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Zt_ ) _[,]_


_where ρ is the transition density of the process η, solving (2.2)_


We will prove the Theorem via a sequence of Lemmata that will establish the result.

We start with the proof that the candidate equilibrium insider’s strategy yields the

unique strong solution for the SDE governing market price process. Moreover, we

will demonstrate that this price is fully revealing at time 1.

**Lemma 4.1.** _Let ρ be the transition density of the process given by (2.2). The SDE_

_admits the unique strong solution in_ �Ω _, F,_ ( _Ft_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,_ 1) _,_ Q _[base]_ [�] _on_ [0 _,_ 1) _. Moreover, the_
_solution satisfies ξ_ 1 = _Z_ 1 Q _[base]_ _-a.s.. Furthermore,_

_Proof._ Consider the following function

_v_ ( _t, x_ ) =

_a_ ( _t, y_ ) _[dy]_ [ +] 0



_ax_ ( _s,_ 0)

_ds,_ _x ∈_ _I._

Due to the Assumption 2.1 the range of function _v_ is R. It is continuous and strictly

increasing in _x_, thus, admits a continuous increasing inverse. Denote this inverse as

_λ_ : [0 _,_ 1] _×_ R _→_ _I_, i.e.


_v_ ( _t, λ_ ( _t, y_ )) = _y_ and _λ_ ( _t, v_ ( _t, z_ )) = _z_ for any _y ∈_ R _, z ∈_ _I._


Let _κt_ = _v_ ( _t, ηt_ ) – this process does not explode on [0 _,_ 1]. Indeed, suppose _κ_
explodes and consider the sequences of stopping times _τn_ _[u]_ [= min] _[{][t][ ≥]_ [0 :] _[ κ][t]_ _[> n][}]_
and _τn_ _[l]_ [= min] _[{][t][ ≥]_ [0 :] _[ κ][t]_ _[<][ −][n][}]_ [.] Let _τ_ _[i]_ = lim _n→∞_ _τn_ _[i]_ [,] _[ i]_ [ =] _[ l, u]_ [.] Then either
Q _[base]_ [ _τ_ _[l]_ _≤_ 1] _>_ 0 or Q _[base]_ [ _τ_ _[u]_ _≤_ 1] _>_ 0. Suppose, wlog, Q _[base]_ [ _τ_ _[u]_ _≤_ 1] _>_ 0, then for
_ω ∈{τ_ _[u]_ _≤_ 1 _}_ we will have


_ητ u_ = lim _n→∞_ _[η][τ]_ _n_ _[ u]_ [= lim] _n→∞_ _[λ]_ [(] _[τ][ u]_ _n_ _[, κ][τ]_ _n_ _[ u]_ [) = lim] _n→∞_ _[λ]_ [(] _[τ][ u]_ _n_ _[, n]_ [) =] _[ λ]_ [(] _[τ][ u][,]_ [ +] _[∞]_ [) =] _[ u,]_


which contradicts the assumption that the domain of _η_ is ( _l, u_ ). Thus, we conclude
that _τ_ _[u]_ _>_ 1 a.s.. Similar arguments yield _τ_ _[l]_ _>_ 1 a.s. and therefore _κ_ does not explode

on [0 _,_ 1].

Direct application of Ito lemma yields

_dκt_ = ( _vt_ ( _t, ηt_ ) + _[a]_ [2][(] _[t, η][t]_ [)] _vxx_ ( _t, ηt_ )) _dt_ + _a_ ( _t, ηt_ ) _vx_ ( _t, ηt_ ) _dβt_

Thus, _κ_ solves SDE


_dκt_ = _dβt_ + _γλ_ ( _t, κt_ ) _dt._ (4.8)


This SDE has the unique strong solution. The existence of strong solution is obvious

as _κt_ = _v_ ( _t, ηt_ ) is a solution. As for uniqueness, suppose there is another strong
solution ˜ _κt_ . Consider a process ˜ _ηt_ = _λ_ ( _t,_ ˜ _κt_ ). Due to direct application of Ito lemma
it will satisfy (2.2), so due to the Assumption 2.1 ˜ _η ≡_ _η_ and therefore ˜ _κ_ will coincide

with _κ_ as _v_ is strictly monotone.

Next we will show that the SDE (4.8) can be viewed as a weak conditioning of a

Brownian Motion (see, e.g. Theorem 4.1 from C¸etin and Danilova (2018)) which will

allow us to characterize its transitional density.

First, we define the function

where _C_ 0 is some constant.
This function satisfies _γλ_ ( _t, x_ ) = _[u][x]_ [(] _[t,x]_ [)]

_u_ ( _t,x_ ) [, thus, we can rewrite]



_dκt_ = _dβt_ + _[u][x]_ [(] _[t, κ][t]_ [)]

_u_ ( _t, κt_ ) _[dt.]_



It is evident that _u_ ( _t, x_ ) _∈C_ [1] _[,]_ [2] ([0 _,_ 1) _,_ R) and is strictly positive in this domain.
Moreover, _u_ ( _t,_ _B_ [˜] _t_ ), where _B_ [˜] is a Brownian motion, is a true martingale. Indeed, due
to the Lemma 6.1 the fact there exists unique strong solution to (4.8) and _dκ_ ˜ _t_ = _dβt_
implies that

is a martingale.

Similarly, an application of Lemma 6.1 with the inverted roles of processes _κ_ and

_u_ ( _t,κt_ ) [is a true martingale.]
Since _u_ ( _t, x_ ) satisfies the conditions of _h_ -function in the Theorem 4.1 of C¸etin and

Danilova (2018), the (4.8) is indeed the SDE of a Brownian motion weakly conditioned

by _u_ . In particular, the transition density of the process _κ_, _p_ ( _._ ), satisfies


1
_p_ ( _s, x_ ; _t, y_ ) =
_u_ ( _s, x_ ) _[u]_ [(] _[t, y]_ [)Γ(] _[s, x, t, y]_ [)] _[,]_


where Γ is the transition density of a standard Brownian motion.

Consider the process


_Ut_ = _v_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, Zt_ ) = _v_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, ηV_ ( _t_ )) = _κV_ ( _t_ ) _._


Direct change of time yields that SDE for _U_ is:


_dUt_ = _σ_ ( _t_ ) _dβ_ [˜] _t_ + _γλ_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) _σ_ [2] ( _t_ ) _dt._


where _β_ [˜] is defined in the Remark 2.

Now we are in the position to prove that the process

_dRt_ = _dBt_ + _γλ_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _dt_ + _[p][x]_ [(] _[t, R][t][, V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[, U][t]_ [)] (4.9)

_p_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) _[dt,]_


admits a unique strong solution and _R_ 1 = _U_ 1 Q _[base]_ -a.s..
First, using the relation between _p_ ( _._ ) and the transition density of Brownian motion

we can represent



_px_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ )



_px_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) Γ _x_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ )

=
_p_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) Γ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ )



_x_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ )

Γ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) _[−]_ _[u]_ _u_ _[x]_ ( [(] _t, R_ _[t, R]_ _t_ _[t]_ ) [)]



_u_ ( _t, Rt_ )



_Ut −_ _Rt_
=
_V_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _t_ _[−]_ _[u]_ _u_ _[x]_ ( [(] _t, R_ _[t, R]_ _t_ _[t]_ ) [)] _[.]_



Thus, the equation (4.9) becomes:

_dRt_ = _dBt_ + _[U][t][ −]_ _[R][t]_

_V_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _t_ _[dt.]_


12 ALBINA DANILOVA AND VALENTIN LIZHDVOY



And therefore we have the following system of equations:


 _dUt_ = _σ_ ( _t_ ) _dβ_ [˜] _t_ + _γλ_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) _σ_ [2] ( _t_



 _dUt_ = _σ_ ( _t_ ) _dβ_ [˜] _t_ + _γλ_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) _σ_ [2] ( _t_ ) _dt,_

 _dRt_ = _dBt_ + _[U][t][−][R][t]_ _[dt.]_



_dRt_ = _dBt_ + _[U][t][−][R][t]_




_[t]_ _[t]_

_V_ ( _t_ ) _−t_ _[dt.]_



Consider a new probability measure defined by



_d_ P [˜]
_d_ Q _[base]_ ����� _F_ 1 _β,B_ ˜



= _[u]_ [(] _[v]_ [0] _[, U]_ [0][)]




[(] _[v]_ [0] _[, U]_ [0][)]

_u_ (1 _, U_ 1) [= ][(] _u_ _[v]_ (1 [0] _[, κ]_ _, κ_ _[v]_ 1 [0] ) [)]



_u_ (1 _, κ_ 1)



1
which is an equivalent to Q _[base]_ since
_u_ ( _t,κt_ ) [is a true martingale due to the above]
considerations. This change of measure yields:








 _dUt_ = _σ_ ( _t_ ) _dβt_ P˜ _[,]_

 _dRt_ = _dBt_ P˜ [+]



_dRt_ = _dBt_ P˜ [+] _V_ _[U]_ ( _[t][−]_ _t_ ) _[R]_ _−_ _[t]_




_[t]_ _[t]_

_V_ ( _t_ ) _−t_ _[dt.]_



Due to Theorem 5.2 in C¸etin and Danilova (2018) this system has the unique strong
solution and _R_ 1 = _U_ 1 P [˜] -a.s.. Since the two measures are equivalent, the equation (4.9)
has the unique strong solution and _R_ 1 = _U_ 1 Q _[base]_ -a.s., as claimed.
Now we are in position to establish the existence and uniqueness of solution of (4.7)
and the fact that _ξ_ 1 = _Z_ 1. Consider _ξ_ [˜] _t_ = _λ_ ( _t, Rt_ ) and observe that


         -         _dξ_ [˜] _t_ = _dλ_ ( _t, Rt_ ) = _λt_ ( _t, Rt_ ) + [1] _dt_ + _λx_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _dRt_

2 _[λ][xx]_ [(] _[t, R][t]_ [)]

= _−γλ_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _λx_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _dt_ + _λx_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _dBt_ + _γλ_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _λx_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _dt_

+ _λx_ ( _t, Rt_ ) _[p][x]_ [(] _[t, R][t][, V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[, U][t]_ [)]

_p_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) _[dt]_

= _w_ ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t_ ) _dBt_ + _w_ ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t_ ) _[p][x]_ [(] _[t, R][t][, V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[, U][t]_ [)]

_p_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ) _[dt]_


since
1
_λx_ ( _t, Rt_ ) = _λx_ ( _t, λ_ _[−]_ [1] ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t_ )) = = _w_ ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t_ ) _._
_vx_ ( _t, λ_ ( _t, λ_ _[−]_ [1] ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t_ ))

As _Zt_ = _λ_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, Ut_ ), _ξ_ [˜] 1 = _Z_ 1 Q _[base]_ -a.s.. Moreover, as _Ft_ _[R]_ [=] _[ F]_ _t_ _[ξ]_ [for] _[ t][ ∈]_ [[0] _[,]_ [ 1),]

_p_ ( _t, Rt, V_ ( _t_ ) _, z_ ) _dz_ = P   - _Ut ∈_ _dz_ �� _FtR_   - = P   - _Zt ∈_ _dλ_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, z_ ) _Ftξ_   - =

That is,

_ρ_ ( _t, y, V_ ( _t_ ) _, z_ ) = _[p]_ [(] _[t, λ][−]_ [1][(] _[t, y]_ [)] _[, V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[, λ][−]_ [1][(] _[V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[, z]_ [))] _._

_w_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, z_ )


Thus,


_[ξ]_ [˜] _[t][, V]_ [ (] _[t]_ [)] _[, Z][t]_ [)]
_dξ_ [˜] _t_ = _w_ ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t_ ) _dBt_ + _w_ [2] ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t_ ) _[ρ][x]_ [(] _[t,]_ _dt,_ (4.10)

_ρ_ ( _t,_ _ξ_ [˜] _t, V_ ( _t_ ) _, Zt_ )


Since the SDE for _Rt_ has the unique strong solution, _ξ_ [˜] _t_ = _λ_ ( _t, Rt_ ), and _λ_ ( _t, x_ ) is
continuous and strictly increasing in _x_, the SDE (4.10) has the unique strong solution.
Hence there exists the unique strong solution of (4.7) and _ξ_ 1 = _Z_ 1 Q _[base]_ -a.s., as
claimed.

The above two lemmata establish the result of Theorem 4.1 provided that the

strategy considered in Lemma 4.1 is admissible. Indeed, Lemma 4.2 proves that an

absolutely continuous admissible strategy such that _P_ 1 = _Z_ 1 is optimal for the insider.
On the other hand, Lemma 4.1 provides a constructive example of such a strategy.

Thus, if this strategy is admissible, the proof of Theorem 4.1 is complete.



_Proof._ of Theorem 4.1 Due to the above discussion to establish the result it remains

to show that the strategy _α_ is admissible. Verification of admissibility will follow

closely the proof of Lemma 4.1 and we will freely use the notation from it.

to _P_ [0] _[,z]_ . We know that _P_ [0] _[,z]_ is already equivalent to the measure _P_ [˜] defined in Lemma
4.1 via _u_ (0 _,_ 0)
_u_ (1 _,U_ 1) [, so it is sufficient to prove that the measure] _[ Q]_ [0] _[,z]_ [ is equivalent to the]

measure _P_ [˜] .

Following the proof of the Lemma 6.1, the required result is established once it is

shown that the two dimensional SDEs

_dRt_ = _dBt_ P˜ [+] _V_ _[U]_ ( _[t][−]_ _t_ ) _[R]_ _−_ _[t]_



have unique strong solutions.

The first SDE has the unique strong solution on [0 _,_ 1] due to Theorem 5.2 in C¸etin

and Danilova (2018). Moreover, this solution doesn’t explode on the interval [0 _,_ 1].

As to the second SDE, as its coefficients are locally Lipschitz and locally bounded,

it admits unique strong solution up to the explosion time in view of Theorem 2.8 in

C¸etin and Danilova (2018). So, it is left to prove that there is no explosion on [0 _,_ 1].
To demonstrate that, let Ω1 _⊆_ Ωbe a set of _ω ∈_ Ωsuch that: 1) solution of (4.13)
exists and continuous, and 2) there exists continuous _R_ solving (4.14) until stopping
time _τ_ ( _ω_ ). Observe that P [˜] (Ω1) = 1. Fix any _ω_ _[∗]_ _∈_ Ω1 and suppose _τ_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ ) _<_ 1. We
have that _u_ ( _t_ ) = _Rt −_ _R_ [˜] _t_ is continuous and solves


_u_ ( _t_ )
_u_ _[′]_ ( _t_ ) = _−_ _u_ (0) = 0
_V_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _t_ _[dt][ −]_ _[γλ]_ [(] _[t, u]_ [(] _[t]_ [) + ˜] _[R][t]_ [(] _[ω][∗]_ [))] _[dt,]_


on [0 _, τ_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ )) and therefore


_u_ [2] ( _t_ )
( _u_ [2] ( _t_ )) _[′]_ = _−_ (4.15)
2( _V_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _t_ ) _[dt][ −]_ _[γ]_ 2 _[u]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[λ]_ [(] _[t, u]_ [(] _[t]_ [) + ˜] _[R][t]_ [(] _[ω][∗]_ [))] _[dt]_


on [0 _, τ_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ )).

Since _λ_ ( _t, x_ ) is smooth enough, the function _n_ ( _t_ ), defined by _λ_ ( _t, n_ ( _t_ )) = 0, is
continuous, and therefore bounded on [0,1]. Thus, _n_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _R_ [˜] _t_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ ) is bounded on [0 _,_ 1]

and therefore


_−∞_ _< N∗_ = min
_t∈_ [0 _,_ 1] [(] _[n]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[R]_ [˜] _[t]_ [(] _[ω][∗]_ [))] _[ ≤]_ _t_ [max] _∈_ [0 _,_ 1] [(] _[n]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[R]_ [˜] _[t]_ [(] _[ω][∗]_ [)) =] _[ N][ ∗]_ _[<][ ∞][.]_


As _λ_ ( _t, ·_ ) is increasing, _xλ_ ( _t, x_ + _R_ [˜] _t_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ )) _>_ 0 on _x ∈_ R _\_ [ _−_ ( _N∗_ ) _[−]_ _,_ ( _N_ _[∗]_ ) [+] ], hence


min min
_t∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _,x∈_ R _[xλ]_ [(] _[t, x]_ [ + ˜] _[R][t]_ [(] _[ω][∗]_ [)) =] _t∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _,x∈_ [ _−_ ( _N∗_ ) _[−]_ _,_ ( _N_ _[∗]_ ) [+] ] _[xλ]_ [(] _[t, x]_ [ + ˜] _[R][t]_ [(] _[ω][∗]_ [)) =] _[ −][C >][ −∞]_

and it follows from (4.15) that on [0 _, τ_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ ))


_u_ [2] ( _t_ )
( _u_ [2] ( _t_ )) _[′]_ _≤−_
2( _V_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _t_ ) _[dt]_ [ +] _[ cdt]_


where _c_ = _[γC]_

2 [. Due to Gronwall’s inequality we obtain]




        - _t_ 1        - _t_
0 2( _V_ ( _u_ ) _−u_ ) _[du]_

_ds ≤_ _c_ ˜( _ω_ _[∗]_ ) for all _t ∈_ [0 _, τ_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ )) _._



_e_
0



Note that ˜ _c_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ ) is a finite constant as _V_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _t_ is bounded away from zero on _t ∈_

[0 _, τ_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ )] as _τ_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ ) _<_ 1. As ˜ _c_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ ) does not depend on _t_ and _R_ [˜] _·_ ( _ω_ _[∗]_ ) in bounded on

[0 _,_ 1] it leads to contradiction. Therefore _τ_ ( _ω_ ) _≥_ 1 for all _ω ∈_ Ω1.

Thus, we are left to establish that the solution of (4.14) does not explode at 1.

To this end consider two processes



P˜ _t_

 _dR_ _[n]_ [+] = _dB_ [+] _[U][t][−][R][n]_ [+] _[dt][ −]_ _[γλ]_ [(] _[t,][ −][n]_ [)] _[dt.]_

Observe that until _τn_ = _τn_ [+] _[∧]_ _[τ][ −]_ _n_ [, where] _[ τ]_ [ +] _n_ [= inf] _[{][t][ ≥]_ [0 :] _[ R]_ _t_ _[n]_ [+] _> n}_ and _τn_ _[−]_ [=]

_Rt_ _[n][−]_ _≤_ _Rt ≤_ _Rt_ _[n]_ [+] and therefore

we obtain the following SDEs

Due to the Theorem 5.2 in C¸etin and Danilova (2018) we conclude that _R_ [˜] 1 _[n]_ [+] =
˜
_R_ 1 _[n][−]_ = _U_ 1 and therefore _R_ 1 _[n]_ [+] = _R_ 1 _[n][−]_ = _U_ 1 (due to application of L’Hospital rule to

As P [˜] [lim _n→∞_ _τn ≥_ 1] = 1 we conclude that lim _t→_ 1 _Rt_ = _U_ 1 and in particular the
solution of SDE does not explode on [0 _,_ 1].

**Remark 5.** _For instance, one of the signals satisfying the assumption stated above_

_is the signal with constant volatility_ Σ( _t_ ) = Σ _, for which_

_This in its turn, may be true for example if_ Σ = _q and is sufficiently small, which_

This signal can be rewritten in the form

and _C_ is given by (5.16). Those satisfy the assumption (2.1), since the above assump
tion on Σ( _t_ ) gives us that _V_ ( _t_ ) _> t_ on [0 _,_ 1). Thus, it is left to check that applying

L’Hopital’s rule we get

Our theorem states that in this case the equilibrium is given by _c_ = 0,

We can notice that it is possible to represent this signal as


_dZt_ = _σ_ ( _t_ ) _a_ ( _V_ ( _t_ ) _, Zt_ ) _dβt_


where we set _βt_ = _sign_ ( _δ_ ) _β_ [ˆ] _t_ and denote

Direct calculations show that this will satisfy the Assumption 2.1. Thus, due to

Theorem 4.1 the equilibrium is given by _c_ = 0,

where _ρ_ is transition density of the process _Z_ . An explicit form of this density

function can be seen as Expression (11) in Ingersoll, ”Valuing Foreign Exchange Rate

and _a_ ( _t, x_ ) satisfies assumption (2.1).


**Remark 6.** _It can be noticed that the two different cases of such Z_ 1 _have already been_
_described in the literature:_


(1) _The case of static bounded Z_ 1 _was described in the work of Shi (2013),_
(2) _The case of static Z_ 1 _, where γ for a_ ( _t, x_ ) _is sufficiently small, has been de-_

_scribed in the work of Bose, Ekren (2023)._


In this case we can consider as a new insider signal _Z_ [˜] _t_ = _ηV_ ( _t_ ) for some _V_ ( _t_ )
satisfying Assumption 2.1 and base insider strategy on _Z_ [˜] _t_ . Thus, obtained insider

signal will satisfy the Theorem 4.1.

This shows us that there can be achieved equilibria, each for different _V_ ( _t_ ). These

equilibria according to the achieved results will only differ by the insider strategy, but

will have same weighting function and same ultimate benefit for the insider.


**Remark 7.** _Though the example of static insider signal does not formally satisfy_

_our assumptions for the main theorem due to σ_ ( _t_ ) = 0 _for this case, it is possible to_

_directly apply the same approach._

_First, let us take V_ ( _t_ ) = 1 _so it will satisfy other parts of the assumption (2.1), in_

_which terms_

_Proof._ Consider a canonical filtered space ( _C_ ([0 _,_ 1] _,_ R _[d]_ ) _,_ ( _Bt_ ) _t∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _, B_ 1) and 2 infinites
imal generators associated with the 2 systems of SDEs:

The martingale problems for ( _A_ _[X]_ _, δ_ 0) and ( _A_ _[Y]_ _, δ_ 0) are well-posed, since both re
spective SDEs have a strong unique solution (see Corollary 2.5 in C¸etin and Danilova
(2018)). Denote the solutions of those martingale problems as _P_ _[X]_ and _P_ _[Y]_ respec
tively.
In view of Theorem 3.3 in Ruf (2015), due to continuity of _µ_ and _α_ _[−]_ [1] ( _t_ )


�� 1         _P_ _[Y]_ ( _α_ _[−]_ [1] ( _s_ ) _µ_ ( _s, Xs_ )) _[T]_ _µ_ ( _s_ ) _ds < ∞_ = 1

is a martingale under _P_ _[X]_ on [0 _,_ 1].
Next, consider the original filtered probability space (Ω _, F_ _, {Ft}t∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _,_ Q _[base]_ ). As
_X_ is the strong solution of (6.18), ( _X, B_ ) _,_ (Ω _, F_ _,_ Q _[base]_ ) _, {Ft}t∈_ [0 _,_ 1] is also a weak
solution of (6.18). Thus, due to the Corollary 2.3 in C¸etin and Danilova (2018),
_P_ _[X]_ = Q _[base]_ _X_ _[−]_ [1] . Therefore _L_ is indeed a martingale on [0 _,_ 1].
