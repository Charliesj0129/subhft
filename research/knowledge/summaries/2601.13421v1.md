**Abstract**


Dealers in foreign exchange markets provide bid and ask prices to their clients at which they are happy to
buy and sell, respectively. To manage risk, dealers can skew their quotes and hedge in the interbank market.
Hedging offers certainty but comes with transaction costs and market impact. Optimal market making
with execution has previously been addressed within the Almgren-Chriss market impact model, which
includes instantaneous and permanent components. However, there is overwhelming empirical evidence
of the transient nature of market impact, with instantaneous and permanent impacts arising as the two
limiting cases. In this note, we consider an intermediate scenario and study the interplay between risk
management and impact resilience.

### **1 Introduction**


Foreign exchange (FX) markets continue to operate largely on an OTC (over-the-counter) basis where dealers
offer bid and ask prices to their clients bilaterally or via aggregators. The dealer aims to make a spread
but must manage inventory risk arising from the asynchronicity between client flow and market volatility.
To attract risk-reducing flows, the dealer can skew their quotes, but may ultimately hedge excess inventory
in the interbank market. Hedging offers certainty but comes with transaction costs and market impact.
Optimal strategies balancing spread capture and risk management have been a subject of recent active research
(Avellaneda and Stoikov, 2008; Guéant _et al._, 2013; Cartea _et al._, 2014; Butz and Oomen, 2019; Bergault and
Guéant, 2021; Barzykin _et al._, 2023, 2025). In particular, the internalization versus externalization dilemma
has been in focus (Butz and Oomen, 2019), and the Almgren-Chriss (2001) model with instantaneous cost
and linear permanent impact has been employed to describe execution in the interbank market (Barzykin
_et al._, 2023). One of the conclusions of this research is the existence of a pure internalization zone where
it is not optimal for the dealer to execute. The inventory threshold, beyond which the dealer will begin to
execute, depends on risk aversion, volatility, client flow, and, importantly, transaction costs and market impact.
There is overwhelming empirical evidence for the transient nature of market impact, with the propagator
model of Bouchaud _et al._ (2018) capturing its essence. A particular case of exponential relaxation in the
Obizhaeva-Wang model (2013) is accompanied by a clear explanation in terms of the limit order book’s
resilience. At the same time, large order execution demonstrates a universal square root dependence on
the total executed quantity (Tóth _et al._, 2011; Sato and Kanazawa, 2025). Both effects are found to be

very important in optimal execution (Neuman and Voß, 2022; Hey _et al._, 2023; Webster, 2023). So, why
Almgren-Chriss?
First of all, the square root law is a meta feature that arises for relatively large parent orders due to latent
liquidity (Bucci _et al._, 2019) and/or sophisticated traders able to take advantage of the market over-reaction
to the metaorder (Durin _et al._, 2023). For smaller sizes/participation rates, the impact is found to be linear
(Bucci _et al._, 2019; Durin _et al._, 2023). The primary route for dealers’ risk reduction is internalization, so
the linearity of hedging impact is a natural assumption, ensuring no dynamic arbitrage (Gatheral, 2010).
Secondly, the impact, albeit transient, is known to be highly persistent (Bouchaud _et al._, 2018), whereas the
typical timescale for risk relaxation for FX dealers is short (Butz and Oomen, 2019). Thus, the assumption
of permanent impact (on the timescale of risk relaxation) is also plausible. However, one can reasonably
conjecture that at least part of the impact decay should be comparable to the risk decay, as execution trades
can end up in other market makers’ inventory, and the interplay between the impact resilience and risk
management can become important.
We begin by demonstrating that OTC trading implies a propagator-type impact, as in Obizhaeva and
Wang (2013) and echoing the findings of Eisler and Bouchaud (2016) in a different market. Then we introduce
the resilient impact state into the market-making model and solve the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equation to find optimal controls both numerically and analytically within a quadratic approximation
à la Bergault _et al._ (2021). Using parameters relevant to institutional FX, we find a clear performance benefit
when risk-managing large inventories and accounting for resilient impact.

### **2 Transient Impact of Client Trades with the Dealer**


Let us demonstrate that the market-making model itself implies a transient impact, namely, as soon as
the client trades with the market maker, the price jumps and then relaxes back to its initial value. We
consider a standard Avellaneda-Stoikov (2008) OTC market-making model with Bergault-Guéant (2021)
extension to a ladder of sizes. The dealer offers bid/ask prices _St_ _[n,b/a]_ = _St ∓_ _δt_ _[n,b/a]_ for a set of trade sizes ∆ _[n]_

(0 _<_ ∆ [1] _< . . . <_ ∆ _[N]_, _N ≥_ 1) to clients. Here, the mid-price _St_ is modeled as a Brownian motion, and deltas
are dealer’s controls to optimize risk-adjusted P&L over a finite time horizon _T_ (Cartea _et al._, 2014). We
consider Poisson trade arrivals with side-symmetric intensity _λ_ _[n,b/a]_ ( _δ_ ) = _λ_ _[n]_ ( _δ_ ). This formulation is standard,
and the corresponding baseline HJB equation for the value function _V_ ( _t, q_ ) at time _t_ and inventory _q_ reads
(Guéant _et al._, 2013; Cartea _et al._, 2015; Guéant, 2016)

with _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ] and appropriate terminal condition [1] at _t_ = _T_, where _σ_ denotes volatility, _γ_ the risk aversion

_δ∈_ R


Following Bergault _et al._ (2021), we seek an approximate solution via second-order Hamiltonian expansion
and quadratic ansatz for the value function, leading to Riccati ODE. Thus, we write [2] _V_ ( _t, q_ ) = _−A_ ( _t_ ) _q_ [2] _−_ _C_ ( _t_ )
and obtain a stationary solution: [3]

Optimal quotes are, therefore,

_δ∗_ _[n,b/a]_ _≃_ _δ_ 0 _[n]_ [+] _[A]_ [0] [(∆] _[n][ ±]_ [ 2] _[q]_ [)] (7)

_c_ _[n]_

where _±_ corresponds to _b/a_, respectively. This approximate solution is well-known, even though it may
not have appeared explicitly in the early literature. It provides a valid expansion in the limit of low risk
aversion and can serve as a starting point for policy iteration – an efficient method for solving HJB numerically.


We can immediately see an instantaneous impact signature in optimal quotes. The equilibrium cost
(half-spread) for size ∆ _[n]_ is _δ_ 0 _[n]_ [+] _[ A]_ [0][∆] _[n][/c][n]_ [, but as soon as one trades, the mid-price jumps by 2] _[A]_ [0][∆] _[n][/c][n]_ [,]
ensuring no-arbitrage. [4] Under stationary control, the ODE for the mean-field inventory ¯ _qt_ = E[ _qt_ ] reads


_q_ ˙¯ _t_ =                - ∆ _[n]_ [�] _λ_ _[n]_ [�] _δ∗_ _[n,b]_ [(¯] _[q][t]_ [)]                - _−_ _λn_                - _δ∗n,a_ [(¯] _[q][t]_ [)]                - [�] _≃−ωq_ ¯ _t_ (8)

which is exponential relaxation. After an inventory shock of magnitude _q_ 0, the dealer’s position relaxes as
_q_ ¯ _t_ = _q_ 0 exp( _−ωt_ ), and so does optimal pricing. This is essentially an OTC equivalent of the Obizhaeva-Wang
(2013) model. While this is understandably an internal transient impact on a particular dealer’s pricing,
skewing is known to potentially influence the external market as well via price reading (Barzykin _et al._, 2025),
not to mention the direct market impact of the external hedging activity.

### **3 Hedging with Transient Impact**


Let us now return to the market maker’s optimization problem. In addition to skewing, the dealer can trade
in the interbank market to hedge their risk. As in Barzykin _et al._ (2023), it is assumed that hedging is
continuous with speed _vt_ and transaction cost _L_ ( _v_ ) = _ψ|v|_ + _ηv_ [2] . Hedging also causes market impact that
decays exponentially over time, as in Obizhaeva-Wang (2013). Thus, we write for the mid-price evolution


_dSt_ = _σdWt_ + _dxt,_ _dxt_ = ( _−βxt_ + _kvt_ ) _dt_ (10)


where _xt_ denotes the resilient impact state. Clearly, _β_ = 0 brings us back to Almgren-Chriss (2001). The
corresponding HJB for the value function _V_ ( _t, q, x_ ) reads (after standard substitution to eliminate price
diffusion):



0 = _∂tV −_ _βx_ ( _q_ + _∂xV_ ) _−_ [1]

with zero terminal condition and

_v∈_ R 4 _η_

_p_ E = _k_ ( _q_ + _∂xV_ ) + _∂qV_ (13)


4The weighted average price of executing two consecutive ∆ _n_ orders should equal the price of a single 2∆ _n_ order.

The terms _−βx_ ( _q_ + _∂xV_ ) come from the controlled drift in _S_ and the state drift of _x_ . The optimal quotes are
given by (using the envelope theorem)

_δ∗_ _[n,b/a]_ = ( _λ_ _[n]_ ) _[−]_ [1][ �] _−H_ OTC _[n][′]_ _Dq_ _[n]_ _±_ _[V]_ [ (] _[t, q, x]_ [)] (14)


and the optimal execution speed is

For qualitative insight let us again follow Bergault _et al._ (2021) and approximate _H_ OTC _[n]_ [(] _[p]_ [) up to the second]
order in _p_ and then use the quadratic ansatz for the value function [5]


_V_ ( _t, q, x_ ) = _−A_ ( _t_ ) _q_ [2] _−_ _B_ ( _t_ ) _qx −_ _C_ ( _t_ ) (16)


The execution Hamiltonian _H_ E( _p_ ) is neglected when approximating the value function due to the spread
cost. [6] HJB thus reduces to the Riccati system for the coefficients and the stationary solution is given by [7]


_β_
_B_ 0 = lim (17)
_T_ _→∞_ _[B]_ [(0) =] _β_ + _ω_


with _A_ 0 being the same as defined earlier in Eq. (4). _B_ 0 directly reflects the competition between impact
resilience and risk relaxation via client flow. Optimal quotes can be obtained from Eq. 14. Keeping only the
first significant correction, we obtain

with additional linear dependence on the impact state. Optimal execution speed is driven by the value of _p_ E
which is now given by
_p_ E( _q, x_ ) = _−_ �2 _A_ 0 _−_ _k_ (1 _−_ _B_ 0)� _q −_ _B_ 0 _x_ (19)


_|p_ E( _q, x_ ) _|_ = _ψ_ defines the boundary of the pure internalization zone.

### **4 Numerical Examples**


As an illustration, consider a standard size ladder of ∆ _[n]_ = (1 _,_ 2 _,_ 5 _,_ 10 _,_ 20 _,_ 50) M notional and a sigmoid
intensity function _λ_ _[n]_ ( _δ_ ) = _λ_ _[n]_ 0 �1 + exp( _an_ + _bnδ_ )� _−_ 1 with amplitudes _λn_ 0 [= (2000] _[,]_ [ 800] _[,]_ [ 600] _[,]_ [ 400] _[,]_ [ 100] _[,]_ [ 50) day] _[−]_ [1]

and uniform parameters _a_ _[n]_ = _−_ 1, _b_ _[n]_ = 7 bp _[−]_ [1] . Here, bp stands for basis points. [8] This set of parameters
corresponds to a liquid currency pair with a daily turnover of _≃_ 5 billion notional and a top-of-book spread of
_≃_ 0 _._ 5 bp. We also assume a daily volatility of 100 bp and a risk aversion coefficient of _γ_ = 10 _[−]_ [3] bp _[−]_ [1] M _[−]_ [1] .
Execution related parameters are _ψ_ = 0 _._ 2 bp, _η_ = 1 _._ 5 bp _·_ s/M, _k_ = 0 _._ 005 bp/M and _β_ = 1000 day _[−]_ [1] . The
impact decay rate was intentionally chosen to be comparable to the risk relaxation time ( _ω ≃_ 560 day _[−]_ [1] in
this case).


5Linear terms vanish due to symmetry, and the _x_ 2 term is small.
6One can neglect the spread and keep the quadratic cost as an alternative approximation, but the difference is insignificant.
7The free term does not influence the controls and thus is not shown.
8This implies GBM while we deal here with simple Brownian motion. The difference is negligible in FX market making due to
short trading horizons.

impact state _x_ for a set of parameters defined in the text. The dashed line corresponds to the approximate
solution for _x_ = 0.


Figure 1 illustrates the optimal controls _δ∗_ [1] _[,a]_ and _v∗_ as functions of the dealer’s inventory _q_ and the
impact state _x_ (colour coded). The solution was obtained by numerically solving the HJB equation using
the explicit Euler scheme (taking sub-second in JAX). The overall shape resembles the optimal solution
with Almgren-Chriss impact (Barzykin _et al._, 2023), but the dependence on the impact state is significant.
In particular, the pure internalization zone depends on the impact state, as shown in Figure 2, which is
understandable because impact relaxation is a form of price prediction. Moreover, an approximate closed-form
solution, obtained by substituting the quadratic expansion of the value function into Eqs. (14) and (15), is

found to capture the optimal solution qualitatively but deviates for larger inventories, as expected.
Figure 3 shows how P&L, position, execution speed, and impact state evolve following an inventory shock
(large client trade). The results were obtained via Monte Carlo simulations with 10 [4] trajectories using the
corresponding SDE and optimal controls (numerically exact). As expected, we can see the inventory decreasing
due to skewing and hedging, with the absolute execution speed decreasing in tandem, while the absolute
impact reaches a maximum. P&L jumps at time zero as the dealer makes a half spread, then decreases due to
impact, but then rises again due to continuing flow monetization. We compare the performance of optimal
controls with transient impact to those with permanent impact (i.e., HJB is solved with _β_ = 0), even though
the underlying impact is transient in both cases. The benefit of incorporating impact resilience is very clear in
this case. However, if large trades are rare, the majority of client flow will be internalized, so that the impact
state will rarely be sufficiently large to cause a significant difference to the total expected P&L. Therefore,
the Almgren-Chriss model can be a reasonable approximation after all. Nevertheless, risk management of
larger trades is usually under scrutiny by the desk, and this is where considering impact resilience becomes
important.
