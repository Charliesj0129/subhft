Planck-scale physics challenges the classical smooth-spacetime picture by introducing quantum
fluctuations that imply a nontrivial spacetime microstructure. We present a framework that encodes
these fluctuations by promoting local scale factors, rather than the metric tensor, to fundamental
dynamical variables while preserving general covariance. The construction employs a two-tiered hierarchy of scale manifolds, comprising a first-order manifold of scale coordinates and a second-order
manifold of fluctuation amplitude coordinates. On the first-order manifold, we formulate differential
geometry, field equations, and a canonical quantization procedure. The theory yields a geometric
renormalization-group flow for scale variables and implies spacetime discreteness at the microscopic
level. By constructing a quadratic action and performing spectral decomposition with a stabilizing
potential, we obtain discrete modal degrees of freedom quantized as harmonic oscillators. The framework proposes a microscopic description for zero-point energy of spacetime and explores implications
for vacuum energy and ultraviolet regularization, suggesting a potential dynamical mechanism that
could ameliorate the cosmological constant problem. Main results include a generalized uncertainty
relation with scale-dependent coefficients, locally scaled Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, geodesic
equations for scale spacetime, and a microscopic area operator whose state counting is consistent
with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This work develops a scale-based quantization procedure,
providing a foundation for further mathematical analysis and phenomenological tests of spacetime
quantization.



**I.** **INTRODUCTION**


The reconciliation of quantum mechanics with general
relativity remains one of the most profound challenges
in fundamental physics. At the Planck scale, where the
characteristic length is approximately _lp ∼_ 10 _[−]_ [35] meters, classical concepts of spacetime geometry break down
due to intrinsic quantum fluctuations. These fluctuations
render the smooth manifold picture of spacetime inadequate, necessitating a reformulation of geometry and
measurement consistent with quantum principles.


Various leading approaches to quantum gravity offer distinct perspectives on the microscopic structure of
spacetime. Loop quantum gravity posits that space is
fundamentally discrete, with areas and volumes arising
from networks of quantized spin states [1–5]. String theory instead describes all particles and interactions as different vibrational modes of one-dimensional strings propagating in a higher-dimensional background [6–10]. The
asymptotic safety program conjectures that the gravitational coupling approaches a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed
point under renormalization, ensuring predictivity at all
scales [11, 12]. Noncommutative geometry replaces classical coordinates with noncommuting operators, encoding geometry algebraically and potentially smoothing out

shortdistance singularities [13]. Finally, causal set theory models spacetime as a discrete, partially ordered set
of events, where the causal relations themselves constitute the fundamental structure [14, 15]. Recent research
in quantum gravity reveals various new approaches and
theories [16–30]. Although these studies have greatly improved our understanding of physics at the Planck scale,
an unified framework that connects geometric fluctuations to observable phenomena remains elusive.
Hoˇrava-Lifshitz gravity [31] introduces an anisotropic
scaling between space and time, characterized by a dynamical critical exponent _z >_ 1, which renders the theory
powercounting renormalizable in the ultraviolet regime
while recovering general relativity in the infrared limit.
By breaking full diffeomorphism invariance down to the
subgroup preserving a preferred foliation of spacetime,
the model allows higher-order spatial derivative terms
(up to 2 _z_ derivatives) without introducing ghost instabilities, thereby improving the UV behavior of the graviton
propagator. Subsequent studies have explored its cosmological implications, demonstrating that the modified
dispersion relations can lead to novel early-universe dynamics and potential observational signatures in the cosmic microwave background and gravitational-wave spectra [32]. Despite its appealing features, Hoˇrava-Lifshitz
gravity involves certain subtleties. The reduced diffeomorphism symmetry leads to an additional scalar graviton mode, whose role in low-energy dynamics has been
widely explored [33, 34]. The restoration of Lorentz invariance in the infrared typically involves specific mechanisms, and various approaches have been proposed to


address strong coupling and define a consistent Hamiltonian structure [35, 36]. These aspects continue to guide
the development and refinement of the theory.

Recent advances in observational cosmology and
gravitational-wave astronomy have begun to place stringent bounds on possible deviations from classical general
relativity at Planckian scales. In particular, the analysis of the first direct detection of gravitational waves by
LIGO and Virgo (GW150914) has been used to test the
propagation speed, dispersion relations, and polarization
content of gravitational radiation, finding agreement with
Einstein’s theory to within parts in 10 _[−]_ [15] [37]. Complementarily, measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the Planck satellite have constrained the spectrum of primordial perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, thereby limiting the parameter space of inflationary
models that incorporate quantum-gravity-induced corrections to the primordial power spectrum [38]. Together,
these empirical results impose critical benchmarks for
any theory of quantum gravity that predicts modifications to spacetime dynamics or fundamental dispersion
relations.

The study of physics at the Planck scale has garnered
significant attention due to its implications for understanding the fundamental nature of the universe. At
the heart of this challenge lies the incompatibility between the smooth, deterministic spacetime geometry of
general relativity and the inherently probabilistic, fluctuating nature of quantum systems at microscopic scales.
At the Planck scale, quantum fluctuations challenge the
classical concept of spacetime as a smooth continuum, revealing a complex microstructure that defies traditional
models. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle [39] implies that spacetime coordinates themselves become uncertain at this scale, resulting in fluctuations in microscopic lengths. This fundamental uncertainty renders
traditional geometric concepts inadequate for an accurate
description. Our prior article [40] laid the foundation by
introducing a scale-based spacetime framework, in which
local scaling functions were incorporated into key physical equations, including the geodesic, Einstein, KleinGordon, and Dirac equations, to reflect the effects of
microscopic spacetime fluctuations. While that work focused primarily on reformulating classical geometric and
field-theoretic structures in a scale-sensitive manner, the
present study represents a significant extension by formulating a two-tiered scale geometry (via scale fluctuating
factors _aµ_ and _bµ_ ), introducing canonical quantization of
spacetime fluctuations, and constructing scale geometry
dynamics on these quantum scale manifolds. This allows
us to construct a framework for the quantization and
renormalization of fluctuating spacetime itself. The current research advances our understanding of Planck-scale
physics by extending the scale-based theoretical framework proposed in prior work, while introducing novel
quantization for characterizing quantum spacetime microstructure.

Building on the general quantum-gravity landscape

outlined above, this work introduces several key innovations. First, we define local anisotropic scaling measurements _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) and their associated scale fluctuating factors _aα_ and _bα_ . Second, these scale factors naturally give rise to two successive scale manifolds—a firstorder scale manifold ( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _g_ ) with coordinates _X_ _[α]_ and
a second-order amplitude manifold ( _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] _,_ ˜ _g_ ) with coordinates _aα_ —each endowed with its own Levi-Civita connection and geodesic equations governing the evolution
of scaling spacetime. Third, by formulating EinsteinHilbert actions and performing a canonical quantization
of the fluctuation factors, this framework aims to understand how intrinsic quantum fluctuations reshape the
local spacetime geometry.
The paper is organized as follows. **Section II** introduces the operational principle of measuring infinitesimal intervals against fixed reference lengths and develops the dual-measurement picture that implies a discrete microscopic spacetime. In **Section III**, we define fluctuation-dependent differential operators, derive
the deformed commutator algebra and its generalized
uncertainty relations, and present locally scaled KleinGordon and Dirac equations. **Section IV** establishes
Lorentz and general covariance in the scaling geometry
and embeds the scale fluctuating factors _aµ_ into a vierbein formulation. **Section V** derives variational firstand second-order geodesic equations on the scale and
amplitude manifolds. In **Section VI**, we construct a
scaling Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian and perform canonical quantization of the first-order fluctuating factors _aµ_,
quantized to ˆ _aα_ . **Section VII** defines a micro-area operator and applies it to black-hole entropy counting. Finally, **Section VIII** discusses implications, limitations,
and directions for further work, and **Section IX** concludes.
Because the defined scale fluctuating factors _aα_ transform differently from ordinary tensor components (see
Section IV), we adopt a careful, context-dependent convention for Einstein summation throughout the paper;
the precise rules and illustrative examples are collected
right after defining the scale factor _aα_ in Section II.


**II.** **MICRO-MEASUREMENT**


**A.** **The principle of Micro-measurement**


As the micro measurement principle stated in [40], at
the microscopic scale, measuring the distance between
two infinitesimally close spacetime points, denoted by _dx_,
requires comparison with a fixed reference length. If _dx_ is
stable, its measurement depends solely on the reference.
However, if _dx_ fluctuates – due to quantum effects as
suggested by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle – its
measurement relative to the reference becomes a scaledependent function, i.e., scaling function _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ). In
quantum gravity, such linear and nonlinear fluctuations
reflect spacetime’s dynamic nature at small scales. De

scribing spacetime microelements through scaling functions provides a framework for probing their microstructure and developing new mathematical tools to study it.
In quantum gravity regimes, the fluctuations undermine the applicability of classical smooth geometry and
introduce intrinsic uncertainties in position measurements. To model this behavior, we consider differential
microelements _dx_ _[α]_ relative to reference lengths _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [as]
micromeasurement, where _α_ denotes orthonormal frame
coordinates. At the Planck scale, quantum fluctuations
of spacetime cause measurements of position and distance
to be indescribable by classical geometry, and we introduce a dynamic scale function _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) to quantify this
uncertainty.
The micro measurements of the fluctuating spacetime
are quantified through scaling functions:


_rlα_ = _[dx][α]_ = _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ( _τ_ )) (1)

_dx_ _[α]_ 0


where _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ( _τ_ )) describe deviations from reference
measurements _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [, denoted by spacetime scales] _[ X]_ _[α]_ [. The]
latter can be regarded as a scale of freedom for measuring
the microscopic length of a local region. These functions
capture quantum fluctuations in spacetime at the Planck
scale. The micro variations of _dx_ _[α]_, i.e., _d_ ( _dx_ _[α]_ ) _∼_ _dL_ _[α]_,
are defined as the fluctuations, providing a way to model
the geometry of spacetime as it fluctuates due to quantum effects. For properlength measurements, we introduce the relation


_rl_ = _[dλ]_ = _τ_ ( _X_ ( _s_ )) (2)

_dλ_ 0


where _dλ_ denotes the infinitesimal physical proper-length
element along a worldline in the fluctuating spacetime,
and _dλ_ 0 is the corresponding reference proper length.
The function _τ_ ( _X_ ) is a scalar scaling function that characterizes how microscopic spacetime fluctuations modify
proper-length measurements. It plays a role analogous to
the directional scaling functions _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ), but is applied
to the Lorentz-invariant proper scale. In this expression,
_X_ = _X_ ( _s_ ) indicates that the proper scale is evaluated
along the worldline parameterized by the proper-time
scale _s_ . The parameter _s_ is the affine parameter associated with a timelike worldline. The relative measurement
becomes:



_dx_ _[α]_



_dx_ _[α]_ _[L][α]_ [(] _[X]_ _[α]_ [(] _[τ]_ [))]

_dλ_ [=] _τ_ ( _X_ ( _s_ ))

_τ_ ( _X_ ( _s_ ))

( _τ_ = constant), representing fluctuation-free measurements that reduce to _L_ _[α]_ = 1 (static finite interval) under single-axis normalization, and _L_ _[α]_ = 0 (trivial measurement) define a continuous spacetime, defining any
small interval; (2) _Linear fluctuation mode_ governed by
_L_ _[α]_ = _K_ 1 _[α][X]_ _[α]_ [ +] _[ K]_ 2 _[α]_ [(] _[τ]_ [ =] _[ K]_ [1] _[X]_ [ +] _[ K]_ [2][), where micro-]
lengths measuring linearly with scales, simplifiable to
_L_ _[α]_ = _X_ _[α]_ through reference transformations; (3) _Non-_
_linear regime_ characterized by general functional dependencies _L_ _[α]_ = _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) ( _τ_ = _τ_ ( _X_ )), accommodating complex or discrete spacetime variations. Isotropy emerges
when identical scaling functions _L_ _[α]_ operate across all dimensions. The scaling function with non-trivial (except
_L_ _[α]_ = 0) measurement is applied to describe the spacetime fluctuation measurement.
To analyze infinitesimal changes in these scale factors
under rescaling, define


_dx_ ¯ _[α]_ = _L_ [¯] _[α]_ _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [=] _[ L][α]_ [(] _[ζ]_ _[α][X]_ _[α]_ [)] _[dx]_ 0 _[α]_ [=] _[ L][α]_ [( ¯] _[X]_ _[α]_ [)] _[dx]_ 0 _[α]_ (4)


with _X_ ¯ _[α]_ = _ζ_ _[α]_ _X_ _[α]_ and _ζ_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) being the _α −_ _axis_
rescale factor of scale transformation. From _d_ ( _dx_ _[α]_ ) =
_dx_ ¯ _[α]_ _−_ _dx_ _[α]_ = ( _dx_ _[d][x]_ [¯] _[α][α]_ _[−]_ [1)] _[dx][α]_ [ = (] _LL_ ¯ _[α][α]_ _[−]_ [1)] _[dx][α]_ [ and] _[ d]_ [(] _[dx][α]_ [) =]

_dL_ _[α]_
_dX_ _[α]_ _[dX]_ _[α][dx][α]_ 0 [, we get]


_dX_ _[α]_ 1

_dx_ _[α]_ [=] _[ a][α]_ _dx_ _[α]_ 0 (5)


with


_L_ ¯ _[α]_ _/L_ _[α]_ _−_ 1
_aα_ = _dL_ _[α]_ _/dX_ _[α]_ _[.]_ (6)


Eq. (5) can also be expressed as


_dX_ _[α]_ = _aαL_ _[α]_ _,_ (7)


_aα_ = _aα_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) are induced by the micro variation _d_ ( _dx_ _[α]_ ),
quantifying the amplitude of fluctuations in the _α_ direction, defined as first-order fluctuating factors. It
describes how the magnitude of fluctuations in different modes or directions “breathes”. Note, _aα_ are prequantized scale factors before it is promoted to be the
quantized operators through the quantization procedure
described in section VI.
Since the introduced scale fluctuating factors _aµ_ are
direction-dependent, dimensionless Lorentz-scalar, each
component encodes the fluctuation amplitude along its
respective direction. The covariant properties of these
factors are discussed in detail in Section IV. Because of
this, throughout this paper, we adopt the convention as
listed in TABLE I for using the Einstein summation.
The most general Lorentz-scalar line element can be
written as


_dλ_ [2] = _gαβ dx_ _[α]_ _dx_ _[β]_ _,_ (8)


where _gαβ_ denotes the metric tensor. The invariant interval provides a natural probe of possible spacetime fluctuations at short distances. As introduced in [40], using the



with gauging _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [=] _[ dλ]_ [0][. A natural candidate for the ref-]
erence scale _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [is the Planck length in quantum grav-]
ity regimes, which we adopt in what follows. Notably,
these reference differentials _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [(] _[dλ]_ [0][) remain constant in]
differentiation processes, representing dimensional constants rather than dynamic variables.
Based on the above definitions, the spacetime microstructure measurements manifest through three distinct types: (1) _Static mode_ with _L_ _[α]_ = constant

scaling representation introduced above, we obtain an expression for the metric in terms of micro-measurements
of spacetime fluctuations:

For a static measurement, when _τ_ = _τC_ and _L_ _[α]_ = _L_ _[α]_ _C_
(constants), we define

element. For a general (non-static) measurement, one
therefore has


_τ_ [2] = _gαβL_ _[α]_ _L_ _[β]_ _,_ (11)


again adopting the same consistent choice _dλ_ 0 = _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [=]
_dx_ _[β]_ 0 [. With considering Eq. (][7][), one finds]


_dX_ [2] = ˆ _gαβdX_ _[α]_ _dX_ _[β]_ _,_ (12)



defining a scale-measuring spacetime, where _gαβ_ =
Ω [(] _αβ_ _[a]_ [)] _[g]_ [ˆ] _[αβ]_ [ with Ω] _αβ_ [(] _[a]_ [)] [=] _aαaa_ [2] _β_ [.] The definition of _a_ from



Ω _αβ_ _[g]_ [ˆ] _[αβ]_ [ with Ω] _αβ_ [=] _αa_ [2] _β_ [.] The definition of _a_ from

proper length (i.e, Lorentz invariant line element _τ_ ) is
similar to _aα_ [40]. Defining an inverse metric ˆ _g_ _[αβ]_ =
_g_ _[αβ ][a][α][a]_ [2] _[β]_ to satisfy ˆ _g_ _[αβ]_ _g_ ˆ _βγ_ = _δ_ _[α]_ _aα_ [when] _[ g][αβ][g][βγ]_ [ =] _[ δ][α]_ [.]

In this framework, the microscopic fluctuations of the
physical metric _gαβ_ are captured by promoting local,
direction-dependent scale factors _aµ_ to fundamental dynamical variables. Physically, these factors represent
anisotropic deformations acting upon the metric ˆ _gαβ_ . In
this picture, _gαβ_ remains the fundamental field governing



classical gravity, while its quantum behavior and Planckscale structure are effectively described by the dynamics
of the scaling sector (ˆ _gαβ, aα_ ). This approach provides
an alternative to direct metric quantization by focusing
on the degrees of freedom most sensitive to quantum geometric fluctuations. More concretely, the physical metric can be expressed as the result of anisotropic stretching or compression of the elastic substrate metric ˆ _gαβ_,
modulated by scale factors Ω [(] _αβ_ _[a]_ [)][. The term “substrate”]
reflects the dual role of ˆ _gαβ_ : it serves as the geometric substrate on which _gαβ_ is constructed via anisotropic
scaling, and simultaneously as the dynamical substrate
defining the manifold _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] on which the scale factors
_aµ_ fluctuate. This composite structure cleanly separates
the smooth classical geometry (described by ˆ _g_ ) from its
microscopic fluctuations (encoded in _aµ_ ). Together, _gαβ_
and ˆ _gαβ_ form an anisotropic structure, where each _aα_
governs local scaling behavior along a coordinate direction. If _aα_ is constant and isotropic, the framework reduces to a global conformal transformation; otherwise,
it captures directionally varying and position-dependent
fluctuations.
In this context, the manifold ( _M, gαβ, x_ _[α]_ ) no longer
represents a fixed classical geometry. Instead, it is dynamically shaped by microscopic fluctuation effects and
the measurement prescription embodied in the scale factors _aα_ . This perspective is operationally extended
to a measurement-sensitive space ( _M, gαβ, L_ _[α]_ ), where
the scale variables _L_ _[α]_ incorporate both classical smooth
contributions and quantum fluctuating components to
length measurements. At a deeper level, the geometry
( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _gαβ, X_ _[α]_ ) provides a refined substrate structure
that naturally couples to quantum fluctuations. This
scaling spacetime encodes first-order local deformations


and reflects quantum effects in a directional and localized manner. This geometric construction is motivated by the recognition that quantum-scale measurement processes—especially those sensitive to spacetime
fluctuations—cannot be fully described by smooth classical metrics alone. Instead, fluctuation-responsive geometries built from locally rescaled structures offer a more
accurate and physically intuitive framework, bridging microscopic quantum dynamics with spacetime geometry.
Define second-order fluctuation factors

measurable structure. Specifically, metric _gαβ_ results
from two successive anisotropic scale transformations
governed by the fluctuation factors _aα_ and _bα_, which respectively characterize first- and second-order scale deformations. This hierarchical perspective differs from
the conventional viewpoint: the classical-physical metric _gαβ_ is instead fluctuation-informed and measurementdependent, bridging scale fluctuation geometry with observable structure in a physically meaningful way.
Then, the first and second-order partial differential operators transformed in scaling form can be introduced by

are first-order fluctuation factors. _bα_ are second-order
fluctuation factors, appearing in the term of the secondorder differential fluctuating factors; they reflect the nonuniformity of scale deformation.
Metrics ˆ _g_ and ˜ _g_ correspond to different hierarchical levels induced by spacetime fluctuations on microscale. The
first-order fluctuation geometry ( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _gαβ, X_ _[α]_ ) captures the local anisotropic scaling structure generated
by the microscopic scaling _aα_, encoding directional fluctuations in length measurements. Building upon this,
the second-order fluctuation geometry ( _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] _,_ ˜ _gαβ, aα_ )
characterizes the variation or “inhomogeneity” of _aα_ itself, as quantified by the second-order scale factors _bα_ .
This additional layer of structure reflects more refined,
derivative-level deformation effects in the micro spacetime geometry.
To reflect this, we introduce a hierarchical structure of
metrics:


_g_ ˜ _αβ_ _−→bα_ _g_ ˆ _αβ_ _−−→aα_ _gαβ_ = _⇒_ _gαβ_ = ˜ _gαβ ×_ Ω [(] _[b]_ [)] _×_ Ω [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_


where: - ˜ _gαβ_ captures second-order fluctuation structures, including variation in the fluctuation amplitude
itself; - ˆ _gαβ_ reflects first-order anisotropic scaling effects
associated with _aα_ ; - _gαβ_ is the resulting physical geometry that combines both levels of fluctuation into a



(17)
The connection between differential operators and scaling functions emerges by introducing a rescale factor _ζ_ _[ν]_,
which also defines spacetime microelement fluctuations.
This incorporates transformation factors _aν_ and _bν_ that
modify differential operator behavior under scale transformations. Mapping classical differential operators into
the _X_ _[ν]_ scaling coordinate system via the appropriate
scaling functions provides a systematic connection for
probing the microscopic (Planck-scale) spacetime structure in an explicitly scale-aware manner.
Using the scale transformation _X_ [¯] _[α]_ = _ζ_ _[α]_ _X_ _[α]_ with the

( _M_ [(] _[ξ]_ [)] _,_ ¯ _g,_ _X_ [¯] _[α]_ ). Here, the metric incorporates the influence of microscopic fluctuations into the geometry itself,
allowing all physical fields to evolve under the combined
effects of the elastic substrate structure and the embedded fluctuation scale factors, while preserving general covariance. With linear mapping, the rescale factors are
governed by


_aα_ = 1 _/ξ_ _[α]_ _,_ Ω _[ξ]_ _αβ_ [Ω] _αβ_ _[a]_ [= 1] _[.]_ (23)


As a result, consistent mapping relations between the
nonlinear and linear representations of length are established. Therefore, the first-order fluctuation mapping is
given by

_g_ ¯ _[αβ]_ _g_ ¯ _βγ_ = _δγ_ _[α]_ _aaαγ_ _ξξ_ _[α][γ]_ [.]



_g_ ¯ _g_ ¯ _βγ_ = _δγ_ _aαγ_ _ξ_ _[γ]_ [.]

A linear mapping is introduced between the physical
coordinates _x_ _[α]_ and a set of rescaled variables _X_ [¯] _[α]_, defined as _X_ [¯] _[α]_ = _ζ_ _[α]_ _X_ _[α]_, where _ζ_ _[α]_ denotes the rescale factor in each direction. This transformation provides a
linearized representation of the original nonlinearly measured spacetime structure, enabling a linearized analysis of microscopic fluctuations. The corresponding linear
mapping differential relation,


_dx_ _[α]_ = _dX_ [¯] _[α]_ _dx_ _[α]_ 0 _[,]_ (22)


suggests that the local displacement _dx_ _[α]_ can be viewed
as a product of the scaled increment _dX_ [¯] _[α]_ and a reference length scale _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [. The nonlinear measurement kernel]
_L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) can be effectively mapped onto a linear structure
governed by _X_ [¯] _[α]_ .
This linearization aims to simplify the mathematical
structure while capturing the essential physical content
of the fluctuations. It establishes a dual description in
which the complex fluctuation behavior encoded in _L_ _[α]_

can be equivalently analyzed through the evolution of
the linearly scaled quantities _dX_ [¯] _[α]_ . As a result, the system’s intrinsic dynamical properties can be extracted.
This leads to a self-consistent measurement framework in
which nonlinear fluctuation behavior is embedded within
the evolution of linearly scaled quantities, allowing one
to describe complex quantum-scale variations using geometrically intuitive linear dynamics. In this construction,
the scaled differential _dX_ [¯] _[α]_ serves as an effective measure
of microscopic length, equivalent in fluctuation content
to the nonlinear measure _L_ _[α]_, thereby enabling a dual
description of quantum-scale measurements.
The distinction between nonlinear and linear measurements of micro-length _L_ _[µ]_ under different scaling coordinates admits an analogy with general relativity: just as
the metric in a general coordinate frame can be locally
transformed into its Minkowski form in a freely falling
frame, the nonlinear fluctuation kernel _L_ _[µ]_ ( _X_ _[µ]_ ) can be
mapped onto a linearized structure described by _dX_ [¯] _[µ]_ .
Nonlinear _L_ _[µ]_ ( _X_ _[µ]_ ) is analogous to the length measurements in a general coordinate frame, while linear _dX_ [¯] _[µ]_ is
analogous to the measurement in a locally inertial frame.
This mapping to a fluctuation-local inertial frame simplifies the analysis of quantum spacetime fluctuations,
thereby clarifying the physical motivation for introducing the scaled variables _X_ [¯] _[µ]_ in the context of fluctuationsensitive geometry.
The associated metric ¯ _gαβ_ = _gαβ_ ( _x_ _[µ]_ _→_ _X_ [¯] _[µ]_ ) encodes
fluctuation effects within a rescaled coordinate space



and we have _L_ [¯] _[α]_ = 2 _L_ _[α]_, namely

while the second-order mapping for the fluctuation factors _bα_ read


1 _dξ_ _[α]_
_bα_ = ( _ξ_ _[α]_ ) [2] _dX_ _[α]_ _[.]_ (25)



These relations provide a bridge between differential operators in the nonlinear and linearized geometries.
Moreover, this construction reveals a dual measurement principle: microscopic length measurements can be
equivalently described by either the fluctuation-sensitive
quantity _L_ _[µ]_ or the differential _dX_ [¯] _[µ]_, both residing in the
rescaled fluctuation spacetime ( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _g, X_ _[α]_ ). The fluctuation factor _aµ_ thus admits an alternative representation via the inverse scale factor 1 _/ξ_ _[µ]_, establishing a oneto-one correspondence between nonlinear and linearized
descriptions of quantum geometric fluctuations. This duality forms a consistent measurement theory that allows
for the analysis of complex fluctuation dynamics.

sponds to a linear case. In the latter situation, with
_ζ−_ _[α]_ [= 0, the micromeasurement reduces to] _[ L][ ≡]_ [0, de-]
scribing an absolutely static and continuous spacetime in
which ultraviolet divergences arise. For all other configurations, the spacetime becomes fluctuating and discrete,
providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff. In this context, the
behavior of _L_ _[α]_ is analogous to an order parameter, marking a phase transition between a static, classical continuum _L_ _[α]_ _≡_ 0 and a dynamic, fluctuating regime with
discrete characteristics _L_ _[α]_ = _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ).
As depicted in Fig. 2 of the schematic diagram of microscopic spacetime measurements when _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_ _[<]_ [ 0 and]
_X_ _[α]_ _>_ 0, the spacetime microstructure is discrete and
equidistant ( _L_ [¯] _[α]_ = 2 _L_ _[α]_ ), bounded by _X_ [¯] 0 _[α][/]_ [2] _[ < L][−]_ _[≤]_ _[X]_ [¯] 0 _[α]_
and _L_ + _≥_ _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_ [. The scaling function] _[ L][α]_ [(] _[X]_ _[α]_ [), with ¯] _[X]_ 0 _[α]_
as the modulating parameter, governs the microscopic
length measurement. When _ζ_ _[α]_ takes its negative solution branch and _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_ _[→]_ [0, the system approaches the]
smooth classical continuum. The existence of dual solutions for the rescaling factor _ζ_ _[α]_ highlights a fundamental
duality in the nature of the fluctuating spacetime. By
incorporating (i) the Heisenberg uncertainty principle at
the Planck scale and (ii) intrinsic spacetime fluctuations,
the framework predicts a natural, built-in ultraviolet cutoff, where _L_ _[α]_ _̸≡_ 0.
In theoretical physics, particularly in quantum field
theory, the renormalization group (RG) [41, 42] provides
a systematic framework for analyzing how a physical system behaves under changes in the scale of observation.
This general approach applies to any system that exhibits
scaling behavior, including those in quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and other fields where physical
quantities depend on scale. The RG flow describes how

_−daα_ = _−∞_ at _X_ _[α]_ _→∞_ .
D: For _X_ _[α]_ _→_ + _∞_ with _X_ ¯0 _[α]_ _<_ 0, point D represents an SIR fixed point analogous to C, whose specific limiting behavior is cataloged in TABLE II. Since
_dL_ _[α]_ _/dX_ _[α]_ = _ξ_ _[α]_ = 1 _/aα_ = 0 and _L_ _[α]_ = _L_ _[α]_ _∗_ [=] _[ −][X]_ [¯] 0 _[α][/]_ [2, the]

SUV fixed point with a positive slope. When _ζ_ _[α]_ = 0,
_β_ = 0 across all _X_ _[α]_, corresponding to unstable fixed
points (saddle point) with zero slope ( _dβ/dL_ = 0). For

and _aαbα_ = 0 universally. When _X_ _[α]_ _→_ 0, _L_ _[α]_ = 0,
_dX_ _[α]_ = 0, _−daα_ = 0. For _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_ [= 0 and] _[ ζ]_ _[α]_ [ = 0,] _[ L][α]_ [ =]
0, _aα_ = _∞_, _bα_ = 0. This corresponds to an unstable
structure, where _dX_ _[α]_ = _∞∗_ 0, _−daα_ = 0 _∗∞∗_ 0, and they
are in an indeterminate form. This marks the boundary
between classical continuum and fluctuating spacetime;
its instability suggests a phase transition critical point.

Endpoints: For _X_ _[α]_ _<_ 0 with _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_ _[<]_ [ 0, the flow orig-]
inates from the SUV endpoint ( _L_ _[α]_ _→_ 0, _β →−∞_ )
and proceeds either to the SIR endpoint ( _L_ _[α]_ _→−∞_,
_β →−∞_ ) when _ζ_ _[α]_ = _ζ_ + _[α]_ [(with] _[ β <]_ [ 0), or to the SIR]
fixed point C when _ζ_ _[α]_ = _ζ−_ _[α]_ [(with] _[ β <]_ [ 0). Conversely,]
for _X_ _[α]_ _>_ 0 with _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_ _[>]_ [ 0, the flow begins at the SUV]

_β >_ 0), or to the SIR fixed point D for _ζ_ _[α]_ = _ζ−_ _[α]_ [(with]
_β >_ 0). As shown in FIG. 5, the SUV endpoints are

characterized by _aα_ = 0, _bα_ = _±∞_, _aαbα_ = _±_ - _|X_ ~~[¯]~~ 0 _[α][|]_ [,]

_dX_ _[α]_ = 0, and _−daα_ = 0, while the IR endpoints exhibit
_aα_ = [1] [,] _[ b][α]_ [ = 0,] _[ a][α][b][α]_ [ = 0,] _[ dX]_ _[α]_ [ =] _[ ±∞]_ [, and] _[ −][da][α]_ [ = 0.]

The renormalization group flow exhibits distinct behaviors at the endpoints, which are not fixed points since
_β ̸_ = 0 in these regimes.


The existence of a UV fixed point ensures a welldefined and predictive high-energy limit for the theory.



The renormalization group flow traces the emergence of
physical phenomena with the fundamental microscopic
description. While traditional renormalization focuses on
the running of coupling constants in the action, this work
promotes the measurement scales themselves to running
parameters, mapped onto geometric scaling functions
_L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ). Consequently, the _β_ -function here describes the
scale-dynamical evolution of _L_ _[α]_, rather than perturbative corrections to couplings.


As cataloged in TABLE II and FIG. 5, _aα_ exhibits simple power-law asymptotics. As _X_ _[α]_ _→_ 0 one finds _aα ∝_
_|X_ _[α]_ _|_ [1] _[/]_ [2], hence _aα →_ 0 (SUV fixed points A/B). Similarly, approaching the singular SUV endpoints _X_ _[α]_ _→_ _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_
gives _aα ∝|X_ _[α]_ _−_ _X_ [¯] 0 _[α][|]_ [1] _[/]_ [2][, so] _[ a][α]_ [again vanishes as the]
square root of the distance to _X_ [¯] 0 _[α]_ [. In the large-scale limit]
_X_ _[α]_ _→±∞_ the two solution branches separate: the “+”
branch tends to a constant _aα →_ [1] 2 [up to] _[ O]_ [(1] _[/X]_ _[α]_ [) cor-]

rections, while the “ _−_ ” branch grows linearly _aα ∝_ _X_ _[α]_

(the IR divergent branch to C/D).


By anchoring itself in differential measurement and
scaling factors, this mathematical structure embeds
spacetime fluctuations directly into geometry, offering an
intrinsic approach to fluctuation spacetime. The key is
a measurement duality that reveals a natural discrete
structure, connecting the operation of measurement to
the nature of fluctuations, discreteness, and the emergence of classical geometry.

works, such as Hoˇrava–Lifshitz gravity [46], further suggest that space and time may scale differently at high
energies, leading to novel dispersion relations and potential observational consequences.
In this work, we introduce an approach in which the
usual position and momentum operators are endowed
with local scaling functions and rescaling factors to capture spacetime fluctuations at the microscale. By defining dimensionless scaling operators and computing their
commutators, we reveal how a fluctuation-dependent
scaled Planck constant deforms the canonical algebra.
This deformation naturally leads to a generalized scale
fluctuation uncertainty relation.
First, we define the rescaled momentum operator. Let


_∂_ _∂_
_p_ ˆ _α_ = _−i_ ℏ _∂x_ _[α]_ [=] _[ −][i r]_ [ℏ] _[a][α]_ _∂X_ _[α]_ _[p]_ _α_ [0] _[,]_ (37)

**III.** **SCALING-OPERATOR QUANTIZATION**


**A.** **Deformed commutators**


In parallel, various modifications of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle have been proposed to encode a minimal length into quantum mechanics. Noncommutative
geometry [43], generalized uncertainty principles (GUP)

[44], and doubly special relativity (DSR) [45] all predict
deformations of the canonical commutation relations that
become significant near _lp_ . Anisotropic scaling frame


(38)
where the consistency selection _p_ [0] _α_ [=] _[ p]_ [0][ of momentum]
reference is a global gauge. Taking the expectation value
in a spacetime-fluctuation state _|_ Φ _⟩_, allows us to identify
a dimensionless mass scale _rm_ by

_p_ [2] = _rm_ [2] _[r]_ _c_ [2][(] _[p]_ [0][)][2][ =] _[ ⟨]_ [Φ] _[|][p]_ [ˆ] _[µ][p]_ [ˆ] _[µ][|]_ [Φ] _[⟩][,]_ (39)


where _rc_ and _rm_ are dimensionless, defined relative to
fixed reference constants, respectively [40].
Next, we define the rescaled position operator via

_x_ ˆ _[α]_ = _L_ [ˆ] _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [+ ˆ] _[x]_ 0 _[α][,]_ (40)

where _L_ [ˆ] _[α]_ ( _X_ ) is the local scaling function, _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [is the]
reference length, and ˆ _x_ _[α]_ 0 [is a fixed reference coordinate.]
The nontrivial commutator then arises from the product
of _L_ [ˆ] _[α]_ ( _X_ ) _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [with the differential operator in ˆ] _[p][α]_ [. The]
operator commutator is defined as


[ˆ _x_ _[α]_ _,_ ˆ _pα_ ] = ˆ _x_ _[α]_ _p_ ˆ _α−p_ ˆ _αx_ ˆ _[α]_ _,_ no sum on _α_ (same to following)

Acting on a test function _f_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ), one finds

where _L_ [ˆ] _[′][α]_ = _[d][L]_ [ˆ] _[α]_


So that the operator-valued commutator is

[ˆ _x_ _[α]_ _,_ ˆ _pα_ ] = _i_ ℏ _aα_ _L_ [ˆ] _[′][α]_ _,_ (45)


In conventional quantum mechanics, one has [ˆ _x,_ ˆ _p_ ] = _i_ ℏ.
Here, the appearance of the scaling _aα_ and the derivative _L_ [ˆ] _[α]_ implies a scaled Planck constant, which is also
expressed into (due to Eq. (6)):


_L_ ˆ¯ _α_
ℏˆs = ℏ _aα_ ˆ _L_ _[′][α]_ = ℏ ( (46)

_L_ ˆ _α_ _[−]_ [1)] _[,]_

A vanishing commutator occurs in the limit where _L_ [ˆ¯] _[α]_ _→_
_L_ ˆ _[α]_ . This describes a regime where the local spacetime
fluctuations are suppressed. In this limit, the quantum
uncertainty from the non-commutativity vanishes, and
the formalism reduces to a classical, commuting geometry. This demonstrates how a classical limit can arise
from the fluctuating framework.
Using the generalized commutator in the uncertainty
principle,

Define ∆as the difference between the left-hand side [ˆ]
and the right-hand side of Eq. (52). If _∂iaµ_ = 0 and
_∂iL_ [ˆ] _[µ]_ = 0 (i.e., _a_ and _L_ [ˆ] are scale-independent constants),
then all derivative terms appearing in [ _D_ [ˆ] _,_ _D_ [ˆ] ], [ _D_ [ˆ] _,_ _E_ [ˆ] ], and

[ _E_ [ˆ] _,_ _E_ [ˆ] ] vanish. In that case, the commutators of _D_ [ˆ] and _E_ [ˆ]
can be expressed in the usual form of structure constants
multiplying _D_ [ˆ] or _E_ [ˆ], so ∆= 0: the standard Lorentz al- [ˆ]
gebra is recovered and the algebra closes. Conversely, if
_L_ ˆ or _a_ depend on scale, extra derivative terms _∂L_ ˆ and
_∂a_ appear; these modify the left-hand side of [ _J,_ [ˆ] _J_ [ˆ] ] so
that it is no longer given solely by structure constants
times _J_ [ˆ], but contains additional terms. Physically, those
extra terms can be interpreted as corrections to the rotation/boost generator algebra induced by local scaling
(microscopic) fluctuations, i.e. as deformations of the
standard Lorentz closure.
This section generalizes the canonical commutation relations by introducing locally scaled position and momentum operators, where the scaling functions _L_ [ˆ] _[α]_ ( _X_ )
and factors _aα_ encode microscopic spacetime fluctuations. The resulting commutator acquires a scaled Planck
constant ℏ [ˆ] _s_, leading to a generalized uncertainty principle whose lower bound depends on local fluctuation properties. In the fluctuation scale-free limit ( _L_ [ˆ¯] _[α]_ = _L_ [ˆ] _[α]_ ),
ℏˆ _s →_ 0 and the theory reduces to classical mechanics.
A linear scaling restores the standard ℏ and yields a discretized spacetime with a minimal length. The generalized angular momentum operators correct the Lorentz algebra with fluctuation-dependent embeddings. This picture suggests that the local deformations of spacetime,
encoded in the factors _aµ_, dynamically govern the effective strength of quantum non-commutativity and uncertainty.


**B.** **Locally scaled Klein-Gordon and Dirac**
**Equations**



In Ref. [40], key physical differential equations such as
the Klein-Gordon [47, 48] and the Dirac equations [49]
are transformed into scaling form, thereby encoding the
effects of microscopic spacetime fluctuations (governed
by the factors _aµ_ and _bµ_ ) on the propagation of fields.
The scaling Klein-Gordon equation is given by

_ϕ_ = 0 _,_



(58)
where, _ϕ_ is now regarded as a scaled field _ϕ_ ( _X_ _[σ]_ ) defined on the scale manifold. Its dynamics are influenced
by the local spacetime fluctuations encoded in the scaling factors appearing in the equation. This scaled field
is projected onto spacetime coordinates via the measurement relation _x_ _[σ]_ = _x_ _[σ]_ 0 [+] _[ L][σ]_ [(] _[X]_ _[σ]_ [)] _[dx]_ 0 _[σ]_ [.]
The scaling covariant Euler-Lagrange equation is modified to be







_∂L_ _∂_
_∂ϕ_ _[−]_ _[a][µ]_ _∂X_ _[µ]_




_∂L_
_∂_ ( _aµ_ _∂X∂ϕ_ _[µ]_ [)]

Thus, the corresponding scaling Lagrangian density is
given by

The key idea of this part is to view spacetime at the
smallest scales as a locally rescaled version of the smooth
geometry, so that every derivative and metric component
in the usual Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations is modified by direction-dependent scale factors. These factors
encode how nonlinear fluctuations stretch or compress
distances and times in each coordinate direction. When
one constructs the Lagrangian, each kinetic term carries
the same scale factors, and the corresponding conjugate
momenta and Hamiltonian densities reflect how local distortions of spacetime alter energy densities. In the Dirac
case, the gamma matrices are coupled to the rescaled
geometry so that the spinor field dynamics incorporate
microscale spacetime fluctuations.


**IV.** **COVARIANT GEOMETRY AND VIERBEIN**
**STRUCTURE**


**A.** **Lorentz and general covariance**


Under a Lorentz transformation Λ _[µ]_ _ν_, spacetime coordinates and partial derivatives transform according to the
standard rules of special relativity [50, 51]:


_∂_
_x_ _[′][µ]_ = Λ _[µ]_ _ν_ _[x][ν][,]_ _∂µ_ _[′]_ [=] _∂x_ _[′][µ]_ [= (Λ] _[−]_ [1][)] _[ν]_ _µ_ _[∂]_ _ν_ _[.]_


In the present framework, we adopt a fundamental postulate: all inertial observers employ the same fixed reference length scale for measurements. This is implemented
through the invariant reference length condition:


_dλ_ 0 = _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [=] _[ dx]_ 0 _[β]_ [=] _[ dx]_ 0 _[′][α]_ [=] _[ dx]_ 0 _[′][β][,]_ (67)


which ensures a consistent operational foundation across
different reference frames.
The physical coordinates are expressed in terms of scaling functions as


_x_ _[µ]_ = _L_ _[µ]_ ( _X_ _[µ]_ ) _dx_ _[µ]_ 0 [+] _[ x]_ 0 _[µ][.]_


Under Lorentz transformation, the coordinates transform
as


_x_ _[′][µ]_ = Λ _[µ]_ _ν_ _[x][ν]_ [ = Λ] _[µ]_ _ν_ _[L][ν][dx][ν]_ 0 [+ Λ] _[µ]_ _ν_ _[x][ν]_ 0 _[.]_


Physically, _x_ _[µ]_ 0 [is just another set of coordinate compo-]
nents, representing the position of the ‘origin” or reference point” in spacetime. resulting in the reference point
_x_ _[µ]_ 0 [transforms as a vector,] _[ x]_ 0 _[′][µ]_ = Λ _[µ]_ _νx_ _[ν]_ 0 [, and invoking]
the invariant reference length condition, we obtain the
transformation law for scaling functions:


_L_ _[′][µ]_ = Λ _[µ]_ _ν_ _[L][ν][.]_ (68)


Thus, the scaling functions _L_ _[µ]_ transform as Lorentz vectors.

To proceed, we postulate that the scale coordinates _X_ _[µ]_

transform as Lorentz vectors:


_∂_ _∂_
_X_ _[′][µ]_ = Λ _[µ]_ _ν_ _[X]_ _[ν][,]_ _∂X_ _[′][µ]_ [= (Λ] _[−]_ [1][)] _[ν]_ _µ_ _∂X_ _[ν]_ _[.]_ (69)


This assumption is natural given the vectorial character
of _L_ _[µ]_ and the relation _dX_ _[µ]_ = _aµL_ _[µ]_ . Comparing both
sides of the transformed derivative relation, we deduce
the invariance of scale factors:


_a_ _[′]_ _µ_ [=] _[ a][µ][.]_ (70)


That is, the scale factors _aµ_ remain invariant under
Lorentz transformations. Consequently, the second-order
factors _bµ_ = _−daµ/dX_ _[µ]_ transform as covectors:


_b_ _[′]_ _µ_ [= (Λ] _[−]_ [1][)] _[ν]_ _µ_ _[b]_ _ν_ _[.]_ (71)


To extend Lorentz invariance to the scaled geometry,
we introduce scaled Lorentz transformations that preserve the hierarchical metric structures. For the firstorder scaled geometry, we define:

these spectral properties.
The principle of general covariance requires forminvariance of physical laws under general coordinate

where, the amplitude coordinates _aµ_ are scalars under
general coordinate transformations, _∂a∂aα_ _[′]_ _µ_ [=] _[ δ]_ _µ_ _[α]_ [. Hence,]
_g_ ˜ _µν_ is invariant under general coordinate transformations.
In this scale-based framework, the coordinate _X_ _[µ]_ represents a fluctuation-sensitive rescaled coordinate system
defined via _dX_ _[µ]_ = _aµL_ _[µ]_, where _aµ_ encodes quantum
fluctuation amplitudes along each direction. Although
_aµ_ is not a conventional tensor, the composite operator _aµ∂/∂X_ _[µ]_ transforms covariantly, and the anisotropic
metric ˆ _gµν_ = [Ω _µν_ [(] _[a]_ [)][]] _[−]_ [1] _[g]_ _µν_ [maintains proper transforma-]
tion properties under general coordinate changes. This
defines a first-order scale geometry ( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _g, X_ _[µ]_ ), encoding local scale effects induced by spacetime fluctuations.
Practically, _aµ_ influences field propagation, dispersion
relations, and integration measures. Upon quantization,
the spectral properties and self-adjointness of these operators govern the mathematical consistency of constructs



where we have used the invariance _a_ _[′]_ _µ_ = _aµ_ . For

Thus, Ξ preserves the first-order scaled metric ˆ _g_ .
The standard Lorentz transformation Λ preserves the
Minkowski metric _η_, while the scaled transformations Ξ
preserve the first-order metrics ˆ _g_ . The directional scale
factors _aµ_ remain invariant under Lorentz transformations, carrying intrinsic fluctuation spectra that cannot


such as the micro-area operator and the associated state
counting. In summary, _aµ_ is interpreted as a collection
of direction-labeled, dimensionless scalar factors whose
anisotropic amplitudes embody the fundamental degrees
of freedom encoding the intrinsic local structure and dynamics of microscopic spacetime fluctuations.
The second-order factors _bµ_ = _−daµ/dX_ _[µ]_ capture
non-uniformities in scale deformations, leading to the
second-order metric ˜ _gµν_ = [Ω _µν_ [(] _[b]_ [)][]] _[−]_ [1] _[g]_ [ˆ] _µν_ [, which remains]
invariant under general coordinate transformation. Together, _aµ_ and _bµ_ define a hierarchical, fluctuation-driven
geometry with generalized covariance at each level, realized through successive anisotropic conformal transformations.
Operationally, _aµ_ exhibits dual characteristics: in
mixed tensor-scale expressions, it functions as a
direction-dependent multiplicative coefficient without
triggering index contraction; when treated as coordinates
on _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)], it follows standard differential geometry rules
after reparameterization. The composite operator _aµ∂X_ _µ_
and scaled constructions ensure that field equations and
geometric objects maintain general covariance.
Concerning covariance, we make a summary as following: the reference lengths _dx_ _[α]_ 0 [and] _[ dx]_ 0 _[′][α]_ [, reference mo-]
menta _p_ [0] _µ_ [and] _[ p]_ _µ_ _[′]_ [0] [are the same across different reference]
frames, respectively. The scale factors _aµ, ζµ, ξµ_ are dimensionless, direction-dependent invariants under coordinate transformations. The micromeasures _L_ _[µ]_, secondorder factors _bµ_, and metric ˆ _g_ are Lorentz-covariant. The
metric ˜ _g_ is a generalized invariant, and ˆ _g_ is generally covariant.


**B.** **The connection of** _aα_ **to the vierbein** _e_ _[m]_ _µ_


To establish a rigorous connection between the scale
factors _aα_ and the standard vierbein formalism, we begin
by recalling the fundamental role of the vierbein in curved
spacetime geometry. At every point _x_ in the curved
spacetime ( _M, gµν_ ), we select a set of local orthonormal
bases _{em_ ( _x_ ) _}_, where Latin indices _m, n_ = 0 _,_ 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 represent local Minkowski (Lorentz) indices, and Greek indices
_µ, ν_ = 0 _,_ 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 represent coordinate indices.
This set of bases can be written as


_em_ ( _x_ ) = _em_ _[µ]_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _[ ∂][µ][,]_ or _e_ _[m]_ ( _x_ ) = _e_ _[m]_ _µ_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _[ dx][µ][,]_


satisfying the orthogonality relations


_em_ _[µ][e][n]_ _µ_ [=] _[ δ]_ _m_ _[n]_ _[,]_ _e_ _[m]_ _µ_ _[e]_ _m_ _[ ν]_ [=] _[ δ]_ _µ_ _[ν][.]_


The vierbein relates the metric _gµν_ ( _x_ ) to the local
Minkowski metric _ηmn_ = diag( _−_ 1 _,_ +1 _,_ +1 _,_ +1 _, ..._ ) via


_gµν_ ( _x_ ) = _e_ _[m]_ _µ_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _[ e][n]_ _ν_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _[ η][mn][.]_


Thus, the vierbein can be viewed as the “square root” of
the metric [53, 54].
Due to the equivalence principle, physical laws are naturally expressed in Minkowski space. After introducing



14


the vierbein, we can find at each point in curved space
a local inertial coordinate system where the metric measured by a free-falling observer is _ηmn_ [55, 56].
The vierbein has additional degrees of freedom: if
a metric _gµν_ is given, the vierbein can be locally
Lorentz transformed without changing _gµν_ . Specifically,
if Λ _[m]_ _n_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _[ ∈]_ _[SO]_ [(1] _[,]_ [ 3), then]


_e_ _[′][m]_ _µ_ [(] _[x]_ [) = Λ] _[m]_ _n_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _[ e][n]_ _µ_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _⇒_ _gµν_ = _e_ _[′][m]_ _µ_ _[e][′][n]_ _ν_ _[η][mn][.]_


To connect this formalism with our scaling framework,
we recall the relation between the physical metric and
the scaled metric: _gαβ_ = ˆ _gαβ_ _aαaa_ [2] _β_ [. We now present a]

minimal embedding of the anisotropic scaling factors into
the vierbein formalism. To illustrate the embedding in a
simple case, we consider a scale-local inertial frame where
the substrate metric is flat, ˆ _gαβ_ = _ηαβ_ . In this frame, the
anisotropic scaling can be embedded into the vierbein as
follows:


_gµν_ = _e_ _[m]_ _µ_ _[e][n]_ _ν_ _[η][mn][,]_


with ˆ _gµν_ = _ηµν_ and _ηµν_ = _δ_ _[m]_ _µ_ _[δ][n]_ _ν_ _[η][mn]_ [, by setting]



To restore the complete local Lorentz symmetry while
retaining directional scaling, we introduce a local scaling
Lorentz rotation through Ξ _[m]_ _n_ [(] _[X]_ [):]


_aµ_
_E_ _[m]_ _µ_ [= Ξ] _[m]_ _n_ _[e][n]_ _µ_ [= Ξ] _[m]_ _n_ _µ_ _[.]_

_a_ _[δ][n]_


This extended vierbein preserves both directional
stretching effects and local Lorentz invariance. It reproduces the anisotropic conformal scaling presented in
this work while embedding it within the standard vierbein framework, which facilitates the introduction of
spin fields and the writing of covariant derivatives using spin connections. From the transformation property

which preserves both directional stretching and local
Lorentz symmetry.
_aα_ is a scale position-dependent or dynamical quantity
in the case of spacetime fluctuations considered in this
work and its derivatives contribute nontrivially to the
spin connection. This affects the covariant derivatives of
spinor and vector fields, potentially leading to observable
anisotropic gravitational effects. The preservation of local Lorentz invariance via the matrix Ξ _[m]_ _n_ [ensures that]
the formalism remains consistent with standard vierbein
theory, even when such anisotropies are present. The
dependence of the spin connection on derivatives of _aα_
modifies the covariant derivative operator for fermions.
This results in a non-trivial, anisotropic coupling between
spacetime fluctuations and spinor fields, such as modifications to dispersion relations.


**V.** **FIRST- AND SECOND-ORDER GEODESIC**
**EQUATIONS IN SCALING MANIFOLDS**


Quantum gravity suggests that spacetime at microscopic scales exhibits complex fluctuations, challenging
classical geometric descriptions. To systematically capture these scale-dependent spacetime fluctuations, inspired by the geometric description of classical trajectories, we propose a geometric analogue for the evolution
of scale fluctuations. We hypothesize that the locally
“shortest” or “least” scale path of the scale degrees of
freedom themselves can be described by a geodesic principle on an appropriately defined abstract scale manifold.
This provides a variational principle for the dynamics of
fluctuations, analogous to the least-action principle for
particle motion. This manifold, equipped with a metric
encoding scale fluctuations, provides a geometric framework to study the evolution of scale degrees of freedom.
Furthermore, by introducing a second-order manifold for
fluctuation amplitudes, one can describe how the internal
structure of these fluctuations evolves and interacts, revealing richer nonlinear dynamics beyond the first-order
scale space. The first- and second-order geodesic equations derived from variational principles thus generalize
classical geodesic geometry to describe spacetime fluctuation in both scale coordinates _X_ _[α]_ and fluctuation amplitude spaces _aα_ . This thought offers a natural and intuitive geometric language to investigate quantum spacetime hierarchical and nonlinear structure, bridging classical geometric methods with quantum gravitational phenomena.
Let _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] be the scale space manifold, with scale coordinates _X_ _[α]_, describing different scale degrees of freedom.
Introduce ˆ _gαβ_ ( _X_ ) as a smooth metric tensor on _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] .



After the variation _X_ _[α]_ ( _X_ ) _→_ _X_ _[α]_ ( _X_ ) + _δX_ _[α]_ ( _X_ ) (with
fixed endpoints), the geodesic equations can be obtained,
ensuring torsion-free and metric compatibility _∇ρg_ ˆ _αβ_ =
0. Therefore, the first-order equations govern the dynamics of scaling coordinates _X_ _[α]_ in fluctuating spacetime:

is defined as a First-order Scaling Levi-Civita Connection
(FSLCC).
These equations are the geodesic equations on the scale
manifold ( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _g_ ), describing the evolution of scale coordinates, under the extremal scale variation, which we
interpret as representing the most natural or least fluctuating evolution of the scale degrees of freedom themselves, depicting a free evolution path on the metric ˆ _gαβ_ .
The geodesic equations on the scale manifold prescribe
the free evolution of the scale degrees of freedom determined solely by the geometry of the scale manifold. In a
local scaling-inertial frame (i.e. in a neighborhood where
ˆΓ _[α]_ _µν_ = 0), the connection contributes no coordinatedependent inertial term and the scale coordinates evolve
linearly with the affine parameter, corresponding to a locally inertial, uncoupled (or free) scale flow. This indicates that, under this coordinate description, there
is no nonlinear scale coupling introduced by the connection. By contrast, nonzero connection components
ˆΓ _[α]_ _µν_ [= 0 indicates that the local basis on the scale man-]
ifold varies with scale coordinates, affected by effective,
force-like contributions that drive departures from linear
scale evolution and generate nonlinear coupling. As discussed next section VI, it can be interpreted as effective
feedback from the amplitude distribution or microstructure onto the scale flow, leading to nonlinear interactions
and coupling between scales. Crucially, however, the intrinsic and observable content of such departures is encoded not in the connection alone but in curvature and
in the geodesic-deviation equation: a nonvanishing Riemann tensor _R_ [ˆ] _βγδ_ _[α]_ [signals irreversible inter-scale “tidal”]
effects, controls the separation or focusing of nearby scale
flows, and thus provides a quantitative measure of the
strength and stability of inter-scale coupling, whereas a
nonzero Γ with vanishing curvature can be removed by a [ˆ]
coordinate transformation and therefore reflects a choice
of parametrization rather than an intrinsic physical interaction.
The physical picture of the first-order scale manifold
may be imagined as an elastic substrate, characterizing
the fundamental stretching and contraction of spacetime


scales in different directions. In this sense, the coordinates _X_ _[α]_ describe how the elastic foundation is deformed
at the most basic level. The amplitudes _aµ_ represent the
internal fluctuation intensity defined on this substrate,
quantifying how strongly the substrate fluctuates along
each direction, thus providing a possible description of
the microstructure.
To investigate the interactions between the fluctuation
amplitudes _aα_, we can define the amplitude coordinates
_aα_ and the metric ˜ _gαβ_ on the manifold _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] . Clarifying that _aα_ are coordinates on _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] representing the
configuration space of fluctuation amplitudes. Here, the
amplitude manifold _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] is not an extension of spacetime, but rather the configuration space or field space
of the fluctuation amplitudes _aα_ . A point in _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] corresponds to a specific configuration of these amplitudes
across spacetime. A geodesic on _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)], parameterized by
_σ_, then describes a continuous transformation from one
such global configuration to another.
Note that two distinct types of coordinate transformations are introduced. The first is the diffeomorphisms
of the external spacetime (spacetime diffeomorphisms /
Lorentz transformations), under which _aα_ ( _X_ ) are proven
to be a set of scalar variables (i.e., invariant under external spacetime scale coordinate transformations). The
second is the internal reparametrization on the amplitude
manifold _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)], whose transformation rule is the standard one for internal coordinates. To avoid confusion,
we denote: external spacetime indices with Greek letters
_α, β, µ, ν, . . ._ and amplitude (internal) manifold indices
with capital Latin letters _I, J, K, . . ._ . With this distinction, reparametrize _aµ_ as _aI_ = _aI_ ( _a_ ) to be the internal
coordinates, satisfying _a_ _[′]_ _I_ [(] _[X]_ _[′]_ [) =] _[ a][I]_ [(] _[X]_ [),] _[ a][I]_ [ = ˜] _[g][IJ]_ _[a][J]_ [, and]
_g_ ˜ _IJ_ _[′]_ [(] _[a][′]_ [) =] _[∂a]_ _∂a_ _[M][′][I]_ _∂a_ _[∂a][′][K][J]_ _[g]_ [˜] _[MK]_ [(] _[a]_ [). It follows that the geodesic]

_g_ ˜ _IJ_ [(] _[a]_ [) =] _∂a_ _[′][I]_ _∂a_ _[′][J]_ _[g]_ [˜] _[MK]_ [(] _[a]_ [). It follows that the geodesic]

equation on the amplitude space possesses the correct
covariance under both types of transformations invariant
under external spacetime transformations because _aI_ are
scalars, and covariant under internal reparametrizations
because the equation is tensorial in form.
Thus, we have the following action

the second-order hierarchy of scale geometry. This approach is similar to that in physics, where ”phase space”
or the ”internal degrees of freedom space” is treated.
Although the coordinates themselves are dimensionless
scalars, a metric and connection can still be defined to
characterize the geometric properties of the fluctuation
amplitude space. This represents a conceptual extension
of scale space: from scale coordinates _X_ _[α]_ to fluctuation
amplitude coordinates _aα_, forming a hierarchical geometry. When the connection Γ [˜] _[I]_ _JK_ [vanishes, the amplitude]
configurations evolve independently and linearly, corresponding to uncoupled `“` breathing modes `”` on the elastic substrate. By contrast, when Γ [˜] _[I]_ _JK_ [= 0, it induces]
nonlinear coupling among different configurations.

In this framework, the geodesic equations specify the
natural, least-distorted trajectory, capturing how the internal states of microscope spacetime fluctuations propagate, couple, and evolve within a hierarchical geometric
structure, which can be summarized as follows: the firstorder scale manifold _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] provides the substrate frame
( _X_ _[α]_ ) for scaling, while the second-order amplitude manifold _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] describes the configurational degrees of freedom ( _a_ _[I]_ ) of the fluctuations themselves.
Although each component _aα_ carries an index, it is
fundamentally a set of dimensionless Lorentz scalar functions, each representing the amplitude of quantum fluctuations along a particular direction. It does not transform as a conventional vector field but rather as multiple scalar fields labeled by direction. Consequently, it is
mathematically consistent to treat _aα_ as coordinates on
the manifold _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] that describes the internal state or geometry of fluctuation amplitudes. This construction extends the geometric framework of scale space by introducing a higher-level manifold where the metric and connection capture the evolution of fluctuation inhomogeneities.
Clarifying this distinction avoids confusion and highlights
that these coordinates serve as parameters for a hierarchical, scale-dependent geometric structure rather than
conventional spacetime vectors.

By explicitly introducing affine parameters and applying action-based variational principles, while ensuring
metric compatibility of the connections for both the firstorder (scale ˆ _g_ ) and second-order (amplitude ˜ _g_ ) geodesic
equations, which provides an effective description of the
scale degrees of freedom ( _X_ _[α]_ ) and fluctuation amplitude
( _aα_ ) of microscope spacetime geometry. Extending classical geodesic concepts to scale space geodesics, it provides a natural geometric language and an intuitive principle of least action for investigating microscopic scale
fluctuations. The derivation of these generalized geodesic
equations establishes a complete geometric formalism for
spacetime fluctuations. While their full physical interpretation is a subject of ongoing research, they provide
a self-consistent, covariant framework for hypothesizing
about the dynamics of the microscopic spacetime structure. The first-order equations (76) might govern the
evolution of preferred scale coordinates in the presence of
fluctuations, while the second-order equations (79) could



is defined as a Second-order Scaling Levi-Civita Connection (SSLCC). Here, _aα_ is regarded as a coordinate system of a multi-dimensional parameter space, used to describe the “internal state” of fluctuation amplitudes or


constrain the allowed profiles of the fluctuation amplitudes _aα_ themselves. Future work must focus on solving
these equations in specific contexts and identifying potential observable signatures.
Within this scaling-based framework, the metrics ˆ _g_, _g_,
and ˜ _g_ form a symbiotic, hierarchical structure. The substrate metric ˆ _gαβ_ defines the elastic geometry of the scale
manifold _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] . The physical metric _gαβ_ is dynamically
shaped by anisotropically stretching on ˆ _g_ through the
scale factors _aα_ . These factors _aα_ are, in turn, the coordinates of the amplitude manifold _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)], whose intrinsic
geometry is described by ˜ _gIJ_ . This creates a closed, codependent loop: the dynamics on the amplitude manifold
(governed by ˜ _g_ ) drive the configuration of _aα_, which then
deforms the substrate ˆ _g_ into the physical metric _g_ . Consequently, no single metric exists in isolation; their meanings and dynamics are mutually defined, where spacetime
and its fluctuations co-evolve.

Levi-Civita part of ˆ _gµν_ ), the physical field equations
ultimately reduce to the equations of _aµ_ . In physical
terms, the metric _gµν_ is an object determined by microscopic degrees of freedom, arising under the algebra
and constraints of _aµ_ . This construction preserves manifest covariance while making the metric _gµν_ a scalingdetermined object. Covariance is thus realized at the
level of physical, measurement-defined geometry. The
variational principle is here formulated so that the EulerLagrange equations determine the physical metric _gµν_
through _aµ_ and ˆ _gµν_, which satisfy the constraints Eq.
(84).
To clarify the structure, it is instructive to evaluate the
explicit form of the connection in a simplified setting. In
particular, by adopting a scale inertial or a scale local
inertial frame, one can consider the contributions arising
solely from the scaling-induced terms. Hence, in the simple case where Γ [ˆ] _[α]_ _σγ_ [= 0 (e.g., ˆ] _[g]_ [ =] _[ η]_ [ or] _[ δ]_ [ metric) for scale]
measurement, one finds

The first term in _Rσµν_ _[ρ]_ [is the elastic substrate curvature]
stretched by the scale factors; the second term, _R_ [ˆ], contains contributions from _∂a ×_ Γ and mixed [ˆ] _b ×_ Γ terms, [ˆ]
as well as terms in _∂b_ and _b_ [2], and genuinely reflects the
intrinsic curvature induced by the scaling fluctuation.

In this representation, the usual concept of a local inertial
frame–where one chooses coordinates that eliminate the
connection terms and make it flat–is extended by introducing direction-dependent scale factors. A scale local
inertial frame is then defined as the coordinate system
that makes the first-order scaling connection terms vanish, and the corresponding local basis explicitly includes
the direction-dependent factors _aµ_ so that spacetime fluctuations are woven into a flat elastic substrate. If, however, the scale factors happen to be the same constant in
every direction, its effect reduces to an ordinary uniform
rescaling, and the metric ˆ _g_ becomes globally proportional
to the one _g_ . Therefore, the scale local inertial frame coincides with the classical local inertial frame of general
relativity.
For a scale-curved metric spacetime, the Lagrangian
acquires additional structural complexity. Starting from
Eq. (87,88,), one finds not only the scaled _R_ [ˆ] and pure
quadratic forms _b_ [2] contributions, but also explicit derivative terms _∂b_ and coupling terms involving the affine connection — in particular derivative couplings of the form
( _∂a_ ) _×_ Γ as well as mixed [ˆ] Γ– [ˆ] _b_ interactions, where Γ ap- [ˆ]
pears as an interacting geometric object and is not an
explicit functional of _aµ_ or _bµ_ . The Lagrangian for a
scale-curved metric spacetime and its quantization will
be derived in subsequent works.

Thus, the action is converted from _S_ [ _gµν_ ] to _S_ [ _aµ,_ ˆ _gµν_ ],
allowing for direct variation with respect to _aµ_ (and ˆ _gµν_
when necessary). The expression of the metric shifts
all physical information to the factor spectrum _aµ_ and
combinations of ˆ _gµν_ . Since the action, measure, connection, curvature, and even the Einstein tensor can
be algebraically expressed in terms of _aµ_, _bµ_ (and the

The scaling Lagrangian _L_ scale encodes the kinetic terms
of the anisotropic fluctuation modes of the scale factors. Here _Bbb_ _[ρ]_ [=] _[µ]_ denotes the sum of squared magnitudes of the scale derivatives over all directions except
the _µ_ -direction; it therefore represents the local density
of fluctuation energy (i.e., the intensity of scale fluctuations) in the transverse directions. Similarly, _Bb_ _[ρ]_ [=] _[µ]_
denotes the sum of the (first-power) magnitudes of the
scale derivatives over all directions except _µ_, and characterizes the anisotropy of the fluctuations. The coupling
term _−_ _bµ Bb_ _[ρ]_ [=] _[µ]_ couples the derivative amplitude in the
_µ_ -direction to the anisotropy in the transverse directions;
physically, it represents a nonlinear interaction between
fluctuation components (for example, an energy-transfer
or interference term between fluctuations along _bµ_ and
fluctuations in the other directions). In other words, this
term quantifies how fluctuations in the _µ_ -direction influence, and are influenced by, anisotropic fluctuations in
the orthogonal directions.
The Lagrangian presented here represents a generalized Einstein-Hilbert action formulated in an anisotropic,
scale-dependent spacetime geometry. Unlike classical
general relativity, where curvature is encoded in the
smooth metric tensor _gµν_, this framework strengthens
local fluctuation factors _aµ_ (first-order dilation) and _bµ_
(second-order non-uniformity) to encode the fluctuation
effects on the curvature. These factors characterize the
direction-dependent amplitude and variation of microscopic spacetime fluctuations, respectively.
Under isotropic limit, _aα_ = _aiso ∀_ _α_ ; _bα_ = _biso_ =
_−∂αaiso_ (equal in all directions). Therefore,

For Minkowski space _η_ _[µµ]_ = _{−_ 1 _,_ 1 _,_ 1 _,_ 1 _}_, we have tr( _η_ ) =

In the isotropic limit, where every directional scale factor
is equal and the directional derivatives coincide, the full
scaling Lagrangian reduces to a single effective kinetic
term for the overall scale field. Substituting the isotropic
values shows that the Lagrangian is proportional to the
square of the gradient of the logarithmic scale factor.
The overall coefficient of this term is proportional to the
dimensionless coupling _G_ and carries a purely geometric
dimension-dependent factor ( _D −_ 1)( _D −_ 2), the appearance of _D −_ 2 arising from the trace of the Minkowski
metric.

We rewrite Eq. ( 97) to make the matrix/quadratic
structure more explicit:

is crucial for the subsequent canonical quantization, as
it allows the quadratic form in the Lagrangian to be expressed in terms of independent modes, which are identified as the physical degrees of freedom. A necessary and
sufficient condition for _M_ to be invertible is that all its
eigenvalues are non-vanishing, i.e., det( _M_ ) _̸_ = 0. However, zero eigenvalues may appear if certain parameters
_aµ_ approach _∞_, or if they satisfy special algebraic relations that impose constraints. Under the Minkowski
convention ( _η_ 00 = _−_ 1 _, ηij_ = +1), the time component
introduces a natural negative sign in the expressions, so
_M_ is not necessarily positive definite. Whether it is positive definite depends on the relative magnitudes of the
_aµ_ : if the positive contributions from the spatial components dominate over the negative temporal contribution,
eigenvalues may become positive.
We compute the conjugate momentum of _aµ_,

If considering the anisotropic specialization of the general matrix _M_ in which the metric is Minkowskian, the
time-scale is distinct from the spatial scale, and the spatial directions remain isotropic. Concretely we set


_a_ 0 = _at,_ _ai_ = _as_ ( _i_ = 1 _, . . ., D −_ 1) _,_ _ϵ_ = _[a]_ _t_ [2] _>_ 0 _,_
_a_ [2] _s_


and we seek necessary and sufficient conditions on _ϵ_ (and
_D_ ) so that _M_ is positive definite (all eigenvalues _>_ 0).
We keep the dependence on _as_ explicit where convenient.
With the above specialization, the independent components of _M_ reduce to a timetime entry, a single spatial diagonal entry (same for each spatial direction), a
common timespace coupling, and a uniform spatial offdiagonal entry. After straightforward substitution and
algebra one obtains



In the isotropic limit, the matrix _M_ simplifies significantly. Its spectrum can be obtained in closed form for
both Euclidean and Minkowski spacetimes, as detailed
below. The Lorentzian signature naturally leads to a decoupling between the temporal and spatial sectors.
For Euclidean signature ( _η_ _[µµ]_ = +1 for all _µ_ ) _Tη_ = _D_

Because the spatial submatrix has the constant-diagonal,
constant-off-diagonal form, the spatial sector decomposes
into the one-dimensional “all-ones” direction and its ( _D−_
2)-dimensional orthogonal complement. This yields an
explicit and simple spectral decomposition.
For transverse spatial modes (multiplicity _D −_ 2) and
any vector with spatial components summing to zero
(and vanishing time component) one finds the repeated
eigenvalue



_λ⊥_ = [3] _[D][ −]_ [1]



An elementary verification is given by applying _M_ to **1**
and to any vector orthogonal to **1** .
For the conventional Minkowski choice ( _η_ =
diag( _−_ 1 _,_ +1 _, . . .,_ +1), time index _µ_ = 0), one has _Tη_ =

_−_ 1+( _D −_ 1) = _D −_ 2. Substituting into the isotropic expressions yields a decoupling between the time direction
and the spatial ( _D −_ 1)-block:

Requiring the matrix _M_ to be positive definite ensures that the quadratic form entering the action remains bounded from below. In physical terms, this
guarantees that all fluctuation modes contribute with
nonnegative energy, thereby excluding unphysical instabilities or ghostlike excitations. The spectral conditions
derived above show that only in this regime can the fluctuation basis be consistently diagonalized and quantized,
leading to a well-defined Hilbert space and vacuum structure. Hence, the positivity of _M_ provides the necessary
criterion for the stability and consistency of the spacetime microstructure quantization framework.
The eigenvalues of the fluctuation matrix _M_ scale
as inverse fourth powers of the scale factors, schematically _λ ∝_ _C/a_ [4] _iso_ [(or 1] _[/]_ [(] _[a]_ _t_ [2] _[a]_ [2] _s_ [) with] _[ C]_ [ a geometry- and]
signature-dependent prefactor). Hence the asymptotic
behavior of any eigenvalue is governed entirely by the
limit of _aµ_ ( _X_ _[µ]_ ) (see Eq. (34), TABLE II, and Fig. 5): if
_aµ →_ 0 (as at the UV fixed points A/B) then _λ →_ + _∞_ ;
if _aµ_ approaches a finite nonzero constant (e.g. _aµ →_ 1 _/_ 2
at a regular IR endpoint) then _λ_ remains finite and _O_ (1);
and if _a →∞_ (in certain IR flow branches, C/D) then
_λ →_ 0.


**C.** **Mode decomposition and canonical quantization**


The canonical quantization of general relativity faces
well-known challenges, particularly due to the constraint
structure inherent in metric-based formulations. In Einstein’s theory, the spacetime geometry is encoded in
the metric tensor _gµν_, and its diffeomorphism invariance gives rise to four first-class constraints `—` namely, the
Hamiltonian constraint ( _H ≈_ 0) and three momentum
constraints ( _Hi ≈_ 0), which restrict the physical phase
space evolution [4, 57]. These constraints introduce notable complications in the quantization process:(1) Mathematical structure: The constraints form a non-trivial
algebra, requiring Dirac’s quantization procedure. Physical states must satisfy _H|_ [ˆ] Ψ _⟩_ = 0 (the Wheeler–DeWitt
equation) [58], though obtaining explicit solutions remains challenging due to operator-ordering ambiguities
and non-renormalizability [59]. (2) Problem of time: The
Hamiltonian constraint _H ≈_ 0 suggests a lack of explicit
time evolution at the quantum level, raising questions
about the emergence of classical time [60]. (3) Issue with
observables: Physical observables must commute with all
constraints, but constructing local, gauge-invariant operators from the metric _gµν_ is conceptually and technically
difficult [61, 62]. These challenges have motivated the development of alternative approaches to quantum gravity,
including string theory [7], loop quantum gravity [4, 63],
and asymptotically safe gravity [11, 12], among others.
This persistent difficulty motivates alternative strategies in which the quantum geometry may emerge from
simpler degrees of freedom rather than direct metric
quantization. In current canonical quantization, by following Eqs. (101, 104, 105), we promote the scale fluctu

which is automatically satisfied for any _ϵ_ fulfilling Eq.
(117) and Eq. (118) for _D ≥_ 2.
Because _P_ (2) = _−_ 1 _<_ 0 and _P_ ( _ϵ_ ) _→_ + _∞_ as _ϵ →∞_,
the quadratic _P_ ( _ϵ_ ) has two real roots and positivity of _P_
for large _ϵ_ defines a threshold. Denote by _ϵ∗_ the larger
positive root of _P_ ( _ϵ_ ) = 0. Solving the quadratic yields
the explicit threshold

ation _aµ_ and its conjugate momentum _πµ_ to operators.
In this approach, we do not attempt a direct canonical
quantization of the metric _gµν_ ; instead, we quantize the
scale degrees of freedom _aµ_ . It is noteworthy that the
following quantization procedure is applicable to scaling
measurement spacetimes characterized by both scale-flat
and scale-curved metrics, while the Lagrangian in the
case of a scale-curved metric spacetime is more complex.
In the following, we will focus on the scale-flat metric
_g_ ˆ = _η_ .
In the following of this section we present a selfcontained derivation that (i) diagonalizes the quadratic
kinetic form introduced in the main text, (ii) identifies
and treats the constraints that arise when the kinetic operator is degenerate, and (iii) promotes the scale factors
_aµ_ into operators ˆ _aµ_ ( _X_ _[µ]_ ), expresses them and their conjugates ˆ _πµ_ ( _X_ _[µ]_ ) in terms of bosonic creation/annihilation
operators. The presentation supplies the normalization
conventions that guarantee canonical commutation relations, and indicates how to treat zero- and negativeeigenvalue (ghost) modes.
Since _M_ is real symmetric, there exists an orthogonal
matrix _S_ such that


_S_ _[T]_ _MS_ = diag( _λ_ 0 _, λ_ 1 _, . . ., λD−_ 1) _,_ _S_ _[T]_ _S_ = _I,_


where _S_ = - _s_ [(0)] _, s_ [(1)] _, . . ., s_ [(] _[D][−]_ [1)][�] is the orthogonal matrix whose columns _s_ [(] _[i]_ [)] are the (normalized) eigenvectors
of _M_ . Define the modal coordinates **q** by **a** = _S_ **q** and
the corresponding modal momenta **p** by _**π**_ = _S_ **p**, where


**a** = ( _a_ 0 _, a_ 1 _, . . ., aD−_ 1) _[T]_ _._


From _**π**_ = 2 _GM_ **v** we obtain



23


potential is present, it determines the physical modal frequency. In the absence of an explicit potential, one may
temporarily introduce a positive reference frequency as
a mathematical regulator, but its numerical value is not
physical until linked to a specific stabilizing kernel.
The algebraic relation _**π**_ = 2 _GM_ **v** implies in modal
form


_pi_ = _mi vi,_ ( _i ∈_ _I_ phys); _pi_ = 0 _,_ ( _i ∈_ _I_ null) _,_ (124)


where, partition the spectrum into the physical, nonzero
eigenvalues


_I_ phys = _{i | λi >_ 0 _}_


and the _null_ (zero-eigenvalue) set _I_ null. The null modes
generate algebraic constraints that are treated in the next
subsection. To diagonalize the kinetic term and cast the
modal Hamiltonian into standard form, we define the effective modal mass _mi_ for each mode via:


_mi_ = 2 _Gλi,_ (125)


obtained from the kinetic kernel eigenvalue. This quantity characterizes the inertia or resistance to change of
the spacetime fluctuation mode labeled by _i_ .

This is the standard expansion for discrete modes:
each original variable is a linear combination of creation/annihilation operators for each mode, with coefficients determined by the mode functions _s_ [(] _µ_ _[i]_ [)] and the
normalization scales _mi, ωi_ .
The introduction of _mi_ and _ωi_ serves distinct mathematical and physical purposes. The parameter _mi_, or


modal mass, is defined to transform the original Hamiltonian into the standard canonical form _p_ [2] _i_ _[/]_ [(2] _[m][i]_ [) +] _[ · · ·]_ [ for]
each mode. Physically, this represents an effective mass
scale for the mode in the kinetic term, where 2 _G_ is the
Lagrangian/Hamiltonian coupling constant and _λi_ is the
eigenvalue of the matrix _M_ . The parameter _ωi_, or reference frequency, should be naturally determined by the
potential energy coefficient and _mi_ (e.g., _ωi_ [2] [=] _[ k][i][/m][i]_ [)]
when a potential energy term is present, allowing the
Hamiltonian to be diagonalized via the operators _d_ [ˆ] _i_ into
the form _ωi_ ( _d_ [ˆ] _[†]_ _i_ _[d]_ [ˆ] _[i]_ [ + 1] _[/]_ [2). In the absence of an explicit]
potential, _ωi_ functions merely as a reference scale; while
different choices alter the zero-point energy and operator
decomposition weighting, they do not affect the fundamental commutation structure of the modes, with the
value that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian being the preferred choice.
Starting from the quadratic Lagrangian density given
in the text and adding appropriate orthonormalization

namely


        _πµ_ ( _X_ ) = 2 _G_ _dY Mµν_ ( _X, Y_ ) _vν_ ( _Y_ ) _._ (129)


Eliminating _v_ yields the reduced Hamiltonian functional
(valid if _M_ _[−]_ [1] exists):

The _M_ -matrix serves as the fundamental kinetic kernel
that encodes the anisotropic coupling between spacetime
fluctuation modes along different coordinate directions.
Physically, the eigenvalues _λi_ represent the effective inertia or modal mass of each fluctuation mode, quantifying how strongly quantum fluctuations resist amplitude
changes. The eigenfunctions Φ _µ_ ; _i_ ( _X_ ) describe the spatial profile of these fluctuation modes within the scale
manifold _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)], mapping how microscopic spacetime deformations propagate through different scale coordinates.
If _λi <_ 0, then _mi <_ 0 and the corresponding mode is a
ghost (instability) that must be removed or treated specially.
The integral eigenproblem uses position-dependent
eigenfunctions Φ _µ_ ; _i_ ( _X_ ) to diagonalize the symmetric kernel _Mµν_ ( _X, Y_ ) in function space, with orthonormality
defined by integrals and completeness as a resolution of
the identity. The matrix form treats _M_ as a finite real
symmetric matrix and diagonalizes it with an orthogonal matrix _S_ whose columns are discrete eigenvectors
_s_ [(] _[i]_ [)] . These notations are equivalent when the composite index ( _µ, X_ ) is flattened or the continuous domain is
discretized; care must be taken with quadrature weights,
normalization conventions, and the treatment of degenerate or zero modes. They yield identical modal amplitudes
_qi, pi_ and modal masses when mapped consistently.

(for example, _qα_ = 0) and construct Dirac brackets, or
(b) perform a direct reduction by eliminating the nullmode sector entirely. Both approaches lead to a reduced
canonical algebra on the physical subspace; the theory of

that the spacetime fluctuation modes are non-interacting
and unstable at this level of description (source-free vacuum spacetime). Nevertheless, the kinetic energy term
itself gives rise to effective parameters (specifically, the
modal masses _mi_ and frequencies _ωi_ ) through the process
of mode decomposition and quantization. These parameters originate from the geometric structure encoded in the
scale factors _aµ_ and _bµ_ . Thus, in this formulation, the energy stems entirely from the kinetic contributions of the
fluctuations. These modes correspond to the fundamental quantum fluctuations of spacetime. The structure of
this Hamiltonian is consistent with a central premise of
this work: that the microscopic structure of spacetime
can be described as a collection of quantum fluctuation
modes, whose dynamics resemble those of a free bosonic
field. A more complete characterization of the physical
ground state and excitation spectrum, however, would
require the introduction of a stabilizing potential term.

and all other commutators vanish.
For Zero modes ( _λi_ = 0): these are constrained directions. After gauge-fixing or reduction, they are absent from the physical expansions (140). If one does not
eliminate them explicitly, physical states must satisfy the
Dirac constraint operators ˆ _pi|_ Ψphys _⟩_ = 0 for all null labels
_i_ .
For Negative modes ( _λi <_ 0): these produce negative
modal masses _mi <_ 0. Such modes render the quadratic
form indefinite and typically correspond to ghosts (instabilities). A physically acceptable quantization requires
either that these modes are gauge (and removed by constraints) or that parameters are adjusted so they do not
appear in the physical spectrum. Retaining them in a
naive Fock construction yields a Hamiltonian unbounded
from below and is not physically acceptable.

with _ωi_ [2] _[>]_ [ 0.] In the limiting case _ωi →_ 0 (pure kinetic/free case), the required squeeze diverges and the
spectrum becomes continuous; this limiting behavior signals that a small regularizing potential (finite _ωi_ ) is
needed to define normal modes properly.
From here on, we work exclusively on the reduced
(physical) sector and omit the subscript “phys” where
no ambiguity arises.
Equations (140) provide the explicit, canonical expansion of the operators ˆ _aµ_ ( _X_ ) and ˆ _πµ_ ( _X_ ) in terms of
bosonic creation and annihilation operators on the reduced physical Fock space. The construction is independent of whether the spectrum is discrete or continuous,
making the role of constraints manifest, and provides a
clear pathway for both analytical and numerical implementations. Choosing frequencies _ωi_ when a physical
restoring kernel _K_ is available, which simplifies the algebra and ensures that the modal operators _d_ [ˆ] _i_ diagonalize the modal Hamiltonians without further Bogoliubov

The introduction of the finite modal frequency _ωi_ and
the subsequent construction of a full harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian are necessary steps to ensure the mathematical consistency of the quantization procedure and to obtain a physically viable theory with a stable ground state.
The purely kinetic Hamiltonian _H_ [ˆ] _∝_ _p_ ˆ [2], which arises
from the fluctuation modes, is pathologically deficient

uum), and its attempted diagonalization leads to divergent Bogoliubov transformations. These issues prevent
the definition of a Fock space of particle states and undermine unitarity. Introducing the potential energy term
1
2 _[m][i][ω]_ _i_ [2] _[q]_ [ˆ] _i_ [2] [rectifies this by providing the essential restor-]
ing force that regularizes the theory. This transforms the
Hamiltonian into a non-degenerate, quadratic form that
can be properly diagonalized, yielding a discrete spectrum and a well-defined vacuum, which are fundamental
prerequisites for any subsequent physical interpretation
and application.
The diagonalized Hamiltonian _H_ ˆ _i_ carries profound
physical meaning. It recasts the picture of spacetime microstructure from one of free, featureless fluctuations to
a collection of quantum harmonic oscillators, each with
a characteristic frequency _ωi_ intrinsic to the geometry
itself. Consequently, the energy of each mode becomes
quantized in discrete units of _r_ ℏ _ωi_, and the operators _d_ [ˆ] _[†]_ _i_
and _d_ [ˆ] _i_ acquire the clear physical interpretation of creating and annihilating discrete elementary excitations, or
quanta, of spacetime. The constant term [1] 2 _[r]_ [ℏ] _[ω][i]_ [ repre-]

sents the zero-point energy of each mode, a signature
of irreducible quantum vacuum fluctuations. Most importantly, this discrete energy level structure is the very
foundation that enables the statistical mechanical counting of quantum states, which is essential for deriving the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
To generate the modal restoring term [1] 2 _[m][i][ ω]_ _i_ [2] _[q]_ [ˆ] _i_ [2][, one]

adds a quadratic restoring kernel directly on the original scaling _aµ_ . Introduce a symmetric kernel matrix

as required.
A simple local example is _Kµν_ ( _X, Y_ ) = _ϱ_ [2] _δµν δ_ ( _X −_
_Y_ ), which projects to _Kii_ = _ϱ_ [2] and hence gives

_ωi_ [2] [=] _[ϱ]_ [2] _._ (149)

_mi_


Note that _K_ must be chosen self-adjoint and so that
_miωi_ [2] _≥_ 0 for physical oscillatory modes; genuine
gauge/constraint directions (zero modes of _M_ ) should
be treated by constraint reduction (Dirac/BRST).
The squared frequency is a stiffness-to-mass ratio, so
larger stiffness or smaller mass raises the frequency and
vice versa. They differ, however, in physical origin and
infrared/ultraviolet behavior. With a constant _ϱ_ [2], a
mode-independent (or local) “mass” term typically produces a nonzero gap ( _ω_ finite as _aµ →_ _constant_ ) and
behaves like an optical mode in condensed-matter language; it therefore contributes a modewise zero-point energy [1] 2 _[r]_ [ℏ] _[ω]_ [ that is insensitive to long-wavelength kinemat-]

ics. Practically, stability requires the stiffness and _mi_ to
be positive; a negative numerator signals a linear instability (imaginary _ω_ ). In sum, _ω_ is a natural frequency
scale, corresponding to the “elastic response” of spacetime microstructures; _Kij_ are not only the “harmonic
oscillator stiffness” scale constant for each mode, but also
equivalent to the modal projection of the quadratic selfinteraction kernel of the original scaling _aµ_ ; _mi_ is the
“mass” scale or inertia intensity of the modal.
To provide modal restoring forces, one adds a symmetric restoring kernel acting on the original scale operators
_aµ_ . The full quadratic Lagrangian then reads

_Lab_ = _G_ **v** _[T]_ _M_ **v** _−_ 12 **[a]** _[T][ K]_ **[a]** (150)

Projecting onto the _M_ -eigenbasis _{_ Φ _µ_ ; _i}_ yields the
Hamiltonian _H_ [ˆ] = [�] _i_ _[H]_ [ˆ] _[i]_ [.]
When the scale factors become constant, the construction reduces smoothly to a classical description,
providing a direct correspondence with standard lowenergy geometry. Namely, _aµ_ = constant, it signifies
a complete absence of spacetime fluctuations–the static
regime described in Section II. In this limit, the derivative _bµ_ = _−daµ/dX_ _[µ]_ vanishes identically. Consequently,
the kinetic term in the Lagrangian, which is built from
_bµ_ (or _vµ_ ), disappears. Simultaneously, the potential
energy term, which is quadratic in _aµ_, reduces to a
constant value, contributing only a fixed offset to the
energy density without any dynamical content. The
Hamiltonian, therefore, loses all its quantum-mechanical,
operator-valued character. This state describes a rigid,
non-fluctuating spacetime where the scaled metric ˆ _gµν_
is simply a constant conformal rescaling of the physical
metric _gµν_ . Thus, the formalism smoothly reverts to a
classical, deterministic geometric description, as required
for correspondence with classical general relativity in the
low-energy, macroscopic limit.
From the most fundamental perspective, the potential
energy term itself is a quadratic representation of spacetime fluctuations, described by the scale factors _aµ_ . The

A sufficient and explicit choice that yields uncoupled

Using the modal normalization and _mi_ = 2 _G λi_ (as defined in the text), one then obtains


_Kij_ = _mi ωi_ [2] _[δ][ij]_ [=] _[ k][i][δ][ij][,]_ (147)


and therefore


∆ _H_ pot = 21     - _mi ωi_ [2] _[q]_ _i_ [2] _[,]_ (148)

_i_


origin of this term lies in the intrinsic quantum fluctuations of spacetime. It describes the self-interaction of
these spacetime fluctuations, where the kernel _K_ is an
inherent property of spacetime geometry, characterizing
its intrinsic stiffness in resisting metric fluctuations. This
perspective suggests a possible mechanism for the origin
of the cosmological constant: it could emerge as a residual vacuum energy density when the fundamental fluctuations are suppressed, leading to a classical spacetime
geometry.
This framework could, in principle, be constrained
or tested by future high-precision observations, such as
measurements of primordial gravitational waves, searches
for vacuum birefringence, or comparisons of ultra-precise
atomic clocks. Primordial gravitational waves, a relic
from the early universe, could carry imprints of these
fundamental spacetime fluctuations. Furthermore, the
fluctuating metric may manifest as vacuum birefringence,
altering the propagation of light over cosmic distances.
Finally, on laboratory scales, ultra-precise atomic clocks
could detect minuscule variations in the flow of time, providing a direct probe of the metric’s microscopic dynamics.


**E.** **Hilbert space and operator domains of** ˆ _aµ_ **and** ˆ _πµ_


In the present framework, the scale operator ˆ _aµ_ ( _X_ )
and its conjugate momentum ˆ _πµ_ ( _X_ ) are defined as
operator-valued distributions acting on a Fock space constructed from the physical eigenmodes of the kinetic kernel. Formally, one introduces a complete spectral decomposition of the symmetric kernel _Mµν_ ( _X, Y_ ), and projects
the fields onto the corresponding modal coordinates _qi_
and _pi_ . Each non-vanishing eigenvalue _λi_ defines a physical mode with effective mass _mi_ = 2 _Gλi_, which can be
quantized as a harmonic oscillator by introducing creation and annihilation operators _d_ [ˆ] _[†]_ _i_ [and ˆ] _[d][i]_ [. The Hilbert]
space _H_ phys _[space]_ [is therefore the bosonic Fock space]

on which all canonical commutation relations Eq.141 are
satisfied.
We assume that for all retained modes ( _i_ ) _∈_ _I_ phys with
positive _mi_, the modal coordinates ( _qi, pi_ ) are essentially
self-adjoint on _D_ fin. Under this assumption, they extend
uniquely to self-adjoint operators on _H_ phys _[space]_ [, which is nec-]
essary for their interpretation as physical observables.


**F.** **Zero-point energy**


Zero-point energy denotes the irreducible ground-state
energy of quantized degrees of freedom. In nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics, it arises from the spectrum of the
harmonic oscillator; in quantum field theory, it is the sum
over vacuum fluctuations of all field modes. This notion
has broad consequences: in condensed matter, it underlies stability and phonon dynamics, while in cosmology
it is central to the cosmological-constant problem (the
enormous mismatch between naive vacuum-energy estimates and the tiny observed value driving cosmic acceleration [69]). More recent approaches that quantize spacetime microstructure suggest that zero-point fluctuations
may be intrinsic to geometry, with renormalization-group
flows providing a physical mechanism to regulate ultraviolet divergences and to generate effective cutoffs [4].
Within this framework, the zero-point energy of the
quantized scale modes takes the familiar harmonicoscillator form, guaranteeing vacuum stability and the
existence of a Fock-space construction. Explicitly,

This derivation shows that the quantized scale modes
yield a discrete spectrum and a stable vacuum: as _a_ iso _→_
0 the zero-point energy vanishes, while finite _a_ iso produces vacuum energy controlled by the geometric stiffness
and the mode structure. Without the oscillator structure, the Hamiltonian would admit a continuous spectrum and an unstable vacuum.
The analogy with phonons is manifest: high-frequency
modes correspond to rigid geometric fluctuations, lowfrequency modes to soft fluctuations, together forming a
“stretchable spacetime lattice” with intrinsic vacuum energy. The geometric renormalization-group (RG) flow of
the scale functions _L_ _[α]_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ), encoded by the beta function _β_ ( _L_ _[α]_ ) and the fixed points listed in TABLE I, constrains the modal spectrum and thus the ultraviolet zeropoint energy. TABLE I identifies ultraviolet-like fixed
points (A and B) at small scales and scale ultraviolet
endpoint at finite scale where _aα →_ 0, and scale infrared endpoints where _aα →_ [1] [(regular SIR endpoint)]



frared endpoints where _aα →_ 2 [(regular SIR endpoint)]

or _aα →−∞_ (O:saddle/C/D). Because the modal mass
scales as _mi_ = 2 _Gλi_ and the eigenvalues _λi_ depend on
the local magnitude of _aµ_, the RG limits of _aα_ determine
the asymptotic behaviour of _λi_, _mi_ and hence _ωi_ .
Combining _ωi_ [2] _[∝]_ _[a]_ iso [4] [with the RG limits yields the fol-]
lowing: at UV fixed points A and B, where _a_ iso _→_ 0,
modal frequencies vanish, causing the zero-point contribution [1] 2 _[r]_ [ℏ] _[ω][i]_ [ of an individual mode to tend to zero.]

The behavior of the total zero-point energy then depends
on the spectral density of these low-frequency modes in
the ultraviolet regime. At regular SIR endpoints (e.g.
_a_ iso _→_ [1] [), frequencies remain finite and] _[ E]_ 0 [UV] acquires a



_a_ iso _→_ [1] 2 [), frequencies remain finite and] _[ E]_ 0 [UV] acquires a

finite contribution proportional to _a_ [2] iso [at that scale. On]
SIR branches with _a_ iso _→∞_, modal frequencies grow
and individual zero-point contributions increase, though
changes in _λi_ and mode decoupling can modify the net
vacuum energy; the final value is determined by the regulated spectral measure.
TABLE I and the beta-flow plots (Fig. 3) show transitions between discrete/static and fluctuating phases.
When the flow reaches a discrete fixed point, the dualmeasurement construction enforces a minimal microscopic interval (nonzero _L_ _[α]_ ), truncating the high- _k_ part
in the standard quantum field theory and providing an
intrinsic ultraviolet regulator that regulates the na¨ıve divergence of the sum over vacuum fluctuations of all field
modes.
Finally, TABLE I highlights regimes where _bα_ or _aα_
diverge or vanish; such behaviour alters _λi_, can create or

ities (ghosts or gapless directions). The RG flow therefore selects physically admissible branches (those avoiding ghosts) and thereby determines the consistent modal
set that contributes to _E_ 0 [UV] . In summary, the RG dynamics govern the modal eigenvalues _λi_, modal masses
_mi_, frequencies _ωi_, and ultimately the zero-point energy.
This RG-induced phase structure supplies a natural ultraviolet regulator and a principled selection of the phys


28


ical modal spectrum, linking microscopic RG behaviour
to semiclassical quantities such as black-hole entropy and
the cosmological constant problem. The zero-point energy of the scale modes, instead of being a rigid ultraviolet divergence as in conventional QFT, is dynamically
tied to the geometric renormalization group flow of spacetime microstructure. Consequently, the observed small
cosmological constant may be interpreted as the effect of
this flow, rather than the sum over all ultraviolet modes.
The contribution of high-energy modes is renormalized
during the flow process.
In our scaling-based localization framework, the fundamental dynamical variables are the direction-labelled,
dimensionless scale amplitudes _aµ_ ( _X_ _[µ]_ ) (and their derivatives _bµ_ ), which encode the local stretch/compression of
the underlying substrate geometry and determine all local geometric and spectral quantities. The modal decomposition of the quadratic scale-sector operator produces a discrete sum of harmonic-oscillator contributions
that are constructed from these dimensionless scale factors; accordingly, the natural vacuum contribution obtained from that spectral sum is itself a dimensionless,
local quantity governed by the local values of the scale
amplitudes and their renormalization-group (RG) flow.
Physical units are recovered only by comparing microscopic interval measurements to a fixed reference length
_dλ_ 0, so the corresponding physical energy density is obtained by multiplying the dimensionless spectral quantity
_E_ 0 [UV] by the conversion factor ℏ _c/dλ_ [4] 0 [. Therefore, it is]
both natural and consistent within our formalism to define the modal (spectral) zero-point contribution as the
dimensionless local vacuum energy _E_ 0 [UV] ; physical energy
densities follow after restoration of units via the micromeasurement scale _dλ_ 0.
As a consequence, let _E_ 0 [UV] denote the dimensionless
local vacuum energy density. The corresponding physical
vacuum energy density is then


ℏ _c_ ℏ _c_
_ρ_ [(phys)] vac = ˆ _ρ_ vac _dλ_ [4] 0 = _E_ 0 [UV] _dλ_ [4] 0 _,_ (152)


where ˆ _ρ_ vac is dimensionless and equal to _E_ 0 [UV] . Using
the relation between vacuum energy and the cosmological
constant in general relativity gives

_c_ [3] _dλ_ [4] 0 = _E_ 0 [UV] _dλ_ [4] 0 _,_



(153)
with _lp_ = �ℏ _G/c_ [3] the Planck length. If one adopts the

convenient choice _dλ_ 0 = _lp_, this expression simplifies to


Λ = 8 _π E_ 0 [UV] _lp_ _[−]_ [2] _[.]_ (154)


For comparison, the observed value of the cosmological
constant is


Λobs _≈_ 1 _._ 1 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [52] m _[−]_ [2]



(155)


Thus, if _E_ 0 [UV] were generically _O_ (1) with _dλ_ 0 = _lp_, one
would expect a Planck-scale cosmological constant; instead the observed value is suppressed by roughly 10 _[−]_ [123] .
Within our scaling-based quantization framework, this
enormous suppression can be interpreted as a geometry
renormalization-group effect associated with the flow of
the scale variables. In this picture _E_ 0 [UV] is not a fixed
Planck-scale constant but depends on the spectral distribution of the scale modes. Near the ultraviolet fixed
point, the modal frequencies scale with the isotropic scale
parameter as _ωi ∝_ _a_ [2] iso [, so the zero-point contribution to]
the vacuum energy vanishes as _a_ iso _→_ 0. By contrast,
when _a_ iso approaches values of order unity (for example _a_ iso _∼_ 1 _/_ 2), the same mechanism naturally produces
_E_ 0 [UV] _∼O_ (1), resulting in the enormous mismatch.
Accordingly, this framework allows for a scenario in
which the extreme smallness of Λ _obs_ emerges dynamically from the scaling flow of the spacetime microstructure, providing an alternative to ad hoc cancellations.
This perspective therefore suggests a potential dynamical mechanism that could ameliorate the cosmological
constant problem: instead of invoking an unnatural adjustment of vacuum energy at the Planck scale, the observed suppression may arise naturally from the RG evolution of the scale degrees of freedom and the resulting
zero-point spectrum of spacetime. We emphasize, however, that turning this qualitative RG-based suppression
into a quantitative account of the 10 _[−]_ [123] factor requires
a detailed calculation.


**VII.** **MICRO AREA OPERATOR AND**
**ENTROPY OF BLACK HOLE**


**A.** **Micro area operator**


In the study of spacetime quantization, it is crucial
to define fundamental observable operators that characterize the quantum nature of geometry itself [70]. This
section constructs a micro-area operator based on the
previously established quantum theory of scaling fluctuations. The core concept is that the physical area of
a spacetime surface is composed of fundamental quantum fluctuation modes, rather than being a continuous
classical quantity. By defining an area element through
suitable combinations of the scale operators _aµ_, we reveal
the discrete microstructure of spacetime geometry. The
introduction of this operator provides the necessary microscopic foundation for deriving thermodynamic properties such as black hole entropy from first principles,
directly linking the quantum structure of spacetime to
semiclassical gravitational phenomena.
Within the framework of general relativity, the classical area of a two-dimensional surface _S_ is determined by
the induced metric,



29


where _gmn_ denotes the induced metric on the surface,
encoding its intrinsic geometry. In the present scalingbased approach with scale metric ˆ _g_ = _η_, the determinant
of the induced metric takes the form, e.g., index _µ_ = 2 _,_ 3,
_√_ _a_ 2 _a_ 3
~~_g_~~ = _a_ [2] _[.]_ (157)


Motivated by this relation and Eq. (1), we introduce the
operator associated with the microscopic area element,
defined as

_A_ ˆmin = _L_ ˆ [2] _L_ ˆ [3] _dx_ [2] 0 _O_ ˆ _,_ (158)
_a_ [2]


where the symmetrized product

_O_ ˆ = [1] 2  - _a_ ˆ2( _X_ [2] )ˆ _a_ 3( _X_ [3] ) + ˆ _a_ 3( _X_ [3] )ˆ _a_ 2( _X_ [2] )� (159)


is manifestly Hermitian and can be considered as an operator for a microscopic area through appropriate regularization and spectral processing. Eqs. (158)–(159) together provide a consistent definition of the microscopic
area operator in this setting.
Below are the steps to calculate the eigenvalues of the
double-mode mixed operator in the Fock state, including
writing it in matrix form, performing a general Bogoliubov (BdG) transformation [71, 72] to diagonalize it, and
finally writing the eigenvalue expression.
Working in the spectral/modal basis _{s_ [(] _[i]_ [)] _}_ (indices
_i, j_ = 0 _, . . ., D −_ 1 or an integral label for continuum
modes), the operators ˆ _aµ_ in terms of modal canonical

Therefore, the product of interest expands as

Reorder the operator product in Eq. (160) into normal

_d_ ˆ _[†]_ _j_ _[d]_ [ˆ] _[i]_ [ +] _[ δ][ij]_ [ we obtain]

Within the finite-mode construction presented, the operator _O_ [ˆ] is Hermitian by design, as a consequence of its
symmetrized form and appropriate normalization. This
Hermiticity is manifest in the structure of the operator: each pairing term is accompanied by its Hermitian
conjugate. Upon diagonalization (provided the non-real
branches of the spectrum are excluded), the resulting
eigenvalues are real and non-negative. The construction
relies on underlying bosonic modes satisfying the canonical commutation relations [ _di, d_ _[†]_ _j_ [] =] _[ δ][ij]_ [, and the oper-]
ator is built using only modes associated with the same
unit, so that no non-trivial cross-commutation relations
arise. Furthermore, the form of _O_ [ˆ] is invariant under twodimensional diffeomorphisms on the horizon surface, as
well as under local rotations in the intrinsic 2–3 plane,
reflecting its geometric character. The operator depends
exclusively on the intrinsic area fluctuation operators ˆ _a_ 2
and ˆ _a_ 3, with no external structural bias. In summary,
_O_ ˆ constitutes a consistent and operationally meaningful candidate for a quantum micro-area operator in this
framework.


**B.** **The black hole entropy**


Black hole thermodynamics provides a fundamental benchmark for microscopic quantum-gravity models:
any candidate theory should reproduce the BekensteinHawking relation

at least in the appropriate semiclassical limit [75, 76].
For concreteness, we adopt the Schwarzschild geometry
and count horizon microstates by partitioning the horizon into _N_ quantum units [77]. Each unit hosts _D_ local
modes whose excitations contribute additively to the unit
area. Based on Eq. (173), denoting the occupation number of mode _j_ by _nj_ and the per-quantum area weight by
_ωj_ _[A]_ [, we parametrize the unit area as]



_O_ ˆ =

_n_ =0



where _C_ is the contraction Eq. (166) and “const” denotes
the zero-point/normal-ordering shift arising from the Bogoliubov transformation. Diagonalization yields independent bosonic normal modes ˆ _en_ . Physically acceptable
quantization requires _ωn_ _[A]_ _[∈]_ [R] _[>]_ [0][; complex or imaginary]
eigenvalues signal dynamical instability, while negative
eigenvalues indicate directions where the quadratic form
is unbounded below.
The anomalous pair terms (the _d_ [ˆ][2] _,_ _d_ [ˆ] _[†]_ [2] pieces) signal
that the original _d_ [ˆ] -basis is not the eigenbasis; they correspond to correlated pair production/annihilation processes and are removed by squeezing. Stability (real positive _ω_ _[A]_ ) is necessary for a well-defined Fock quantization; zero or imaginary modes indicate gauge/constraint
directions or dynamical instabilities that must be treated
before quantization. The product ˆ _a_ 2 _a_ ˆ3 decomposes into
a c-number plus a quadratic normal-ordered operator.
The latter can be cast as a bosonic BdG problem and
diagonalized by a para-unitary (Bogoliubov) transform.



(175)
where _γ_ = _L_ [2] _La_ [3][2] _dx_ [2] 0 is the geometric prefactor and _A_ 0
collects zero-point/normal-ordering contributions. This
parametrization allows modes to contribute unequally
to the area, a feature important for physically faithful
counting.

To count the microstates compatible with a fixed total area _A_, we employ a saddle-point evaluation in the
microcanonical ensemble. This is facilitated by first considering the canonical partition function [64] for a single

momentum cutoffs, or zeta-function methods, and different prescriptions affect both _β_ 0 and the inferred microscopic scale when matching _S_ 0 _/A_ to 1 _/_ (4 _G_ ℏ).
This study starts from the first principles of quantum
spacetime fluctuations and derives the area law of black
hole entropy through microscopic state counting. To
achieve precise agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking
formula and determine the microscopic scales within the
theory, a parameter fitting procedure is employed. This
approach, similar to other quantum gravity approaches,
represents a crucial step from microscopic quantum geometry towards fully deriving classical gravity. However,
a completely parameter-free, first-principles derivation
of the Planck length remains an ultimate goal for future research. It follows that deriving the BekensteinHawking area law of black hole entropy through microscopic state counting in this framework constitutes a
model-dependent fitting procedure. A similar reliance
on matching conditions appears in other approaches that
connect entanglement or thermodynamic arguments to
semiclassical gravity [77, 82].
To make these statements explicit, we present two analytic examples that illustrate how the leading area scaling
and the logarithmic correction arise and how they depend
on modelling choices.

determines the Gaussian fluctuation prefactor (the total
variance is _Nσ_ [2] ). Thus, the leading term _S_ 0 is extensive in _A_ and reproduces an area law under the natural
assumption _N ∝_ _A_ ; the subleading logarithmic correction arises from the determinant of quadratic fluctuations
about the saddle.
Several aspects of this state-counting model warrant
clarification. First, the statistical properties, such as
_⟨nj⟩β_ and Var _β_ ( _nj_ ), depend on whether the occupation
numbers _nj_ are bounded ( _nj,_ max _< ∞_ ) or unbounded
(bosonic), which in turn influences the saddle point _β_ 0,
the leading entropy _S_ 0, and the fluctuation prefactor.
Second, the logarithmic correction to the entropy is sensitive to combinatorial assumptions. For example, treating
the _N_ units as distinguishable typically yields a _−_ [1] 2 [ln] _[ A]_

term (since _N ∝_ _A_ ), while modeling them as indistinguishable or imposing additional projection or gauge constraints can alter this coefficient, in some cases to values
such as _−_ 1 or those reported in certain loop quantum
gravity studies [79–81]. Third, the zero-point area _A_ 0
generally requires regularization, e.g., via point-splitting,

These formulae show explicitly that the identification
_S_ 0 _↔_ _S_ BH is achievable in our microscopic scaling framework. Concretely, if one fixes the effective Planck length
_lp_ by matching it to the model’s microscopic parameters (e.g. the mode-spectrum parameters _γ, ω_ _[A]_, the additive constant _A_ 0, and the effective mode count _D_ ), the
Bekenstein-Hawking area law _S_ BH = _A/_ (4 _lp_ [2][) can be re-]
covered. We emphasize that this is not a parameter-free
prediction: the value of _lp_ inferred from the matching
is sensitive to the chosen microscopic inputs, and thus
obtaining explicit numerical agreement requires specifying or deriving _γ, ω_ _[A]_ _, A_ 0 _, D_ from the underlying microphysics.
This section constructs a micro-area operator derived
from scaling fluctuations and uses it to count microscopic states of spacetime geometry. By specifying the
microstate spectrum parameters, the resulting statecounting accommodates the leading term of black hole
entropy, thereby linking the scaling-operator framework
directly to thermodynamic properties of horizons. This
connection shows that quantum fluctuations of spacetime
not only shape geometry but also provide a natural microscopic foundation for black hole entropy.


**VIII.** **DISCUSSIONS AND COMPARISON**
**WITH PREVIOUS THEORIES**


**A.** **Summary for each key section**


In section II, the micro-measurement framework describes how microscope distances at the Planck scale cannot be treated as fixed quantities but are measured by
scaling functions. Because quantum fluctuations disturb
these infinitesimal intervals, measurement outcomes depend on dynamic scaling functions that capture the degree of local stretching or compression. Three regimes
emerge: static measurements without fluctuations, linear fluctuations with simple proportional scaling, and
nonlinear fluctuations representing complex or discrete
variations. By introducing first- and second-order scale
factors, the framework encodes these fluctuations directly
into the geometry, turning the physical metric into a composite structure shaped by measurement-dependent deformations. A dual principle shows that the same microscopic lengths can be described either nonlinearly or by

equivalent linearized variables, leading to the existence
of a natural discrete structure of spacetime. In this way,
the micro-measurement framework proposes a physically
motivated approach to connecting fluctuations of spacetime with geometry description, suggesting a potential
link among measurement, discreteness, and the microscopic structure of spacetime.
Section III develops an operator quantization scheme
in which spacetime fluctuations are encoded through locally scaled position and momentum operators. Their
commutators reveal a scaled, fluctuation-dependent
Planck constant, leading to a generalized uncertainty
principle and a discrete microstructure of spacetime. Reformulated Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations incorporate these scale factors, showing how quantum fluctuations deform field dynamics while preserving covariance,
embedding microscopic spacetime fluctuations into the
behavior of quantum fields. This establishes a concrete
framework for calculating how quantum geometry influences matter.
Section IV establishes the covariance of the proposed
scaling framework under both Lorentz transformations
and general coordinate changes. It demonstrates that the
first-order scale factors _aµ_ behave as Lorentz-invariant
scalars, ensuring the physical laws formulated on the
scale manifolds respect fundamental symmetries and capture intrinsic spacetime fluctuations, while the associated
metric ˜ _g_ preserves invariance under generalized transformations. By embedding these factors into the vierbein
formalism, the work provides a mathematical bridge between the anisotropic scale degrees of freedom and standard differential geometry.
Section V extends the classical concept of geodesics
from free particle trajectory and geometric explanation
to the quantum fluctuations themselves within the scale
manifolds. It derives first-order geodesic equations governing the evolution of scaling coordinates, and secondorder equations governing the evolution of the fluctuation amplitude coordinates. This provides a geometric
language for describing the hierarchical and nonlinear
structure of quantum spacetime fluctuations, offering a
variational principle for fluctuation dynamics analogous
to the least-action principle in classical physics.
Section VI presents the canonical quantization of the
first-order fluctuation operators, treating them as fundamental scalar degrees of freedom rather than directly
quantizing the metric tensor. The construction yields
a Hamiltonian describing anisotropic ”breathing modes”
of spacetime, which is diagonalized via modal decomposition into a spectrum of independent bosonic excitations.
This establishes a covariantly consistent framework for
quantum gravity where spacetime geometry is described
by more elementary quantum degrees of freedom. The introduction of finite modal frequencies _ωi_, modal mass _mi_,
and a restoring kernel _K_ to form complete harmonic oscillators represents a crucial physical requirement rather
than merely a mathematical convenience. This construction resolves the pathologies of a purely kinetic model



34


by ensuring a stable vacuum state, a discrete energy
spectrum, and a well-defined Fock space of particle-like
excitations. Consequently, spacetime itself acquires a
quantum-mechanical structure composed of quantized
oscillators, providing the essential elements of discrete
quantum states and vacuum fluctuations. Spectral analysis reveals that the vacuum energy of these discrete harmonic modes is governed by scale geometry renormalization group flow between ultraviolet and infrared regimes.
In ultraviolet regions, individual zero-point contributions
vanish as modes become gapless, while infrared behavior exhibits discrete phases with minimal length intervals
that yield finite energy. This structure provides a natural
mechanism for regulating ultraviolet divergences while
maintaining infrared completeness, suggesting a potential dynamical mechanism that could ameliorate the cosmological constant problem.
Section VII introduces a microscopic area operator
built from scaling fluctuations to represent the quantumgeometric degrees of freedom of spacetime surfaces. By
counting the operator’s quantum states under the assumption of a fixed macroscopic area, the analysis
demonstrates that the model can accommodate the leading Bekenstein-Hawking area law, thereby providing a
consistency check that links black hole thermodynamics
to the Planck-scale fluctuation structure of spacetime.


**B.** **Physical picture of the scale factors and the**
**two-tier manifold**


The basic dynamical ingredients of the framework are
the scaling families _aµ_ and _bµ_, which together provide
a compact framework for a layered, measurement-driven
description of spacetime fluctuating geometry. Each _aµ_ is
conceived as a direction-labelled, dimensionless scale amplitude along the coordinate direction _µ_ . A useful physical analogy is to regard spacetime at microscopic scales
as an anisotropic, dynamic elastic substrate. In this picture, the factors _aµ_ represent local, directional stretches
or compressions of this substrate, while their derivatives
_bµ_ quantify the inhomogeneity of these deformations. In
this picture _aµ_ rescales an underlying substrate geometry
_g_ ˆ _αβ_ anisotropically and thereby modulates the physical
measurement metric as _gαβ_ = ˆ _gαβ_ _aαaa_ [2] _β_ [, where the frac-]

tion is to be interpreted as a scaled, direction-dependent
rescaling. Because the label _µ_ denotes directions rather
than components of a conventional Lorentz vector, _aµ_ is
therefore a collection of direction-labelled, scalar, dimensionless, scale factors.
The companion factors _bµ_ encode the spacetime inhomogeneity of these first-order amplitudes: defined
component-wise as the (negative) derivative with respect
to the scale coordinates, _bµ_ = _−∂X_ _µaµ_, it measures how
rapidly the local stretch varies across scale space. Regions with large _bµ_ correspond to strong spatial variation
in the fluctuation amplitude, indicating a highly irregular microscopic structure, whereas _bµ ≈_ 0 corresponds to


nearly homogeneous fluctuations. Crucially, the inhomogeneity of the fluctuations, encoded in the derivatives of
_bµ_, directly contributes to the connection and thus to the
Riemann curvature _Rσµν_ _[ρ]_ [. Within this framework, a non-]
trivial spacetime curvature can be described by the inhomogeneous configuration of the scale fluctuations and
the underlying substrate metric ˆ _gµν_ . This demonstrates
that what is classically identified as curvature, at a more
fundamental level, is related to the non-uniformity of the
spacetime microstructure.
These elements are organized into a two-tier geometric
picture. The first-order or scale manifold _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] carries
abstract scale coordinates _X_ _[µ]_ and the substrate metric
_g_ ˆ _µν_ ; it provides the kinematic stage on which the _aµ_ fields
live, with the familiar physical coordinates _x_ _[µ]_ obtained
operationally as a projection _x_ _[µ]_ = _L_ _[µ]_ ( _X_ ) _dx_ _[µ]_ 0 [+] _[ x]_ 0 _[µ]_ [. For]
the second-order or amplitude manifold _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] : its coordinates are the amplitude configurations _aµ_ themselves,
and its metric ˜ _gαβ_ measures distances between different
amplitude configurations. Geodesics on _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] describe
the evolution of amplitude configurations, and the dynamics defined there determine the behavior of _aµ_, which
in turn sets the effective geometry on _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] .


**C.** **Comparison with direct metric quantization**


As an alternative to direct metric quantization, this
scaling-first approach constructs physical geometry from
the scale sector; intermediate appearances of ˆ _gαβ_ are
always in combination with scale factors _aµ_ . The relation _τ_ [2] = _gαβL_ _[α]_ _L_ _[β]_ defines proper length measurements in terms of the metric _gαβ_ . In scale-sensitive
extensions of differential geometry, it is useful to distinguish between the physical measurement metric _gαβ_,
used for physical measurement, and the scaling substrate
metric ˆ _gαβ_, which encodes elastic substrate structure.
These are related via a locally anisotropic scaling transformation _gαβ_ = Ω [(] _αβ_ _[a]_ [)] _[g]_ [ˆ] _[αβ]_ [, where the scaling tensor Ω] _αβ_ [(] _[a]_ [)]
is defined using the microscopic directional scaling _aα_ .
In the isotropic limit _aα_ = _a_ iso, this relation reduces
to a global conformal rescaling. More generally, variations in _aα_ define a generalized anisotropic structure
in which the scaling coordinates _X_ _[α]_ and the substrate
metric ˆ _gαβ_ provide a higher-resolution geometric description: ( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _gαβ, X_ _[α]_ ) is an elastic substrate whose local
rescalings reflect the operational nature of microscopic
measurement.
The classical geometry and quantum fluctuations are
related through a scale-sensitive extension of the manifold ( _M, gαβ, x_ _[α]_ ) to ( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _gαβ, X_ _[α]_ ), where the scaling
coordinates _X_ _[α]_ and metric ˆ _gαβ_ provide a refined geometric description. Thus, spacetime geometry is not a fixed
classical entity but a dynamically rescaled structure tied
to the operational nature of measurement at microscopic
scales.
By contrast, conventional approaches to quantum



35


gravity typically involve direct quantization of the spacetime metric _gµν_ . However, this path encounters significant challenges, including the preservation of full diffeomorphism invariance, the handling of Hamiltonian and
momentum constraints (as in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), and non-renormalizability in perturbative treatments [83]. Moreover, the metric is not directly observable; physical measurements correspond to relational
quantities such as proper distances and time intervals,
which often require material reference frames for operational meaning [4].
The scaling-first framework shifts attention from the
direct metric degrees of freedom to the algebraic and
spectral properties of the scale factors _aµ_ (and _bµ_ ).
This shift may offer new routes to address problems encountered in metric quantization, for example, it provides alternative variables for organizing UV/IR behavior and for formulating operationally meaningful observables, but realizing these advantages requires further
study.


**D.** **Comparison with previous theories**


Our approach departs from the standard perturbative
quantization paradigm by developing a novel, scalingbased framework built on direction-dependent scaling
variables _aµ_ and _bµ_, while retaining a quadratic Lagrangian structure that allows for explicit mode decomposition. In the present scaled differential geometry, the
theory is formulated and quantized in terms of these fundamental scaling variables, avoiding the need for higherderivative regulators. In this sense, the non-perturbative
character of the geometry is encoded directly in the
fundamental variables, in contrast to being recovered
through an order-by-order perturbative expansion.
A central conceptual innovation is to reinterpret renormalization in geometric terms. Nonlinear scaling functions _Lα_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) interpolate among three regimes (static,
linear, and fully nonlinear) and their scale dependence
is characterized by a sequence of geometric fixed points.
This geometrization of renormalization provides a distinct implementation of how ultraviolet and infrared behaviors connect within a geometric framework. Crucially,
instead of removing divergences with external cutoffs,
the microscopic, scale-sensitive geometry itself supplies
a natural suppression of short-distance modes and an
intrinsic ultraviolet scale. The mechanism is therefore
inherently nonperturbative, as it does not rely on a perturbative expansion, and geometric, as the renormalization group flow is embodied in the dynamics of the scale
manifold itself.
Compared with other prominent approaches to quantum gravity, our construction offers a distinct technical
realization while preserving core geometric structures.
Unlike string theory [7], it operates without introducing extra dimensions or extended fundamental objects.
In contrast to loop quantum gravity [3], it retains the


differential-manifold language while encoding discreteness in the local scale measurement structure rather than
in pre-geometric combinatorial structures. We promote
the local, direction-dependent scale measurements and
their operator representatives to the primary quantum
degrees of freedom. In this picture, Planck-scale discreteness is encoded in the local measurement structure
instead of being imposed as a prespecified discrete structure. The approach shares conceptual features with proposals that emphasize anisotropic scaling or minimallength phenomenology, but it differs technically by maintaining a continuum, vierbein-compatible formulation in
which the scale factors transform appropriately under coordinate changes.

To place our approach in a broader landscape of nonperturbative quantum-gravity programs, we also compare it with Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)

[84–86], which defines a path-integral over causal simplicial complexes to recover continuum geometry. CDT’s
computational strength is evidenced by results like dynamical dimensional reduction and emergent de Sitterlike phases. By contrast, our framework works in a continuum Lorentzian language and promotes local scale
factors _aµ_ to dynamical quantum fields. These differing starting points give complementary strengths and
distinct challenges: CDT’s discrete, numerical setup is
powerful for probing nonperturbative phase structure but
requires further control of continuum limits and matter
coupling, while the scale-field formulation must develop a
variationally complete action, explicit propagators, and a
demonstrated closure of constraint relations. CDT’s numerically observed scale-dependent and potentially nonlocal phenomena may help inform possible nonlocal or
scale-dependent terms in effective actions for the _aµ_ .
The physical picture is that of a scale measurement
manifold: scaling coordinates and rescaled metrics provide finer resolution where quantum fluctuations are important, while the effective metric for macroscopic measurements is recovered when the scale factors become
trivial. This viewpoint is complementary to other strategies. For example, Hoˇrava-Lifshitz models [31] improve
ultraviolet behavior by imposing anisotropic scaling and
higher-order spatial derivatives at the cost of explicitly
breaking Lorentz invariance and restricting diffeomorphisms. Our framework maintains manifest covariance
while proposing a mechanism for short-distance renormalization through intrinsic, direction-dependent scale
factors. Hoˇrava-Lifshitz targets perturbative renormalizability via controlled symmetry breaking, whereas the
present work emphasizes a covariant, scaling geometric
quantization.

Our proposal also differs from asymptotic-safety and
functional-RG approaches by shifting emphasis from running couplings to running measurement scales, and it
contrasts with noncommutative[13], causal-set[14, 15],
tensor/group-field[87], and holographic constructions

[88, 89] by focusing on the quantization of measurement
structure rather than on alternative kinematics or dual



36


descriptions. Technically, this means that many standard
tools (e.g., spin-network bases or explicit discrete pregeometries) are replaced here by an operator algebra and
representation theory for the scale variables; establishing
that algebra and its representations is therefore a central
technical task.
To develop this framework into a complete theory, key
next steps include: constructing a variationally complete action with consistent matter couplings and boundary terms; deriving propagators and performing powercounting and renormalization-group analyses to probe ultraviolet behavior rigorously; and characterizing the operator algebra and representation theory of ˆ _aµ_ and [ˆ] _bµ_
to ensure a stable, positive-definite scaling geometry and
to identify or exclude pathological modes. In parallel,
one should develop phenomenological outputs (modified
dispersion relations, signatures in cosmology and blackhole thermodynamics, and other observational discriminants) and translate them into concrete, testable predictions that connect the scale-operator paradigm with
low-energy field theory and experiment.
Finally, while the framework is presented here independently, it does not preclude compatibility or integration
with existing approaches to quantum gravity. Rather
than positioning this construction as a rival, we view it
as a potentially integrable viewpoint that can interact
with and enrich other established programmes. In the
subsequent research on specific topics, further detailed
comparisons and analyses will be conducted.


**IX.** **CONCLUSION**


We have developed a framework that promotes local,
direction-dependent scale measurements _Lα_ ( _X_ _[α]_ ) and
their associated factors _aα, bα_ to the primary quantum
degrees of freedom, serving as the fundamental object for
Planck-scale spacetime. The construction employs a twotiered hierarchy of scale manifolds, a first-order manifold
( _M_ [(] _[a]_ [)] _,_ ˆ _g_ ) with coordinates _X_ _[α]_ and a second-order amplitude manifold ( _M_ [(] _[b]_ [)] _,_ ˜ _g_ ) with coordinates _aα_ . And formulates differential geometry, field equations, and canonical
quantization consistently on the first-order manifolds.
This scaling-based paradigm naturally implements a
geometric renormalization-group flow for scale variables
and admits intrinsic spacetime discreteness while preserving general covariance and a vierbein embedding.
From the formalism follow several concrete physical consequences: a generalized uncertainty relation with scaledependent coefficients; locally scaled Klein-Gordon and
Dirac equations; generalized geodesic equations governing quantum fluctuation dynamics; and first-order local
operator quantization of the scaling degrees of freedom.
Importantly, the microscopic area operator constructed
from the fundamental scaling fluctuations accommodates
the Bekenstein-Hawking area law by state counting, providing a statistical-mechanical underpinning for horizon
thermodynamics.


By formulating a quadratic action for the scale sector and performing a spectral decomposition, we obtain
discrete modal degrees of freedom that can be quantized as harmonic oscillators, with requiring that the kinetic matrix _M_ is positive-definite. We show that quantized spacetime scale modes produce a discrete harmonicoscillator zero-point spectrum whose magnitude is controlled by geometric renormalization-group flows, so that
UV fixed points suppress individual zero-point contributions while IR discrete fixed points furnish a natural microscopic regulator and vacuum energy, suggesting a potential dynamical mechanism that could ameliorate the
cosmological constant problem. The framework yields
modal masses and frequencies determined by local scale
factors, and it prescribes a consistent projection onto the
physical spectral sector, enabling a Fock-space construction.
As a conclusion of this work, we have developed a comprehensive scaling-based framework for spacetime quantization that provides a concrete mathematical foundation
for investigating Planck-scale geometry, while acknowledging that further development is required to establish
a complete theory. The paper provides a set of defi

nitions, demonstrates internal consistency, and presents
physically motivated constructions that together form a
systematic starting point for further mathematical development and phenomenological exploration. Several important issues remain to be addressed in future work, including but not limited to: extension to scale-curved substrate, full operator-theoretic treatment of second-order
fluctuations, coupling to matter fields, closure of constraint algebras, rigorous analysis of the classical limit,
comprehensive stability studies of the quantum vacuum,
and predictions for observations.
