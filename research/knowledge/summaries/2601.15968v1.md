**Abstract**


_Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance but_
_often fail to generate outputs that align with human pref-_

_Align, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for ef-_
_ficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modi-_
_fying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-_
_rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model’s_
_generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory_

**1. Introduction**


Diffusion models learn score function [46] to gradually
transform a random noise into a structured output, offering
state-of-the-art performance in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation [26, 36, 40]. However, these models are typically
trained on a large set of pre-collected datasets ( _e.g_ ., web
images) that may not accurately represent target conditional distribution aligned with human intention and preferences. Consequently, the generated images often misrepresent users’ textual instructions and fail to reflect their
aesthetic preferences. Despite classifier-based or free advances [9, 21], models only improve prompt controllability
but still struggle to reflect fine-grained human preferences.

These challenges highlight the necessity of diffusion model
_alignment_ [31] to bridge the gap between the generated images and human preferences, enhancing semantic consistency with textual prompts and visual appeals.

Alignment of diffusion models is generally approached
through fine-tuning and test-time scaling. Fine-tuning
alignment approaches, including Reinforcement Learning
(RL) [27, 28, 30, 52, 59] and direct backpropagation

[37, 44], optimize target rewards based on explicit reward signals or implicit feedback from preference datasets

[25, 54]. While training-based alignment methods effectively reshape the distribution to close to a desired target
distribution, their overall performance remains constrained.
Since the generation requirements and inputs to the model
( _i.e_ ., users’ input prompts and the sampled initial random
noise) vary across use cases, fine-tuning through a set of
model parameters may not account for every combination
of the desires in Fig. 2. As a result, it often suffers from the
reward over-optimization problem ( _e.g_ ., reward hacking),
leading to a severe loss of diversity and creativity.

On the other hand, test-time scaling methods perform
input-specific computing for the alignment goal during inference, through gradient-based approaches [24, 49, 56, 63]
or sampling-based approaches [33, 39]. This allows the
alignment process to be tailored to each specific requirement, _i.e_ ., executing necessary computation to dynamically
adjust the denoising trajectory and align the generated outputs with query-specific objectives. However, these testtime scaling methods incur the additional computational
overhead introduced by gradient calculation and repeated
forward sampling. Meanwhile, they also suffer from the
reward under-optimization, failing to effectively optimize
target rewards since the externally injected test-time prior is
isolated from the diffusion models’ training dynamics.

To address these limitations, we propose to train a hypernetwork to achieve efficient and effective test-time alignment of diffusion models, termed as **HyperAlign** . Starting from the sampled noise, T2I diffusion models generate results along a denoising trajectory, reflecting the input prompts. However, the results often exhibit poor aesthetic quality misaligned with human preferences and semantic inconsistency with input prompts. Leveraging the
score-based nature of diffusion processes, we formulate the
alignment task as aligning the trajectories. Unlike directly
modifying the latent states through gradient-based guidance, we aim to adjust step-wise generation operators for
reward-conditioned alignment, namely modifying the network weights of given generative models. We design a hypernetwork that inputs latents, timesteps and user prompts
and generates test-time dynamic modulation parameters to
adapt the generation trajectory accordingly. Considering the
prohibitive cost of generating full model parameters, the
hypernetwork is designed to produce low-rank adaptation

states, producing aligned and visually appealing results


weights (LoRA). To enhance efficiency, we introduce three
weights generation strategies: step-wise generation for finegrained alignment, generation at the starting point for minimal computation, and piece-wise generation that updates
adapters only at key timesteps to balance performance and
efficiency. To optimize the hypernetwork, we use reward
score as the training objective. To mitigate reward hacking, we regularize generated trajectories with preference
data, preventing the model from overfitting to proxy scores
while maintaining fidelity to genuine human preferences.
We implement the proposed method on different generative
paradigms (diffusion models [40] and rectified flows [26]).
The main contributions are summarized as:

- We propose HyperAlign, a hypernetwork that adaptively
adjusts denoising operations for efficient and effective
test-time alignment of diffusion models, ensuring that
generated images better reflect user-intended semantics in
text and appealing visual quality.

- We design different strategies for adaptive weight generation, enabling efficient and flexible alignment. Apart
from reward score as training objective, we introduce a
preference regularization term to prevent reward hacking.

- We evaluate the performance of the proposed method
with different generative models, _e.g_ ., SD V1.5 and
FLUX. HyperAlign outperforms different baseline models and other state-of-the-art fune-tuning and testtime scaling methods significantly on different metrics,
demonstrating effectiveness and superiority.

man expectations. Early works [7, 10, 37, 55, 57] directly learn preferences from reward models, but are constrained by unstable long-trajectory gradients. Therefore,
SRPO [44] employs a noise prior to predict clear data and
yields accurate reward gradient for each step. Alternatively,
DDPO [5] and DPOK [14] integrate RL to optimize the
score function [46] through policy gradient updates. Subsequently, D3PO [60] and Diffusion-DPO [52] first introduce offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), modeling human preferences from win–lose paired data. SPO

[30] and LPO [64] extend step-wise preference alignment
by training timestep-aware reward models. Diffusion-KTO

[28] adopt human utility maximization to reduce reliance on
offline paired data. Recently, Flow-GRPO [32] and DanceGRPO [59] pioneer the integration of group-wise policy
optimization paradigm [43] for improved diffusion model
alignment. TempFlow-GRPO [19] designs temporal-aware
credit assignment for intermediate-step advantage estimation and Pref-GRPO [53] replaces pointwise score maximization objective with pairwise preference fitting. To
improve the training efficiency, MixGRPO [27] adopts a
mixed ODE–SDE paradigm and BranchGRPO [29] restructures rollout process into a branching tree. Despite substantial advances in aligning diffusion models, discrepancies with human preferences and considerable computational burdens continue to pose challenges.
**2.2. Test-time Computing for Diffusion Models**


The goal of test-time scaling is to spend additional compute
during inference to obtain more desirable generations. One
naive scaling law in diffusion model sampling is to increase
the number of denoising steps [3, 58], enabling marginal
improvements. Beyond this, there are two mainstream testtime techniques: One is sampling-based strategies, relying
the reward models to evaluate multiple noise candidates and
select more favorable denoising trajectory, such as Best-ofN search [33], evolutionary search [18], _ε_ -greedy search

[39], etc. The other one is gradient-based approaches, built
on the score-based formulation of diffusion models [46].
These methods use the differentiable reward functions to
iteratively refine noise [12, 16, 49], prompt embeddings [8]
or latents [4, 24, 51, 56, 61, 63] through gradient descent.
However, these test-time scaling methods suffer from inaccurate guidance and limited practicality. Optimizing a single image on DiT-based models takes over minutes.


**2.3. Hypernetworks**


Ha _et al._ [17] proposed hypernetworks that predict weights
of a primary network, showing notable success in language
modeling [6, 23]. For vision tasks, hypernetworks are applied across various domains, including segmentation [35],
image editing [2], continue learning [50], 3D modeling

[48], personalization [20, 41] and initial noise prediction
for diffusion model [1, 13], among others.



**3. Problem Setup: Diffusion Model Alignment**


**3.1. Preliminary on Score-based Generative Models**


Diffusion models [22] capture a data distribution by learning to reverse a gradual noising process of applied to clean
data. Given a data distribution _p_ data( **x** ), the forward process
of a diffusion model [22, 45, 46] progressively perturbs a
clean sample **x** 0 _∼_ _p_ data( **x** ) with Gaussian noise toward a
Gaussian noise, following a stochastic differential equation
(SDE) under certain conditions:


d **x** _t_ = **f** ( **x** _t_ ) d _t_ + _gt_ d **w** _,_ (1)


where _t ∈_ [0 _, T_ ], **w** is a standard Wiener process, **f** ( **x** _t_ ) and
_gt_ represent the drift and diffusion coefficients, respectively

[46].
By running the above process backwards starting from
**x** _T ∼N_ (0 _,_ **I** ), we obtain a data generation process through
the reverse SDE:


d **x** _t_ =   - **f** ( **x** _t_ ) _−_ _gt_ [2] _[∇]_ **[x]** _t_ [log] _[ p][t]_ [(] **[x]** _[t]_ [)]   - d _t_ + _gt_ d **w** _,_ (2)


where _pt_ ( **x** _t_ ) denotes the marginal distribution of **x** _t_ at time
_t_ . The score function _∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t_ ) can be estimated by
training a model **s** _θ_ ( **x** _t, t_ ) [46, 47]:


min E _t,_ **x** 0 _,_ **x** _t_ - _λ_ ( _t_ ) _∥_ **s** _θ_ ( **x** _t, t_ ) _−∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t|_ **x** 0) _∥_ [2] 2� _,_ (3)
_θ_


where _λ_ ( _t_ ) is the weight function, **x** 0 _∼_ _p_ data( **x** ), _pt_ ( **x** _t|_ **x** 0)
is a transition density in Gaussian, and **x** _t ∼_ _pt_ ( **x** _t|_ **x** 0). The
approximated **s** _θ_ ( _·_ ) defines a learned distribution _pθ_ ( _·_ ).
The score-based model unifies the formulations of diffusion models [22, 45] and flow matching models [11, 32],
where the sample trajectories of **x** _t_ are generated through a
stochastic or ordinary differential equation (SDE or ODE)

[46]. For clarity and simplicity, we focus on diffusion models in the following presentation without loss of generality.
Under this unified formulation, we can naturally generalize our analyses and approach to both diffusion and flowmatching models. More details in supplementary material.


**3.2. Aligning Diffusion Model with Reward**


**Conditional diffusion models and score functions.** We
consider conditional diffusion models that learn a distribution _pθ_ ( **x** _|_ **c** ) with **c** denotes the conditioning variable. It
is trained to generate samples through a reverse diffusion
process via denoising a sampled noise **x** _T_ under the control conditioning on **c** . For image generation, **c** is the input prompts indicating user’s instruction for the generated
contents. We resort to discrete score-based model with the
variance-preserving setting [22, 45] for better discussion,
and its sampling formula is:



**x** _t−_ 1 = (1 + [1] 
2 _[β][t]_ [)] **[x]** _[t]_ [ +] _[ β][t][∇]_ **[x]** _[t]_ [ log] _[ p][t]_ [(] **[x]** _[t][|][c]_ [) +]

Figure 3. The framework of HyperAlign. Given a user prompt, the hypernetwork produces step-wise modulation weights ∆ _θt_ that are
injected into the generative model to steer the denoising trajectory (top). During training (bottom), the hypernetwork is optimized using
the reward loss and the preference-regularization loss, enabling it to produce input-specific adjustments.

This iterative denoising process forms a trajectory _{_ **x** _t}_ [0] _t_ = _T_
in the latent space, gradually transforming the noise **x** _T_ into
a clean sample **x** 0 reflecting the input prompt **c** .
**Diffusion model alignment with reward.** While existing
T2I models demonstrate strong generative capabilities, the
results frequently fall short of user expectations, showing
poor visual appeal and semantic inconsistency with the input prompts. This limitation arises because the score functions are learned from large-scale uncurated datasets, which
diverge from distribution of human preferences. To bridge
this gap, diffusion model alignment is introduced to enhance the consistency between the generated images and
human user preferences.
Relying on human preference data [25, 34, 54], we can
obtain a reward model _R_ ( **x** ) that captures human preference, _e.g_ ., aesthetic preference [42]. Through connecting
with the condition **c**, the reward model can be formulated as
_R_ ( **x** _,_ **c** ), which can be assumed to partially capture the consistency between **x** and **c** together with the visual aesthetic
preference. It can be explicitly learned from preference data
or implicitly modeled directly using data. Given a learned
_pθ_ ( **x** _|_ **c** ) and a reward model, diffusion model alignment can
be formulated as solving for a new distribution:

generation diversity. In contrast, test-time scaling methods
achieve alignment goal by using guidance to modify the
temporal states. Since the generative distribution is manifested as the trajectory of **x** _t_ in the sampling process, testtime alignment can be regarded as steering this trajectory to
better match the desired conditional distribution _pθ,R_ ( **x** _|_ **c** ).


**4. Methodology: HyperAlign**


In this work, we aim to learn a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment of diffusion models,
termed as HyperAlign.


**4.1. Test-time Alignment with Diffusion Guidance**


As discuss in Sec. 3.2, test-time diffusion alignment methods adjust the generative trajectory to better satisfy alignment objectives. Existing test-time computing strategies can be broadly categorized into noise sampling-based
and gradient-based diffusion guidance. Noise sampling
methods attempt to identify favorable noise candidates
based on reward feedback. However, exploring the vast
high-dimensional noise space is computationally expensive
and hard to converge, leading to inefficiency and underoptimized outcomes. In contrast, gradient-based diffusion
guidance directly compute the gradient from specific objectives and uses them to steer the denoising trajectory by
modifying the temporal states.
To effectively align the diffusion model through directly
injecting the guidance from reward, we aim to train a hypernetwork that generates prompt-specific and state-aware
adjustments at each denoising step. This design maintains
computational efficiency by amortizing the costly test-time
optimization into a compact and learnable modeling process
during finetuning.
Before introducing the proposed method, we first ana


where _γ_ is the KL regularization coefficient controlling the
balance between reward maximization and consistency with
the base model. Prevalent training-based alignment methods optimize the target rewards through RL [27, 28, 30, 52,
59] and direct backpropagation [37, 44]. Although effective, these approaches often incur substantial computational
overhead and risk over-optimization, leading to degraded

lyze diffusion guidance approaches that achieve alignment
by leveraging generative gradients to steer the denoising trajectory. Based on Bayes’ rule, we can derive an approximate expression of _∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t|c_ ) _≈∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t_ ) +
_∇_ **x** _tR_ ( **x** 0 _|t, c_ ), where the first term corresponds to the unconditional score and does not require extra optimization.
Thus, we focus on the second term, which injects reward
gradient into the denoising process:



1         - _√_
_∇_ **x** _tR_ ( **x** 0 _|t, c_ ) = ~~_√α_~~ ~~¯~~ _t_ _·_ _∂_ _[∂R]_ **x** 0 _|t_ _·_ **I** _−_



substitute for Eq. (6), but this requires a formulation akin to
the original generative score and thus incurs high complexity. Instead, we design the hypernetwork to directly adjust
the score _∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t | c_ ), corresponding to the network
parameters _θ_ in the original generative model, through producing a lightweight low-rank adapter (LoRA) for _θ_ .
We divide hypernetwork architecture into two main components: _perception encoder_ and _transformer decoder_, as
shown in Fig. 3. Concretely, the inputs temporal latent
**x** _t_, timestep _t_ and prompt **c** are first passed into perception
encoder, which consists of downsampling blocks from the
pretrained U-Net of the generative models. The pretrained
U-Net carries rich diffusion priors, making it a natural encoder to capture semantic representations across diverse input combinations. The encoded features are then projected
through a linear layer and passed to a transformer decoder,
where we use zero-initialized tokens to generate query (Q)
and use the encoded features to generate the key (K) and the
value (V). The transformer decoder integrates temporal and
semantic information via cross-attention, and a subsequent
linear layer maps the decoded features into LoRA weights:


∆ _θt_ = _hψ_ ( **x** _t,_ **c** _, t_ ) _,_ (7)


where _ψ_ denotes the parameters of hypernetwork _hψ_ . Temporally, integrating the generated LoRA weights into the
original model parameters yields a input-and-step-specific
score function **s** _θ_ +∆ _θt_ (with an abuse of notation +),
thereby modifying the underlying denoising trajectory.
**Efficient HyperAlign.** By default, the hypernetwork design in Eq. (7) can be applied at all generation steps adaptively starting from initial step _T_ (termed as HyperAlignS). We further develop two variants for balancing inference efficiency. (1) HyperAlign-I is trained to only predict the LoRA weights once at the starting point, ∆ _θT_ =
_hψ_ ( **x** _T,_ **c** _, T_ ), and used for all steps. (2) A piece-wise variants, HyperAlign-P, produces new weights at several key
timesteps, where all timesteps within the same segment
share the same LoRA weights. We compute the the relative
_ℓ_ 1 distance of one-step predicted latents, shown in Fig. 4,
while a small value indicates that adjacent latents are similar
to each other. The observations support that similar latent
states can be grouped into a single segment and share same
LoRA weights, aligning with the diffusion behavior across
different denoising stages. We compute the curvature rate
to identify _M_ keypoints that exhibit greater influence on the
trajectory. The hypernetwork is trained to regenerate LoRA
weights only at these keysteps to adaptively modulate the
diffusion process with less computations than HyperAlignS, balancing between efficiency and performance.


**4.3. HyperAlign Training**


To optimize the hypernetwork, we can use the reward score
as training objective. By maximizing the reward signals,

(6)
where the reward function is actually applied on the decoded image domain through the decoder. For simplicity
of discussion, we omit the decoder notation. By substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (4), we observe that the guidance-based
methods achieve alignment by injecting reward-aware diffusion dynamics into **x** _t−_ 1, which essentially changes the
transition path from **x** _t_ to **x** _t−_ 1.


**4.2. HyperNetwork for Test-time Alignment**


As discussed in Sec. 4.1, gradient-guidance methods perform test-time alignment by directly modifying temporal
states using reward-derived scores to adjust the denoising
trajectory. However, backpropagating gradients from the
reward model to the generator incurs substantial computational overhead, slows inference, and remains disconnected
from the generator’s training process.
To mitigate these issues while retaining task-specific
modeling benefits, we train a hypernetwork that efficiently
steers the generation trajectory according to the task, input, and current generation states. Its test-time alignment
capability is learned during training by injecting rewardbased guidance into the hypernetwork. Different from finetuning based alignments accommodate all combinations of
user intentions using a fixed set of parameters, our methods
is prompt-specific and state-aware, dynamically generating
adaptive modulation parameters at each denoising step to
align the generation trajectory.
**Hypernetwork as a dynamic LoRA predictor.** We aim to
learn a hypernetwork that takes **x** _t_ and **c** as input and outputs adjustments for each step of the generative process. A
naive approach would be to learn an alignment score as a

the model is encouraged to generate intermediate predictions with higher conditional likelihood, thereby aligning
the latent trajectory with the true conditional distribution:


_L_ R = _−_ E _p_ ( **x** _t_ )� _R_ ( **x** 0 _|t,_ **c** )� _._ (8)


**Regularization on reward optimization.** While maximizing reward objective drives the model to produce highreward, condition-aligned latent states, it also exposes two
key challenges: (1) inaccurate reward signals due to the
blurriness of one-step predictions in early denoising stages,
and (2) the risk of over-optimization, where aggressive reward maximization leads to reward hacking or degraded visual fidelity. To mitigate these issues, we incorporate a regularization loss to constrain the alignment process and preserve generation quality:

where _ηt_ denotes the hyperparameter, **x** 0 sampled from preferred data _q_ ( **x** 0) and **x** _t ∼_ _q_ ( **x** _t|_ **x** 0). We encourages the
learned denoising conditional score to match the score in
preferred data, regularizing reward hacking.

Our method is not limited to diffusion models, As mentioned, HyperAlign is not limited to diffusion models and is
also compatible with flow-matching models ( _e.g_ ., FLUX in
experiments). More details are in supplementary material.


**5. Experiments**


In this section, we conduct comprehensive experimental
evaluations to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. We flexibly apply it across various generative
paradigms and validate its performance through comparisons with existing state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover,
ablation studies are performed to substantiate the contribution of each component in our designs.


**5.1. Experimental Setting**


**Implementation Details.** We employ SD V1.5 [40] and
FLUX [26] as base models, paired HPSv2 [54] as the reward model. The preferred data used for regularization loss
originates from Pick-a-Pic [25] and HPD [54]. All our experiments uses four NVIDIA H100 GPUs.

**Datasets and Metrics.** We evaluate our method on four
datasets: 1K prompts from Pick-a-Pic [25], 2K from
GenEval [15], 500 from HPD [54], and 1K from Partiprompt [62]. We choose six AI feedback models to assess
the image quality: PickScore [25] and ImageReward (IR)

[57] for general human preference, HPSv2 [54], CLIP [38]
and GenEval Scorer [15] for prompt alignment, Aesthetic
Predictor [42] for visual appeal. All test images are produced with 50 denoising steps for fair comparison, where
the CFG scale is set to 7.5 for SD V1.5-based and 3.5 for
FLUX-based methods. _For all metrics, higher values indi-_
_cate better performance._


**5.2. Comparison with Existing Methods**


For comprehensive assessment, we compare our method
with training-based and test-time scaling models. The former covers RL methods with direct reward backpropagation

[37, 44] and different policy optimization paradigms including DPO [30, 52], KTO [28] and GRPO [59]. The latter
comprises reward gradient-based guidance [24, 56, 63] and
noise candidate search strategies [33, 39]. For noise sampling methods, we follow the original configuration by setting the number of noise candidates to 20 for BoN [33], and
using 20 local search iterations with 4 noise candidates for
_ε_ -greedy [39].


**5.2.1. Quantitative Analysis**


To objectively evaluate the performance of our method, we
conduct a quantitative comparison on the Pick-a-Pic dataset.
For fair comparison, all alignment methods only use the
HPSv2 scorer [54] as the reward model. The results are organized in Tab. 2 for SD V1.5-based backbones and Tab. 1
for FLUX-based backbones, respectively. It is observed that

our method effectively achieve alignment and outperform
the previous methods by adjusting the generation trajectory
step by step. The other two variants of our method also keep
competitive performance with faster inference. By contrast,
test-time methods suffer from under-optimization in preference alignment. However, DyMO [56], benefiting from
its semantic consistency objective, retains relatively high
text–image alignment reflected by the CLIP score. The finetuning alignment methods produce suboptimal results due
to due to the lack of input-specific adaptability. More metric
comparison results across various benchmarks are provided
in the supplementary material.

thetic quality. In contrast, test-time alignment methods generate image with unstable effects and noticeable artifacts.
Although training-based approaches achieve higher proxy
scores, they tend to be over-optimized. The generated results lack practical usability, exhibiting anthropomorphic
distortions and excessively saturated color tones. More visual results are provided in supplementary material.


**5.2.3. Inference Efficiency**


We report the average inference time for generating a single
image in Tab. 2 for SD V1.5-based backbones and Tab. 1
for FLUX-based backbones. Our method achieves superior performance while requiring only a few seconds per
image. When adopting the two-stage weight generation
strategies, the inference efficiency can be further improved
without sacrificing performance. In contrast, test-time scaling methods incur substantial computational overhead due
to gradient computation or repeated sampling during model
forwarding. Although such cost may be tolerable for smallscale models, it becomes prohibitive for large-scale backbones, where optimizing a single image can take several
minutes, making the approach impractical. Both test-time
alignment and our HyperAlign adjust the generative trajectory, however, the time cost of generating and loading
adaptive weights in our method is nearly negligible, further
demonstrating its efficiency and practicality.

**5.2.4. User Study**


We conduct a subjective user study on FLUX-based backbones by randomly sampling 100 unique prompts from the
HPD benchmark [54] and generating the corresponding images using our method and several state-of-the-art baselines.
A total of 100 participants are invited to evaluate each comparison group by selecting the most favorable image across
three criteria: Q1 General Preference (Which image do you
prefer given the prompt?), Q2 Visual Appeal (Which image
is more visually appealing?), Q3 Prompt Alignment (Which
image better fits the text description?). Fig. 7 shows the approval percentage of each method in three aspects, which
demonstrates our method outperforms the previous preference learning models on human feedback.


**5.3. Ablation Study**


To better understand the contributions of each component in
our framework, we conduct a series of ablation studies on
SD V1.5 [40] under the HyperAlign-S configuration unless
otherwise specified. The results are summarized in Tab. 3.
**Effect of preference data for regularization loss** _L_ **G.** Our
default configuration adopts HPSv2 as the reward model
and Pick-a-Pic as the preference dataset for regularization.
When replacing Pick-a-Pic with HPD while keeping HPSv2
fixed, our method still achieves strong performance, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.
**Effect of reward–regularization configurations.** Beyond HPSv2, we combine PickScore and different preference datasets to optimize the hypernetwork. All combinations lead to consistently solid outcomes, verifying that
HyperAlign can adapt to different reward and regularization sources. Our default choice, HPSv2 leans toward
text–image alignment while Pick-a-Pic dataset favors visual
appeal, provides balanced supervision that yields stronger
overall improvements across metrics.
**Effect of reward loss** _L_ **R.** We further examine the influence of the reward loss by supervised fine-tuning using only
preference data (Pick-a-Pic and HPD) and optimization using only reward signals (HPSv2 and PickScore). Results
show that supervised fine-tuning with preference data alone
yields marginal gains. Reward-only optimization boosts

most preference scores but severely degrades CLIP, indicating clear reward over-optimization.


**6. Conclusion**


We propose HyperAlign, a hypernetwork-based framework
for efficient and effective test-time alignment of generative
models. HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank modulation weights across denoising steps, enabling trajectorylevel alignment guided by reward signals. Its variants provide flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency
and alignment precision. Extensive experiments on both
diffusion and rectified flow backbones show that HyperAlign delivers superior semantic consistency and aesthetic
quality compared to existing fine-tuning and test-time alignment approaches. In the future, we aim to further enhance
dynamic adaptation while developing more lightweight hypernetwork designs to improve efficiency and scalability.

## **HyperAlign: Hypernetwork for Efficient Test-Time Alignment of** **Diffusion Models** Supplementary Material



**7. More Details of HyperAlign with Flow-**
**Matching Models**


As discussed in the main paper and demonstrated in the experiments ( _e.g_ ., experiments with FLUX), our HyperAlign
method can be applied to both diffusion and flow-matching
models, although the main paper primarily presents the formulation using diffusion models.
In Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 4.1, we discussed conditional generation under test-time diffusion guidance, where the denoising trajectory is adjusted by directly modifying the temporal states. This paradigm is also compatible with flowmatching models [26]. While the connections between diffusion and flow-matching models have been established and
unified formulations have been presented in prior work [59],
in this section, we provide more details for our method with
flow-matching models.
**Conditional flow-matching models and score functions.**
Different from reverse SDE in Eq. (2), a deterministic reverse probability flow ODE [46] takes the following form:

d **x** _t_ =    - **f** ( **x** _t_ ) _−_ [1] _t_ _[∇]_ **[x]** _t_ [log] _[ p][t]_ [(] **[x]** _[t]_ [)]    - d _t._ (11)

2 _[g]_ [2]


For flow matching, the score _∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t_ ) is implicitly
linked to the velocity field _vt_ . Specifically, we define **x** 0 _∼_
_pdata_ ( **x** ) and **x** 1 _∼N_ (0 _,_ **I** ), then the forward process can
be formulated as a linear interpolation:


**x** _t_ = _αt_ **x** 0 + _βt_ **x** 1 _,_ (12)


where _αt_ = 1 _−t_, _βt_ = _t_ and _t ∈_ [0 _,_ 1]. Under this construction, we have the distribution **x** _t ∼N_ ( _αt_ **x** 0 _, βt_ [2] **[I]** [)][, yielding]
the marginal score:


_∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t_ ) = E� _∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt|_ 0( **x** _t|_ **x** 0) _|_ **x** _t_  
(13)

= _−_ [1] E[ **x** 1 _|_ **x** _t_ ] _._

_βt_


For the velocity field _vt_ ( **x** _t_ ), we derive:


      -      _vt_ ( **x** _t_ ) = E _α_ ˙ _t_ **x** 0 + _β_ [˙] _t_ **x** 1 _|_ **x** _t_


= ˙ _αt_ E[ **x** 0 _|_ **x** _t_ ] + _β_ [˙] _t_ E[ **x** 1 _|_ **x** _t_ ]



In particular, we resort to rectified flow [32] setting for
better discussion. Substituting _αt_, _βt_ and Eq. (14) into
the sampling process _vt_ = [d] d **[x]** _t_ _[t]_ [and applying discretization]

yields the update rule:




[∆] _[t]_

1 _−_ _t_ [)] **[x]** _[t][ −]_ 1 _[t]_ _−_ [ ∆] _[t]_



**x** _t_ +∆ _t_ = (1 _−_ [∆] _[t]_



(15)
1 _−_ _t_ _[∇]_ **[x]** _[t]_ [ log] _[ p][t]_ [(] **[x]** _[t][|]_ **[c]** [)] _[,]_



where _pt_ ( **x** _t|_ **c** ) represents that flow-matching models learn
a distribution with conditioning variable **c** . For image generation, **c** is the input prompts indicating user’s instruction
for the generated contents. Similar to Eq. (4), this iterative
denoising process also forms a trajectory _{_ **x** _t}_ [0] _t_ =1 [in the la-]
tent space, gradually transforming the noise **x** 1 into a clean
sample **x** 0.
**Test-time alignment with reward-based guidance.** As
mentioned in Sec. 4.1, test-time diffusion alignment methods adjust the generative trajectory to better satisfy alignment objectives. Specifically, gradient-based diffusion
guidance directly compute the gradient from reward signals
and uses them to steer the denoising trajectory by modifying the temporal states. Similarly, based on Bayes’ rule, the
score _∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t|_ **c** ) in Eq. (14) can be divided into the
unconditional score _∇_ **x** _t_ log _pt_ ( **x** _t_ ) and the correction gradient _∇_ **x** _tR_ ( **x** 0 _|t,_ **c** ). Since the first term is independent of
the condition **c**, we focus on the second term, which injects
reward gradient into the velocity field:


_∇_ **x** _tR_ ( **x** 0 _|t,_ **c** ) = _∇_ **x** _tR_ ( **x** _t −_ _t · vθ_ ( **x** _t, t_ ))



_∂R_  = _·_ **I** _−_ _t ·_ _[∂v][θ]_ [(] **[x]** _[t][, t]_ [)]
_∂_ **x** 0 _|t_ _∂_ **x** _t_




- (16)

   - **x** _t −_ _βt_ **x** 1
= ˙ _αt_ E _|_ **x** _t_

_αt_




+ _β_ [˙] _t_ E[ **x** 1 _|_ **x** _t_ ]



(14)



where the reward function is actually applied on the decoded image domain through the decoder. For simplicity of
discussion, we omit the decoder notation. By substituting
Eq. (16) into Eq. (15), flow-matching models can achieve
alignment by injecting reward-aware dynamics into the latent states of the next timesteps. Essentially, modifying the
intermediate states between two timesteps corresponds to
adjusting the sampling trajectory, which shows that our proposed HyperAlign naturally extends to flow-matching models as well.

V1.5-based backbones and Fig. 11 for FLUX-based backbones, respectively. Compared to the baseline and existing models, our approach generates high-quality images
more closely aligned with contextual semantics and better
cater to human preferences. Moreover, all three variants of
our LoRA weight generation strategy achieve strong performance, further demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.
**Qualitative results on ablation studies.** In Tab. 3, We report ablation results examining the effects of different reward models and preference datasets. The experimental
metrics show that our method remains effective and robust across diverse reward–preference configurations. In
Fig. 13, we visualize the ablation study results. It is observed that the visual qualities of the generated image by
our method (HPSv2-based and PickScore-based) are consistent with the numerical results, enhancing both aesthetic
appeal and semantic correctness. Compared with SD V1.5

[40], supervised fine-tuning solely on preference datasets
yields only marginal gains. Additionally, we observe that
although reward-only optimization attains higher metric
scores, it leads to over-optimized and visually saturated
samples, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed method.
**Qualitative comparison on diversity.** Although DanceGRPO [59] and MixGRPO [27] achieve high quantitative
scores in Tab. 1, we further examine their generation behavior by sampling multiple outputs from the same prompt
under different random initial noises, as shown in Fig. 12.
We observe that both methods significantly reduce the inherent diversity of the FLUX backbone [26], producing im


ages that collapse toward a single style or even a single
identity, which is an indication of over-optimization. In
contrast, our HyperAlign framework achieves strong preference alignment while preserving the model’s native diversity, maintaining varied yet semantically faithful outputs
across different noise initializations.


**8.2. Additional Quantitative Results**


We conduct quantitative evaluation on GenEval benchmark

[15] and show comparisons in Tab. 4 for SD V1.5-based
backbones. The results show that our method performs very
well and shows superiority in many aspects, _e.g_ ., overall,
attribute binding and object synthesis. To further evaluate the ability to capture high-level semantics, we incorporate the CLIP score into the training objective following DanceGRPO [59]. The main quantitative results on the
GenEval benchmark for FLUX-based backbones are presented in Tab. 5. Corresponding qualitative comparisons are
provided in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15. Compared with HPS-only
optimization, jointly optimizing with both HPS and CLIP
objectives yields noticeably better semantic consistency.


**8.3. Additional Analyses**


**Dynamics of LoRA Weight.** We further analyze the intermediate dynamics of the hypernetwork-based trajectory
alignment using Stable Diffusion v1.5 [40]. Specifically,
we examine the LoRAs generated at different steps by
HyperAlign-S. Fig. 8 illustrates how the generated LoRA
evolves across the diffusion process relative to the LoRA at
the initial step. We compute both the cosine similarity and
the _ℓ_ 1 relative change of the LoRA at each step with respect

timesteps relative to the initial state _T_ . The cosine similarity and

to the initial step. The cosine similarity between the weights
at each timestep and the initial state at _T_ = 1000 steadily
decreases, while the _ℓ_ 1 relative change rate consistently increases. This indicates that the LoRA weights progressively
deviate from their initial configuration, highlighting the distinct functional roles played by different timesteps in the
diffusion process.
**Variation of LoRA Weights.** To further examine the LoRAs generated for different prompts at different steps, we
randomly sample 200 prompts and obtain their corresponding LoRAs across the diffusion process. We then perform
PCA on the LoRA parameters and visualize the top two
principal components in Fig. 9. The results show that HyperAlign produces distinct LoRAs for different inputs. The
variances, reflected by the spread of points in each subplot
of Fig. 9, are larger at the initial and early steps than at
later steps. This aligns with our observation that the generation process requires more prompt-specific alignment during earlier stages.


**8.4. Additional Details on Human Evaluation**


We administer our user study using structured survey forms,
where each prompt is presented as an independent section.
Within each section, we present multiple images generated
by different methods for the same prompt. Participants answer three questions: Q1 (Fig. 16), Q2 (Fig. 17) and Q3
(Fig. 18). Each question targets a different aspect of preference (overall preference, visual appeal, and prompt alignment), and participants are asked to select the most favorable image among the provided options. Participants are recruited via an online platform and remain fully anonymous.
To ensure reliable evaluation, all participants are required
to hold at least a bachelor’s degree, and their privacy and



identity are strictly protected throughout the study.


**9. Ethical and Social Impacts**


In this work, we propose HyperAlign, a hypernetworkbased test-time alignment framework for text-to-image diffusion or flow-matching models. While our method enhances alignment with human preferences and semantic
consistency with input prompt, it also introduces ethical and
social considerations that must be carefully addressed to ensure responsible AI deployment. Specifically, our method
is built upon pre-trained backbones and preference datasets,
which may inherit or amplify existing societal biases. To
prevent reinforcing stereotypes, we recommend auditing reward signals and ensuring sufficient dataset diversity. Moreover, stronger semantic control by our methods can increase
the risk of misuse, such as generating harmful, misleading,
or identity-revealing content, raising significant privacy and
safety concerns. To mitigate these issues, we advocate implementing safeguards, including content moderation and
clear ethical usage guidelines. Overall, the benefits of HyperAlign substantially outweigh these potential concerns.
The proposed framework lowers the barrier to high-quality
test-time alignment and improves accessibility for diverse
user groups. By balancing strong performance with ethical
responsibility, HyperAlign aims to support fairness, transparency and safe deployment in real-world applications.
