**Abstract** Future liquid-xenon (LXe) based observatories
for rare processes, such as XLZD, require testing of large
components and sub-assemblies in cryogenic liquid or
gaseous xenon environments. Here we present results from
the stable operation of a shallow dual-phase LXe TPC with
an inner diameter of 133.4 cm and a height of 3.1 cm in the
unshielded PANCAKE platform, without underground suppression of cosmic-ray backgrounds. A total of 340 kg of
xenon was used in the experiment, of which 127 kg constituted the active TPC mass. Measurements of the LXe puritydependent electron lifetime and the electron drift velocity in
LXe demonstrate that sensitive measurements to characterize the TPC performance are possible in a high-background
environment, even with a very basic PMT-based light detection system. Improving this will straightforwardly reduce
the TPC threshold, which was observed to be around 15 keV
for electronic recoils in TPC operation.


**1 Introduction**


Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers (LXe
TPCs) have led the direct search for dark matter in the
form of WIMPs with masses _≥_ 5 GeV/ _c_ [2] for more than a
decade [1], and several detectors at the multi-ton scale are
currently in operation [2–4]. In order to explore the entire
accessible parameter space before the sensitivity is seriously
impacted by irreducible neutrino interactions (the so-called
neutrino floor [5] or fog [6]), exposures of at least 200 t _×_ y
are required [7]. Two detector concepts capable of delivering such exposures are currently being discussed: PandaXxt [8] and XLZD [9], where XLZD plans to collect an exposure of up to 1000 t _×_ y in case a hint of a signal is seen at

smaller exposures. Due to its large target and very low background level, an instrument such as XLZD offers excellent
sensitivity to many other science channels [10], in particular
neutrinoless double-beta decay of [136] Xe [11] and precision
measurements of low-energy solar neutrinos [12].

The cylindrical XLZD TPC will have linear dimensions
of about 3 m, which is about a factor of two larger than
the current generation of detectors. Large-scale test facilities are therefore required to develop and test critical components for XLZD at full scale and under realistic cryogenic
conditions. The PANCAKE test platform is one such facility and allows for tests of large, flat TPC components [13].
It is installed in an unshielded environment at the University of Freiburg, Germany, and was not constructed from
dedicated low-background materials. As a result, it does
not provide the low-background conditions required for rare
event searches. In this work, we present the first operation
of a shallow dual-phase LXe TPC with a diameter of about
1.33 m in PANCAKE, demonstrating the diagnostic capabilities of the platform. The PANCAKE platform and its instrumentation are presented in Sect. 2, and details on the
installed TPC are given in Sect. 3. Additional instrumentation needed for the TPC operation is presented in Sect. 4.
The operation of the TPC is described in Sect. 5, and some
key results illustrating the capabilities of the facility are presented in Sect. 6.


**2 Experimental Setup**


The PANCAKE facility is the world’s largest liquid xenon
test platform to date, featuring a flat floor with an internal
diameter of 2 _._ 75 m. A detailed description of the facility,
which currently has a xenon inventory of 400 kg, and of its
commissioning can be found in [13]. Here, we highlight the

**Inner Vessel**



Thermal insulation of the inner vessel from the environment is achieved using support fixtures designed for minimal thermal conduction, by evacuating the volume between
the inner and outer vessels, and by installing RUAG Space
COOLCAT 2 NW superinsulation, which consists of 30 layers of 12 µm thick polyester foil. This effectively minimizes
the radiative heat load, resulting in a total cooling power requirement of approximately 100 W when the vessel is filled
with liquid xenon.

Two separate liquid nitrogen-based cooling systems are
available. The first is used to cool the steel of the inner cryostat from room temperature to approximately LXe temperatures via copper cooling pads directly attached to the stiffening structure of the lower inner vessel. The large heat capacity of the vessel dampens the effect of temperature variations
in the cooling system. Two of the pads can be seen in Fig. 1.
The system provides a cooling power of up to 600 W. This
is more than sufficient to meet the 100 W requirement. For
stable detector operation, only the second system, based on
a thermosyphon, is used. It continuously liquefies xenon gas
with an adjustable cooling power of typically 150 W.

Approximately 400 kg of xenon are currently stored in
a gas storage system consisting of six 50-liter gas bottles
that can be cooled to recover xenon from the cryostat via
cryopumping, as well as six bottles used to store warm gas.
The gas of any bottle can be fed to the inner cryostat via
the central gas panel. To purify the xenon gas, the gas panel
provides a KNF N143 SP.12E diaphragm pump, an SAES
Mono Torr PS4-MT15-R rare gas purifier, and a Teledyne
Hastings HFC-D-303-B flow controller. These components
are used during operation to purify the xenon gas. To reduce the heat load, the purification loop contains a custommade heat exchanger. The gas panel also allows for the installation of temporary equipment through a series of valves
and bypasses. For this work, a [83m] Kr conversion electron
source [14, 15] and a Tiger Optics HALO+ trace gas analyzer to measure H2O in xenon gas at parts-per-billion (ppb)
levels were installed.

In order to provide a dust-free environment for sensitive high-voltage tests and to avoid contamination of detector components, a commercial hard-wall ISO class 6 clean
room with a footprint of 10 m [2] was installed next to the cryostat as can be seen in Fig. 1. A cleanroom extension made
of polycarbonate panels on top and soft-wall curtains on the
sides surrounds the support structure and extends to the ISO6 clean room. To further reduce the dust ingress from outside the cleanroom between the curtains, thin polyethylene
(PE) foil was attached to the areas that did not need to be
opened. Three HEPA fan filter units were also installed on
the extension to provide airflow.

The PANCAKE facility uses the open-source slow control framework _Doberman_ [16] to read out all auxiliary sensors installed across the facility. Doberman has been devel

components relevant to the TPC operation and characterization in this work.


PANCAKE houses a vacuum-insulated stainless steel
cryostat consisting of an inner and an outer vessel. Figure 1 shows a photograph of the facility at the University of
Freiburg. The photograph was taken while the bottom part
of the outer vessel was lowered to allow a view of the inner vessel. The top lids of the cryostat vessels are suspended
from a support structure on three M48 rods, which allow the
detector to be leveled.


The inner vessel is designed to hold liquid xenon at
gas pressures of up to 3 bar absolute. It was sealed with
a 2 mm oxygen-free high-conductivity copper wire compressed between the cryostat flanges, yielding acceptable
leak rates [13]. Its flat floor reduces the amount of liquid
xenon required to submerge large-diameter components during testing. It was demonstrated in Ref. [13] that the effective cryostat diameter used for LXe tests can be reduced
by installing a cylindrical open-topped stainless steel vessel
with a flat floor in the inner cryostat. Thermally insulating
this vessel using poly-tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) standoffs
allows collecting LXe only in the open-topped vessel and
not on the inner cryostat’s floor.


On top of the cryostat, two CF-150 ports and six CF63 ports provide access to the inner vessel. These ports
pass through the insulation vacuum and are equipped with
feedthroughs to connect instrumentation and accessories,
with gas pipes and a pumping port. Four ports connect to the
outer vessel. The inner and outer vessels are evacuated using two independent Leybold Turbovac 450i turbomolecular
pumps. An MDC AV-600M CF-150 angle valve installed between the turbomolecular pump and the inner vessel allows
the evacuation port to be closed when the vessel is filled with
xenon gas.


oped over the past decade and was specifically adapted to
the requirements of PANCAKE: it interfaces with 34 devices and continuously monitors more than 300 parameters.
An effective alarm distribution system, remote control capabilities, and automated feedback pipelines enable stable
operation of the experiment by a relatively small team.


**3 Time Projection Chamber**


The TPC operated in this work had an cylindrical active volume with a diameter of 1334 mm and a height of 31 mm,
enclosing about 127 kg of LXe. It was built from three stainless steel electrodes, cathode, gate and anode, with support
frames of _∼_ 1 _._ 4 m outer diameter. These three electrodes
were built and tested to upgrade the XENONnT dark matter experiment [17]. They were biased independently and
no field-shaping electrodes were installed. The anode and
gate were parallel wire electrodes with 265 and 266 stainless steel wires of 216 µm diameter (California Fine Wire),
stretched along 24-sided polygonal stainless steel frames
with thicknesses of 24 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The
wire spacing was 5 mm. The cathode consisted of an etched
hexagonal stainless steel mesh with a thickness of 300 µm
and cell width of 7 _._ 5 mm, clamped to a circular stainless
steel frame of 20 mm thickness. The clamps increase the
overall thickness to 25 mm.


Fig. 2: Schematic side view of the inner cryostat with the
installed PMT array (gold) and TPC. The inset depicts the
electrode distances; the colored horizontal lines indicate the
electrode planes. The uncertainty on the distance between
the anode plane and the PMT array is around 10 mm.


The shape of the electrode frames and the _∼_ 400 kg of
available xenon defined the lateral dimensions of the TPC,
which was installed in a cylindrical open-topped vessel with
a diameter of 1460 mm and a height of 150 cm to increase
the LXe level around the TPC. The vessel was made of 2 mm
thick stainless steel, and supported by six PTFE standoffs
attached to the bottom of the vessel. A second "false" floor

made of a 3 mm-thick, mirror-polished stainless steel sheet
with a diameter of _∼_ 146 cm was installed inside the vessel
to create a flat surface below the cathode. The vertical position of the cathode plane, 25 mm above the vessel floor, was
chosen based on finite-element field simulations: This keeps
the electric field at the cathode frame well below 30 kV/cm,
even for cathode bias voltages around 12 kV. The orientation of the cathode frame was chosen to avoid that the thin
mesh electrode gets too close to the grounded vessel floor.
The TPC length was defined by the 31 mm distance between
the cathode and gate, see Fig. 2. When operated at 2 bar,
the LXe filling height above the floor was 60 mm, defining
the target liquid-gas interface 4 mm above the nominal plane
of the gate wires. The distance between the anode and gate
electrode planes was 8 mm, with the wires facing each other.
No system to precisely adjust the LXe level was installed,
which was thus defined by the amount of Xe inside the system and the gas pressure. With the anode and gate set to
+1 kV and _−_ 5 _._ 1 kV, respectively, and a cathode potential of

_−_ 5.5 kV close to the gate potential, a drift field of 140 V _/_ cm
was achieved, as verified by detailed COMSOL-based simulations. The corresponding extraction fields were 3 _._ 7 kV _/_ cm
in liquid and 7 _._ 2 kV _/_ cm in gaseous xenon, assuming the
liquid-gas interface at 4 mm above the gate. High-voltage
was provided to each electrode by Kapton-insulated cables.

Before TPC assembly in the ISO-6 cleanroom, the tensions of the anode and gate wires were measured independently (see Sect. 4.4). PTFE spacers and support structures
were used to build the TPC and to mitigate electric breakdown between the electrode frames due to high electric
fields. Additionally, 75 µm thick Kapton foil was used in
several positions to avoid direct line of sight between the
electrode frames and the lateral wall of the open-topped vessel to mitigate electric breakdown. Wherever precise definition of distances was required, e.g., to ensure the 8 mm distance between gate and anode, Torlon or PEEK spacers were
utilized. The anode frame was embedded in PTFE pieces,
however, the design was generally not optimized for light
reflectivity at the TPC edges since the small PMT array was
installed above the center part of the TPC, see Fig. 3.

Four capacitive levelmeters, as described in [13], were
installed around the LXe target at a fixed height with respect
to the gate/anode system to measure the LXe level. Based on
their reading, the entire PANCAKE platform was leveled.

A LXe extraction pipe as well as a funnel to collect condensed Xe from the condenser and the heat exchanger were
installed in the open-topped vessel for Xe purification. A total of 15 PT100 temperature sensors were installed around
the TPC. Three sensors were placed at the heights of the
cathode, gate, and anode electrodes around the TPC at four
azimuthal angles to closely monitor their temperatures and
temperature differences. Additional instrumentation, in particular the array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) installed

It was installed inside a cylindrical open-topped vessel of
1460 mm diameter which contained the entire LXe for the
run. PTFE components were used to built a shallow TPC

anode (purple). Only the top of the anode was covered with
PTFE reflectors. The PMT array was located centrally above
the shallow TPC.


about 150 mm above the anode plane, are described in the
next section.


**4 Instrumentation**


Various diagnosis tools were installed to understand the performance of the shallow TPC, with a focus on identifying
possible high-voltage issues as well as studying the performance of such a large TPC in an unshielded environment.
VUV light from interactions in xenon but also expected from
discharges can be either detected by VUV-sensitive PMTs
(see Sect. 4.1) or digital cameras that are also sensitive in
the VUV range (see Sect. 4.2). While the TPC electrodes
were biased, the bias voltages and currents provided by the
high-voltage system (see Sect. 4.3) were monitored by the
slow control system. Additional instrumentation included a
plastic-scintillator-based muon telescope (see Sect. 4.5) and
a device to precisely measure the tension of the electrode
wires (see Sect. 4.4), albeit not while they were installed in
the TPC.


4.1 PMT array and data acquisition


For single-photon detection and TPC characterization, one
array of 19 Hamamatsu R11410-21 photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs) with a diameter of 3 inches [18] was suspended
centrally from the inner cryostat lid in the Xe gas phase,
as shown in Fig. 3. The PMTs were arranged in a hexagonal structure with a distance of 102 mm between the PMT
centers and were fixed to two 3 mm-thick stainless steel



Fig. 4: Block diagram of the hardware in the PANCAKE
DAQ system: The 19 amplified PMT signals were digitized by three 8-channel waveform digitizers. Coincident
muon telescope signals above the discriminator threshold
produced a logic signal that was digitized by one the ADC
channels. For PMT calibration, a pulser drives an LED and
triggers all ADCs, where the trigger signal is distributed by
the Busy model which, in standard TPC operation, collects
Busy signals from individual ADCs for further distribution.
The ADCs are read out by a server via optical fibers.


plates using individual PTFE discs for electrical insulation.
High-voltage was provided to each PMT individually from
a CAEN A1535N power supply via Accu-Glass Kapton insulated wires. The PMT signals were read by RG196 A/U
coaxial cables with MMCX connectors. Three blue LEDs
were placed in different positions inside the inner cryostat
for PMT gain calibrations using an Agilent 33220A pulse
generator. Results are presented later in Sect. 5.1.


The data acquisition (DAQ) system is largely based
on the system that was successfully developed for the
XENONnT experiment [19]. The absence of a global trigger allowed data-taking in the unshielded environment by
accepting exposure losses due to deadtime and by increasing the self-trigger threshold for each channel by a factor six compared to XENONnT, which still digitizes 80%
of the single photoelectron distribution. The DAQ system
used here is illustrated in Fig. 4: The 19 PMT signals were
first amplified by a factor of 10 and then digitized by three
8-channel CAEN V1724 sampling digitizers, providing a
sampling rate of 100 MHz at 14-bit resolution. The ADCs
were time synchronized using a common clock and a synchronous acquisition-start signal issued by the crate controller shown in Fig. 4. During standard operation, the DAQ
was run in self-trigger mode, recording signals exceeding
a configurable self-trigger threshold independently for each
channel. The information from all channels was combined in
software based on their timestamps. A spare ADC channel
recorded the logical muon telescope (see Sect. 4.5) signal to

images were captured by the overview camera when the
cryostat was at room temperature (top) and when it was cold
and filled with liquid xenon (bottom). The images show that
the camera loses focus when being cold. This is likely due
to thermal shrinkage and is reverted once the camera is at
room temperature again.


allow for precise timing of tagged muons. Data processing
is described in Sect. 6.
The busy signals from the ADCs are collected by a
CAEN V1495 programmable digital multi-purpose module
(Busy Module), which issues a veto to all ADCs. Its custom firmware also features a periodic "fractional lifetime"
mode that enables data-taking only for a short time intervals.
This allows data-taking in very high-rate conditions avoiding incomplete data collection due to busy situations, whilst
maintaining a high single-photon detection efficiency. This
is an alternative to raising thresholds on the channels. During LED calibration of the PMTs, the ADCs are externally
triggered by a pulser via the Busy Module. The same pulser
also directly drives the LEDs inside the TPC.


4.2 Cryogenic cameras


Standard USB webcams can operate at cryogenic temperatures when they are being heated [13], and three such cameras were operated inside the inner vessel. The ELP 0.01

right corner across both images, can be resolved.


tics provides an overview image of the inner cryostat and
the TPC test setup inside. The image quality worsened during Xe operation, most likely due to thermal shrinkage in
the optical lens system of the camera, but remained sufficient to see smaller components, see Fig. 5. Additionally,
a Svpro 8.0MP USB camera module, equipped with a 550 mm CS mount optical lens and 10 _×_ zoom, was used
(grid camera). This camera allowed individual gate and anode wires to be resolved and even enabled observation of the
electrostatic sag with biased electrodes at cryogenic temperatures, see Fig. 6. An XLayer USB webcam was installed
as well but was not used further for the work presented
here. In the cryostat the cameras were connected via active
USB cables which were connected to Sub D-15 or multi-pin
feedthroughs.

Initially, tests to gradually increase the high-voltage
were performed while recording videos with one camera,
which were then manually analyzed to identify light emission in the footage. Later operations involved automatic,
real-time monitoring of all three cameras using a custom

6


developed program that processed the camera feed in real
time with OpenCV2 on a dedicated Linux system. This
package also allowed for increasing the frame exposure time
of the camera sensor, which increased the sensitivity of these
cameras to low light signal. The program processed the feed
frame by frame and only saved a frame if a light signal was
detected during the TPC operation of the detector, which increased storage efficiency.


4.3 High-voltage system


A CAEN N1470 module providing a maximum of _±_ 8 kV
and a current resolution of 5 nA was used to deliver high
voltage to the anode and the gate electrodes. The current
was monitored every second by the slow control system.
The electrodes were connected to SHV coaxial feedthroughs
via multi-stranded, Kapton-insulated HV cables from AccuGlass. These cables had a 10 kV DC rating and custommade copper connectors.
Two different high-voltage modules were used to bias
the cathode during the run. A Heinzinger 60000-3ump provided a maximum voltage of 60 kV at 20 µA current resolution. Alternatively, a CAEN N570 module with a maximum of 15 kV was used. Only the current readings from
the Heinzinger module could be read by the slow control system. Inside the cryostat, the cathode was connected
to a 30 kV DC-rated, multi-stranded, Kapton-insulated,
high-voltage cable from Accu-Glass. The cable was then
connected to a 40 kV-rated MDC HV40-1S-C40 ceramic
feedthrough via a PTFE-insulated copper conductor.


4.4 Wire-tension measurement system


The tension of the TPC electrode wires could be measured
in the clean room using a system that determines the wire
tensions by measuring the harmonic vibration modes of the
wires. The system was developed based on the ideas described in [20]. The device enables the tension of individual
wires to be monitored during electrode construction and before or after delicate operations. Here, it was used to check
the mechanical integrity of the wire electrodes after TPC operation in liquid xenon.
The oscillation of individual wires was induced by a
short jet of pressurized air, nitrogen, or argon gas. A red
class-2 laser was positioned above the wire and pointed at
it at a slight angle. A photodiode mounted next to the laser
observes the reflected light, whose intensity is modulated
due to the oscillating wire. The photodiode signal is preamplified on a custom PCB board and digitized by an offthe-shelf Sound Blaster Play! 3 USB sound card from Creative Technology Ltd. The digitized signal undergoes a fast



Fig. 7: **Top:** Two frequency spectra for a long and a short
wire, respectively, the normal and higher order modes are
indicated. **Bottom:** Tension differences for a representative
set of wires comparing the tension before and after the operation in liquid xenon. No significant tension change was
observed for any of the wires.


Fourier transform and background subtraction using a representative background spectrum. An algorithm for peak detection then analyzes the signal and identifies the normal
mode of the wire based on its amplitude and distance from
higher modes. The tension of an individual wire is computed from the frequency of the normal mode, the wire’s
length, diameter, and the density and Young’s modulus of
the wire material. Due to the finite measurement duration of
the oscillating wire and the resolution of the digitizer, the
frequency resolution is around 0 _._ 3 Hz, which translates into
an uncertainty in the wire tension of less than 0 _._ 2 N for the
wires used in this TPC.


The gas nozzle, laser, and photodiode were mounted on a
stainless steel carriage that moved along a rectangular stainless steel profile using a stepper motor at one end of the
profile and a timing belt. An energy chain guided the signal
and power cables, as well as the gas hose, from the motor’s
side to the carriage. Flexible supports at the ends of the profile allowed for flexible positioning above the investigated
wire electrodes. The system was semi-automated, and a full
electrode could be examined in about three hours.


Figure 7 shows frequency spectra for a long and a short
electrode wire. In addition to the normal mode, both spectra exhibit higher-order modes at multiples of the normal
mode. Due to their similar tension of a few Newtons and
significantly different lengths, the normal mode of the long
wire is at a lower frequency than that of the short wire. The
figure also illustrates the tension differences measured for
a representative set of wires before and after operation in

measurement uncertainty, suggesting no loss in tension.


4.5 Muon telescope


A muon telescope consisting of two plastic scintillator panels could be installed below the PANCAKE facility. The
panels of 10 _×_ 25 cm [2] and 10 _×_ 10 cm [2], respectively, were
fixed at a relative distance of 70 cm and each connected
to a PMT. In principle, the muon telescope can be rotated
to change the zenith angle; however, for the data presented
here, it was only installed vertically at several different positions across the cryostat diameter. It was used to tag events
in which a muon passed through the detector to evaluate the
detector response for events with known interaction position.
The discriminated PMT signals were fed into a coincidence unit to create a muon tag; this logical signal was digitized together with the PMTs in the xenon volume ensuring
proper time synchronization, see Sect. 4.1.


**5 Operation**


The PANCAKE platform was operated for about four
months at the end of 2024, with approximately 60 days of
TPC operation. Figure 8 shows several slow control parameters, such as as xenon gas pressure, temperatures, and the
LXe level during the TPC phase. The platform was operated
at xenon pressures of 1 _._ 2 bar and 1 _._ 3 bar to evaluate the impact of pressure on high-voltage stability. The xenon purification system was started after approximately 26 days. The
improving xenon purity was monitored using the HALO+
sensor, which is sensitive to H2O, as well as TPC data (see
Sect. 6.2.3).
The inner cryostat vessel was initially cooled down
by running liquid nitrogen through the six cooling pads
attached to the inner cryostat until floor temperatures of
_∼−_ 100 _[◦]_ C were reached. The temperatures around the TPC
electrodes were monitored by 15 PT100 temperature sensors. During operation, maximal temperature differences of
less than 10 K across the entire TPC were observed. For each
individual electrode, a maximal temperature difference of
about 5 K was found, keeping temperature gradients in a safe
range given the different heat capacities of electrode frames
and wires, which can lead to different thermal contractions.
Xenon was filled into the cryostat through the purification system with a typical gas flow of around 2 _._ 7 slpm.
The xenon condensed on the cold head of the thermosyphon
cooling system and was guided into the open-topped vessel.
The rise in liquid level was monitored by both the levelmeters and the grid camera, see Figs. 6 and 8. The TPC was

leveled by adjusting the three M48 support rods that support the cryostat before the final liquid level was reached;
this was informed initially by grid camera images and later
by the LXe levelmeter readings. Larger jumps and spikes
in the levelmeter readings compromised the leveling procedure; however, the results presented later are not severely
affected, since level difference was small across the area directly monitored by the PMTs. Improvements on the levelmeter response are essential for the next detector run. The
mean filling height based on all four level sensors after leveling is shown in Fig. 8.


To evaluate the energy threshold of the TPC, [83m] Kr was
injected into the purification gas flow. Data were acquired
in different configurations, for example with varying ADC
thresholds or TPC voltages. When biasing the cathode beyond _−_ 6 kV, large light emissions could be observed by the
cameras along the cable connecting the feedthrough to the
cathode frame, as shown in Fig. 9. As similar events, although far less luminous, were observed around sections of



anode and gate cables in the xenon gas volume, this suggests that the high-voltage range in this run was limited by
the installed cables.

was calibrated using one low-intensity, blue LED installed
close to the PMT array. The LED was driven by a signal
generator to produce a small light signal which generated a
PMT signal only 10 % of the triggers, increasing the likelihood for single-photon detection. Data were recorded in a
2 µs window around each trigger to allow for accurate estimation of the baseline signal before any LED-induced signal. The spectrum of integrated LED signals was fit by a
parametrized model of the SPE response to obtain the gain
for each PMT from the mean of the SPE peak.
The PMT voltages were adjusted individually to achieve
a gain of 5 _×_ 10 [6] PE per photon. The PMT voltages were
kept constant and the gains were regularly monitored. Figure 8 (Panel 4) shows that the gains remained stable within
10 % during TPC operation.
The afterpulse rates of the PMTs, caused by residual gas
in the tubes, were studied using the same pulsed LEDs with
increased light output, according to the procedure described
in [21]. All PMTs exhibited afterpulses from helium and argon. We defined the afterpulse rate as the probability of a
SPE producing a detectable afterpulse peak and found rates
of 0 _._ 1 % to 0 _._ 4 % for He [+] and Ar [+], while the rate for Ar [++]

was below 0 _._ 1 %. The signal size of these afterpulses varied
from a few tens to a few hundred PE; however, the average
remained below three PE, which did not impact the subsequent analysis.


**6 Results**


Results from detector operation are presented here. The detector was operated in light-only mode, i.e., without biasing
the electrodes, and in TPC mode. Background data from environmental radioactivity, mono-energetic conversion electrons from a [83m] Kr source and cosmic muons are used to
characterize the performance.
Here we focus on data acquired with the PMT array,
since the cameras integrate their signals over microseconds
and have a significantly higher detection threshold. Whenever the cameras detected a signal, the PMT waveforms
were fully saturated.
The digitized PMT data were processed using the analysis framework _strax_ [22] together with an experimentspecific extension, which is largely based on the XENONnT
processing chain _straxen_ [23] but uses parameters adapted
to the PANCAKE detector. After baseline subtraction, a

PMT _hit_ is registered when the waveform exceeds a fixed
threshold of 50 ADC counts. Hits from different channels
are grouped into intermediate objects called _peaklets_ if their
time separation is smaller than 80 ns, while isolated hits with
larger separations are stored separately. Peaklets are further
split using a natural-breaks algorithm [24] that evaluates
whether a waveform is better described as one or two segments. They are then classified as S1-like, S2-like, or unclassified using the peaklet size and rise time. This time is
defined as the interval between 10% and 50% of the cumulative signal, which is generally much shorter for S1s than for
S2s. Peaklets classified as S2-like are subsequently merged
with nearby S2-like peaklets and isolated hits if their temporal separation is sufficiently small, in order to undo potential
over-splitting of wide S2 signals. Finally, the S1-like peaklets and merged S2s are stored as _peaks_, a lightweight data
format containing the reconstructed pulse properties. Most
important for the subsequent event reconstruction and analysis are the integrated signal (area), converted into photoelectrons (PE), and the width, defined as the time interval
between 25% and 75% of the area.

6.1 Light-only analyses


Here we present results from operating the detector without
biasing the TPC electrodes. In this case, only S1 light signals are produced. The absence of field quenching results
in larger S1 signals than those produced in the presence of
electric fields (TPC mode).


_6.1.1 Muon-induced events_


As minimum ionizing particles (MIPs), cosmic muons deposit a fixed amount of energy per unit track length in liquid xenon. Muon-induced signals can therefore be used to
assess the uniformity of the detector response. The muon
telescope (Sect. 4.5) was placed in various positions below
the cryostat to tag muons when the detector was operated
in light-only mode. Coincident signals in both panels of the
muon telescope generated a square pulse that was digitized
by the DAQ system. This allowed the identification of PMT
signals from the LXe detector in coincidence with tagged
muon events. The data were collected using an increased
digitization threshold of 1000 ADC units per PMT channel
to reduce the number of small LXe signals that dominate the
rate. The low light collection efficiency in the outer detector
regions and accidental coincidences induced a sizable fraction of muon-tagged events without any signal in the LXe
detector.
Figure 10 shows the detector regions covered by two
muon telescope positions: one covers the PMT array, while
the second monitors the outer part of the LXe detector, with
the center of the active area being about 500 mm from the
central PMT. The two hit patterns shown in the bottom figure were generated by averaging all muon-tagged events at
the two positions and clearly show the expected shift in the
distribution of the PMT signals across the array. The 83%
reduction of the average muon signal from the inner to the
outer muon-telescope position agrees very well with the expected _∼_ 80% reduction of the averaged geometric coverage,
which is also shown in Fig. 10. The geometric coverage is
defined as the position-dependent fraction of photons produced in the LXe hitting a PMT photocathode. It was simulated ignoring light reflections and using a simplified geometry, but integrates over the entire LXe depth. The systematic uncertainty on the simulation is about 40%, dominated
by the positioning uncertainty of the muon telescope.


_6.1.2 Energy threshold_


Gaseous [83m] Kr released from a rubidium source was introduced into the detector by mixing it with the xenon
gas in the purification system. Due to its characteristic decay, which creates mono-energetic energy depositions at
32 _._ 1 keV and 9 _._ 4 keV in a fast delayed coincidence with a

Fig. 11: **Top:** Time differences between consecutive S1
peaks before (blue) and after [83m] Kr-injection (green). **Bot-**
**tom:** Rate difference between both datasets. An exponential
fit yields a half-life of 155(10) ns, compatible with the literature value for the decay of the intermediate [83m] Kr state.


half-life of 157 ns, [83m] Kr is a standard calibration source for
LXe TPCs [14]. Due to the specifics of how the source was
connected to the gas system and the dimensions of the piping, the calibration procedure required evacuating the pipes
toward the LXe detector prior to opening the calibration volume containing krypton mixed with gaseous xenon. About
one minute after the valve was opened, a rate increase of
approximately 3 % above the background S1 rate of around
9 _._ 3 kHz was observed.


The dataset is separated into periods before and after
this rate increase. Figure 11 shows the time difference _∆t_
between consecutive S1 peaks. At time differences below
900 ns, one can see a clear excess in the data with [83m] Kr
(green) with respect to the background-only data (blue). The
difference, shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 11, shows
the exponential shape of the excess. The fitted half-life of
155(10) ns is fully consistent with the literature value, confirming that these events were [83m] Kr decays. The typical
time separation of independent consecutive events is around
100 µs.


Figure 12 shows the corresponding signal area spectra
after applying a cut requiring a second S1 peak within 800 ns
before or after each peak. The excess of events compared to
the background data without [83m] Kr is clearly visible for S1
areas between the detection threshold at 2 PE up to about
30 PE. About 88 % of peaks with _∆t <_ 800ns come in pairs
of exactly two, as expected for genuine [83m] Kr events. In fact,
comparing the areas of the first and second S1 in these pairs,
shown in purple and green in the lower panel of Fig 12, the
results match the expected behavior of [83m] Kr where the first
decay deposits 32 _._ 1 keV and the second decay 9 _._ 4 keV. The
absence of narrow spectral features is understood as a consequence of the strong position dependence of the light collection in this geometry.



Fig. 12: **Top:** Signal spectrum of all S1 events within time
differences _∆t <_ 800ns. The increase from [83m] Kr events
is clearly visible. **Bottom:** The difference spectrum from
83mKr (orange) is separated into the spectra of the time ordered first (purple) and second (green) S1 peak from the
delayed coincidence decay of 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals, respectively. The 9.4 keV signal extends down to the
S1 threshold of 2 PE.


These results indicate that the signal from the 9 _._ 4 keV
transition is well above the effective S1 detection threshold
in the light-only campaign in the detector center. For calibration runs performed under TPC conditions, with drift
and extraction fields applied, no clear [83m] Kr delayed coincidence signature could be identified. This is partly attributed to field-induced quenching of the scintillation light
yield, which reduces the recombination probability of ionization electrons and thus the total S1 signal. A light
yield reduction of about 40 % is expected at drift fields
around 200 V _/_ cm [25], rendering a substantial fraction of
the 9 _._ 4 keV decays undetectable even in the center of the
PANCAKE TPC with the photosensor array implemented
for this work. Additionally, due to the presence of S2 signals, the background rate in the region of interest was found
to be significantly higher under TPC conditions, further
complicating the identification of [83m] Kr decays above the
ambient background.


6.2 TPC results


In this section, we present results from operation periods in
which all three electrodes were biased such that both prompt
(S1) and delayed (S2) scintillation signals were generated.


_6.2.1 Event identification_


Prompt scintillation signals (S1s) were paired with the corresponding delayed proportional scintillation peaks (S2s)
emerging from the same interaction. When operating in TPC
mode without the [83m] Kr calibration source, the rate at which


Fig. 13: Electron drift time of events with exactly one S1
and one S2 peak at a drift field of 140(10) V _/_ cm. A cut is
applied to remove events with drift times below 1 _._ 5 µs which
are likely to be from gas events or random coincidences. The
drop of events around 20 µs is due to the maximal drift time
across the TPC.


PMT signals exceeded the self-trigger threshold and occurred simultaneously across at least two PMTs was 21 kHz.
This high rate can be attributed to the large active volume of
the TPC and the absence of any shielding. The low light collection efficiency of the TPC at large radii moves many signals very close to the detection threshold. Therefore, several
quality cuts were applied to achieve a cleaner event sample. A time coincidence requirement, demanding signals in
at least three PMTs within 100 ns, effectively removes a substantial proportion of small, noise-like peaks while preserving genuine scintillation signals.

The algorithm then iterates through a time-ordered list of
the remaining S1 peaks and groups all additional S1s and all
S2 peaks following within a time window of 25 µs, which
is slightly longer than the expected maximal electron drift
time, into an event candidate. In about 80 % of cases, events
contain exactly one S1 candidate. No S2 signals are found in
42 % of the events, which correlates closely with the sizable
mass fraction of xenon below the cathode from which no
charges are extracted (25 mm of the total LXe filling height
of 60 mm).

Subsequently, events are required to contain exactly one
S1 and one S2, and very short drift times _t_ drift = _t_ S2 _−_ _t_ S1 _<_
1 _._ 5µs are rejected to suppress signals produced in the gas
region. This leads to the steep rise at small _t_ drift in Fig. 13.
The figure also shows that the algorithm identifies events
up to a maximal drift time of about 20 µs after which only
a small and constant number of accidental coincidences is
found, clearly suggesting that the paired S1 and S2 peaks
are indeed correlated.

Figure 14 shows that the S1 and S2 populations for the
selected events are separated in the signal width vs. area
space. This is mainly caused by the different signal width,



11


Fig. 14: Distribution of signal width vs. area from S1 and S2
peaks from paired events. Events with S2 widths above 1 µs
are rejected from the final event selection (gray area).


Fig. 15: Distributions of the S1 and S2 signal areas of the
final dataset after selection cuts. The median S1 (S2) area
is 31 PE (4051 PE) with the central 90 % located between

[10, 165] PE for S1s, and [393, 24137] PE for S2s). Interestingly, the background spectrum in combination with the
very position-dependent detector response leads to peak-like
distributions.


which is measured as the time interval around the peak maximum which contains 50% of the signal area. S2 signals with
widths above 1 µs were found to originate predominantly
from incorrectly merged multi-scatter peaks. A fraction of
these events is caused by tracks of atmospheric muons leading to signals with apparent widths of about 10 µs (i.e., 50 %
of the maximum drift time). For the final event selection, a
cut removing S2 events with widths above 1 µs is applied,
resulting in an event rate of about 750 Hz.

The S1 and S2 signal area distributions of the final event
sample are shown in Fig. 15. The median S1 and S2 areas


12


of 31 PE and 4051 PE, respectively, indicate a relatively low
light collection efficiency for prompt and secondary scintillation, consistent with Fig. 10. For comparison, gamma
interactions with _O_ (1 MeV) recoil energies, which make up
a large portion of the observed background events, lead to
S1 (S2) areas around 10 [4] PE (6 _×_ 10 [5] PE) in XENONnT [2].
Assuming negligible light reflection, the light collection efficiency is primarily determined by the solid angle subtended
by the photosensors. Given the shallow TPC geometry, no
significant difference is expected between S1 and S2 signals. The geometric collection efficiency for light emitted
at the LXe surface decreases from about 6 _._ 5 % at the TPC
center to about 0 _._ 2 % at the outer edge.


_6.2.2 Event waveforms and signal patterns_


A waveform of a typical event consisting of an S1 and the
much larger S2 signal is shown in Fig. 16. The drift time,
defined as the time difference between the centers of both
peaks indicates a rather central vertical _z_ -position of the
event. The hit patterns in the bottom panel show the recorded
signal fraction per PMT channel for both peaks. The centroids, defined as the signal-weighted average of the PMT
coordinates and indicated by the colored crosses, show a
very good match between the two peaks indicating their
similar position in the horizontal _x_ - _y_ -plane of the TPC. A
quantitative reconstruction of the horizontal position is not
attempted because of the limited area coverage of the small
PMT array.
In the TPC, S1 light is produced at the interaction point
of a particle, whereas the S2 light is produced in the gas
phase below the anode, directly above that point. In the shallow TPC operated here, these two points are always very
close together, with the majority of the displacement expected in the vertical direction. Therefore, the distribution of
light detected by the PMT array is expected to be similar for
these two signals if the S1 and S2 signals are correlated. Figure 17 shows that the spatial distance between the centroid
positions of the S1 and S2 signals is strongly correlated for
events identified as detailed in Sect. 6.2.1. Here, only larger
signals are considered, although this behavior does extend to
lower S1 sizes until the effect is washed out by low photon
statistics. Randomly paired events do not show such correlation, which further validates that the event matching between S1 and S2 peaks works well.


_6.2.3 Electron lifetime and xenon purity_


Liberated electrons from particle interactions may be captured by electronegative impurities (e.g., O2 molecules)
along their drift path, leading to a depth-dependent exponential attenuation of S2 signal sizes. The attenuation constant, the so-called electron lifetime _τe_, is a good indica


tor of the xenon purity in the TPC. The event selection described in the previous section is applied to all datasets acquired at different times, and _τe_ is individually determined
by fitting an exponential function to the median S2 area per
drift time bin, see Fig. 18. The resulting lifetimes _τe_ remain
consistent for datasets taken within a few hours, indicating
the feasibility of this method, which is typically applied to
mono-energetic calibration samples rather than background
events. During a period of ten days where xenon was constantly purified via a hot-metal getter at 8 _._ 5 SLPM gas purification flow, an increase in _τe_ from about 10 µs to 25 µs
was observed. This demonstrates that the current purification capabilities of PANCAKE as summarized in Sect. 2 are
sufficient to achieve a decent charge collection efficiency inside the shallow TPC with a maximal drift time around 20 µs
(see Fig. 13). The electron lifetime measurements were also
compared to the H2O concentration the xenon gas measured
by the trace gas analyzer a clear qualitative anti-correlation
between the two quantities.


_6.2.4 Electron drift velocity_


The performance of the PANCAKE TPC can be benchmarked by measuring the electron drift velocity in liquid
xenon, which depends on the TPC drift field. The drift time
between gate and cathode electrodes is determined by identifying the corresponding features in the reconstructed drifttime distributions: the cathode position in the time coordi

Fig. 16: Example of a typical waveform detected by the
TPC. The bottom panel shows the distribution of the S1 and
S2 signals across the PMTs. The almost identical location
of the distribution’s centroids (crosses) indicate a common
position in the _x_ - _y_ -plane, as expected for a properly reconstructed event.


Fig. 17: The distance between the reconstructed S1 and S2
centroid positions for reconstructed events (blue) exhibits
significantly smaller separations than that obtained from
randomly paired S1 and S2 signals (green). Only events containing exactly one S1 and one S2 are considered. A minimum S1 size of 50 PE is required, and events with saturated
channels are excluded to ensure a valid comparison.


Fig. 18: S2 area vs. drift time for a dataset with good Xe purity. The red dots indicate the median S2 area of all signals
per drift time bin which are described by an exponential decay function (red line). Low drift times are excluded from
the fit (grey dots) since the region is affected by the higher
extraction field above the gate electrode. The fit yields an
electron lifetime of _τe_ = (25 _._ 6 _±_ 1 _._ 5) µs.


nate _t_ cath is obtained from the sharp cutoff of the drift-time
spectrum (see Fig. 13), while the gate position _t_ gate is extracted from the transition in the ratio of S2 to S1 signals
as a function of drift time, where the field strength rapidly
changes from the drift to the extraction field. Both quantities
are determined using simple Fermi-like functions, following
the method described in Ref. [26]. The uncertainties include
the width of the transition region as well as the statistical fit
errors.
The drift velocity is calculated as

_v_ drift = _[z]_ [cath] _[ −]_ _[z]_ [gate] _,_

_t_ cath _t_ gate
_−_

where the _z_ -positions are known from detector design. The
corresponding drift-field strength is obtained from electrostatic finite element simulations using the median field between gate and cathode within the central detector volume.

Fig. 19: Field-dependent drift velocities measured in PANCAKE (red). Considering the spread typically attributed to
differing LXe temperatures, the results agree with previous
measurements [26–32].


The resulting drift velocities for the two tested PANCAKE TPC fields are shown in Fig. 19. Within uncertainties, the PANCAKE measurements follow the established
field dependence observed in previous experiments. The
closest agreement is found with the data of Gushchin _et_
_al._ [29], taken at a similar xenon temperature as our measurement ( _T_ = _−_ 106 _[◦]_ C), while measurements at higher
temperatures yield slightly lower velocities, consistent with
the known temperature dependence of the electron mobility
in LXe [30].


**7 Conclusion and Outlook**


With this work, we have demonstrated that a large, 100-kgscale shallow LXe TPC with a diameter of about 1.5 m can
be successfully operated for an extended period in an aboveground environment in the PANCAKE platform. The TPC
was built from electrodes used to upgrade the XENONnT
dark matter detector [17]. Despite the absence of an external
shield, minimal LXe self-shielding, and no special selection
of radiopure construction materials, proper events could be
reconstructed from the data. The validity of the event reconstruction was verified by studying the spatial correlation of
the centroid positions of the signals distributed across the
small PMT array. The data also enabled measurement of the
electron lifetime, which reached values exceeding the maximum drift time of the TPC. Finally, the data were used to
measure the field-dependent electron drift velocity.
For the future liquid xenon observatory XLZD, test platforms such as PANCAKE are of crucial importance for developing and testing large-scale components in cryogenic
liquid or gaseous xenon. While investigating the effects of
mechanical stress on large components resulting from cool

14


ing by about 120 K to LXe temperature is an important task
in itself, PANCAKE also enables testing of high-voltage
systems, such as TPC electrodes. To this end, the platform
was equipped with PMTs, installed in the gas phase above
the TPC, and cryogenic cameras. While the cameras are able
to identify and locate high-voltage induced sparks, the array of 19 PMTs is sensitive to much fainter light emissions
down to the single photon level. However, in this first test,
the PMT-based light detection system was not optimized.
In particular, no light reflectors were installed, resulting in
a rather low light collection efficiency in the center of the
TPC, which further decreased towards the edge. [83m] Kr calibration events, with a low-energy line at 9.4 keV, could be
identified in the TPC center in light-only-mode. This corresponds to about 15 keV when field quenching in a TPC drift
field of 200 V/cm is taken into account.

The detection threshold will be reduced in future runs by
adding light reflectors made from PTFE to increase the light
collection efficiency. This should then enable measurement
of the electron lifetime also with a [83m] Kr source. In addition,
injections of [222] Rn and [220] Rn into the Xe gas are planned
to explore other specific calibration patterns, such as [214] Bi214Po coincidences and high-energy _α_ -lines.
